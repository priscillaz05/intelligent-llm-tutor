Each film has a genre \u2014 an integer from 1 to k.\\n\\nOn the i-th day the festival will show a movie of genre a_{i}. We know that a movie of each of k genres occurs in the festival programme at least once. In other words, each integer from 1 to k occurs in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} at least once.\\n\\nValentine is a movie critic. He wants to watch some movies of the festival and then describe his impressions on his site.\\n\\nAs any creative person, Valentine is very susceptive. After he watched the movie of a certain genre, Valentine forms the mood he preserves until he watches the next movie. If the genre of the next movie is the same, it does not change Valentine's mood. If the genres are different, Valentine's mood changes according to the new genre and Valentine has a stress.\\n\\nValentine can't watch all n movies, so he decided to exclude from his to-watch list movies of one of the genres. In other words, Valentine is going to choose exactly one of the k genres and will skip all the movies of this genre. He is sure to visit other movies.\\n\\nValentine wants to choose such genre x (1 \u2264 x \u2264 k), that the total number of after-movie stresses (after all movies of genre x are excluded) were minimum.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and k (2 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 10^5), where n is the number of movies and k is the number of genres.\\n\\nThe second line of the input contains a sequence of n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 k), where a_{i} is the genre of the i-th movie. It is guaranteed that each number from 1 to k occurs at least once in this sequence.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nPrint a single number \u2014 the number of the genre (from 1 to k) of the excluded films. If there are multiple answers, print the genre with the minimum number.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n10 3\\n1 1 2 3 2 3 3 1 1 3\\n\\nOutput\\n3\\nInput\\n7 3\\n3 1 3 2 3 1 2\\n\\nOutput\\n1\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first sample if we exclude the movies of the 1st genre, the genres 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3 remain, that is 3 stresses; if we exclude the movies of the 2nd genre, the genres 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3 remain, that is 3 stresses; if we exclude the movies of the 3rd genre the genres 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1 remain, that is 2 stresses.\\n\\nIn the second sample whatever genre Valentine excludes, he will have exactly 3 stresses.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"(n, k) = map(int, input().split())\\nr = list(map(int, input().split()))\\ndist = []\\nans = [0] * (k + 1)\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\tif i == 0 or r[i] != r[i - 1]:\\n\\t\\tdist.append(r[i])\\nfor i in range(len(dist)):\\n\\tif 0 < i < len(dist) - 1 and dist[i - 1] == dist[i + 1]:\\n\\t\\tans[dist[i]] += 2\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tans[dist[i]] += 1\\n(u, v) = (-1, -1)\\nfor k in range(1, k + 1):\\n\\tif ans[k] > u:\\n\\t\\t(u, v) = (ans[k], k)\\nprint(v)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires finding a genre to exclude from a film festival to minimize the number of stresses Valentine experiences. A stress occurs when he watches movies of different genres consecutively.\\n- Data Preprocessing: Input involves number of movies (n), number of genres (k), and the sequence of movie genres shown each day. The task requires analyzing the sequence to calculate stresses.\\n- Algorithmic Approach: The main idea is to iterate through each genre, simulate excluding it, and calculate the resulting stresses. The genre yielding the minimum stress is the answer.\\n- Detailed Steps: First, read the input to get n, k, and the array of genres. Remove consecutive duplicate genres to reduce complexity. Iterate through each genre from 1 to k. For each genre, filter out its occurrences from the reduced genre sequence. Calculate the stresses based on the filtered sequence by checking for consecutive different genres. Track the genre with the lowest stress count.\\n- Optimization and Edge Cases: Optimize stress calculation by pre-computing a reduced genre sequence without consecutive duplicates. Handle edge cases such as an empty filtered sequence after excluding a genre, although this is handled by the fact that each genre appears at least once.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the primary goal of the problem, and how do stresses relate to it?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently simulate the exclusion of a genre from the sequence of movies?\",\n    \"What data structure can be used to track and update the minimum stress and its corresponding genre?\",\n    \"How can the consecutive duplicate movies be handled effectively to reduce the computation complexity?\",\n    \"What are some edge cases to consider and how to handle them so that your algorithm does not fail?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The primary goal is to minimize the number of stresses by excluding one genre. Stresses occur when Valentine watches movies of different genres consecutively, so we need to minimize these genre switches.\",\n    \"To simulate excluding a genre, iterate through the original sequence and create a new filtered sequence that does not include the target genre. This can be efficiently done by creating a new list and only adding elements that are not the excluded genre.\",\n    \"A simple variable can be used to store the minimum stress found so far, and another variable can store the corresponding genre. These can be updated each time a new filtered sequence results in a lower stress count.\",\n    \"Consecutive duplicate movies can be reduced to a single occurrence by iterating through the original sequence and creating a reduced sequence where consecutive duplicates are eliminated. This simplification reduces computation during stress calculation.\",\n    \"One edge case could be if excluding a genre results in an empty or single-element filtered sequence, which means there are no stresses or one less stress. Another edge case is when several genres all produce the same minimum stress. In such case, the smallest genre number should be outputted.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
