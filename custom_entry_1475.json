Fox Ciel has m cards, each one has these two attributes too. It's known that position of all Ciel's cards is Attack.\\n\\nNow is Ciel's battle phase, Ciel can do the following operation many times:  Choose one of her cards X. This card mustn't be chosen before.  If Jiro has no alive cards at that moment, he gets the damage equal to (X's strength). Otherwise, Ciel needs to choose one Jiro's alive card Y, then:   If Y's position is Attack, then (X's strength)  \u2265  (Y's strength) must hold. After this attack, card Y dies, and Jiro gets the damage equal to (X's strength) - (Y's strength).  If Y's position is Defense, then (X's strength)  >  (Y's strength) must hold. After this attack, card Y dies, but Jiro gets no damage.  \\n\\nCiel can end her battle phase at any moment (so, she can use not all her cards). Help the Fox to calculate the maximal sum of damage Jiro can get.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of cards Jiro and Ciel have.\\n\\nEach of the next n lines contains a string position and an integer strength (0 \u2264 strength \u2264 8000) \u2014 the position and strength of Jiro's current card. Position is the string \\\"ATK\\\" for attack, and the string \\\"DEF\\\" for defense.\\n\\nEach of the next m lines contains an integer strength (0 \u2264 strength \u2264 8000) \u2014 the strength of Ciel's current card.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nOutput an integer: the maximal damage Jiro can get.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n2 3\\nATK 2000\\nDEF 1700\\n2500\\n2500\\n2500\\n\\nOutput\\n3000\\n\\nInput\\n3 4\\nATK 10\\nATK 100\\nATK 1000\\n1\\n11\\n101\\n1001\\n\\nOutput\\n992\\n\\nInput\\n2 4\\nDEF 0\\nATK 0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n\\nOutput\\n1\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first test case, Ciel has 3 cards with same strength. The best strategy is as follows. First she uses one of these 3 cards to attack \\\"ATK 2000\\\" card first, this attack destroys that card and Jiro gets 2500 - 2000 = 500 damage. Then she uses the second card to destroy the \\\"DEF 1700\\\" card. Jiro doesn't get damage that time. Now Jiro has no cards so she can use the third card to attack and Jiro gets 2500 damage. So the answer is 500 + 2500 = 3000.\\n\\nIn the second test case, she should use the \\\"1001\\\" card to attack the \\\"ATK 100\\\" card, then use the \\\"101\\\" card to attack the \\\"ATK 10\\\" card. Now Ciel still has cards but she can choose to end her battle phase. The total damage equals (1001 - 100) + (101 - 10) = 992.\\n\\nIn the third test case note that she can destroy the \\\"ATK 0\\\" card by a card with strength equal to 0, but she can't destroy a \\\"DEF 0\\\" card with that card.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"(n, m) = map(int, input().split())\\n(a, d) = ([], [])\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\t(t, val) = input().split()\\n\\t(a if t == 'ATK' else d).append(int(val))\\nmy = sorted([int(input()) for i in range(m)])\\na.sort()\\nd.sort()\\n\\ndef solve1():\\n\\tret = 0\\n\\tused = [False] * m\\n\\tfor val in d:\\n\\t\\tfor i in range(m):\\n\\t\\t\\tif not used[i] and my[i] > val:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tused[i] = True\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\treturn 0\\n\\tfor val in a:\\n\\t\\tfor i in range(m):\\n\\t\\t\\tif not used[i] and my[i] >= val:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tused[i] = True\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tret += my[i] - val\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\treturn 0\\n\\treturn ret + sum([my[i] for i in range(m) if not used[i]])\\n\\ndef solve2():\\n\\tret = 0\\n\\tfor k in range(min(len(a), m)):\\n\\t\\tif my[-k - 1] >= a[k]:\\n\\t\\t\\tret += my[-k - 1] - a[k]\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\treturn ret\\nprint(max(solve1(), solve2()))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the problem: The problem describes a card game where Fox Ciel attacks Jiro's cards to maximize the damage inflicted. Jiro has attack and defense cards with strengths, and Ciel has only attack cards with strengths. The rules of engagement depend on whether Jiro's card is in attack or defense position.\\n- Identifying constraints: Ciel's attack cards can only be used once. When attacking, Ciel must choose an appropriate card based on Jiro's card position (ATK or DEF) and strength.\\n- Formulating a strategy: There are two main strategies to consider. The first strategy prioritizes taking out defense cards before attacking attack cards, maximizing potential future damage if Ciel has leftover cards to directly inflict damage on Jiro when no Jiro cards are left. The second strategy aims to maximize the damage by only attacking attack cards. The optimal approach will likely involve a combination of these, considering the strengths of both Ciel and Jiro's cards.\\n- Dealing with edge cases: Handling cases where Ciel doesn't have enough cards to attack all of Jiro's cards, or where some of Ciel's cards are too weak to attack certain Jiro cards is important. Also, handling cases where Ciel has leftover cards after attacking all of Jiro's cards.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the two main strategies Ciel can employ and how do they differ in their objective?\",\n    \"How does the position of Jiro's cards (ATK vs DEF) affect the damage calculation and the constraints on Ciel's card choice?\",\n    \"How should Ciel prioritize her attacks considering the strengths of her and Jiro's cards?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases that need to be considered when implementing a solution?\",\n    \"After Ciel eliminates all of Jiro's cards, what should happen?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The two main strategies are: 1) prioritizing defense cards to potentially inflict direct damage on Jiro later, and 2) maximizing damage by only targeting attack cards. The first strategy aims to clear the board to enable direct attacks, while the second aims to maximize damage dealt per attack.\",\n    \"If Jiro's card is in ATK position, Ciel's card must have strength greater than or equal to Jiro's card's strength, and the damage is Ciel's strength minus Jiro's strength. If Jiro's card is in DEF position, Ciel's card must have strength strictly greater than Jiro's card's strength, and there's no damage dealt.\",\n    \"Ciel should prioritize attacking defense cards with the weakest possible attack cards that still satisfy the condition (strength greater than Jiro's DEF card), and then use her stronger cards on Jiro's attack cards to maximize damage dealt (strength difference).\",\n    \"Edge cases include: Ciel having fewer cards than Jiro, some of Ciel's cards not being strong enough to attack some of Jiro's cards (especially DEF cards), and Ciel having leftover cards after defeating all of Jiro's cards.\",\n    \"If Ciel eliminates all of Jiro's cards and has cards remaining, she inflicts direct damage to Jiro for each remaining card, equal to the card's strength.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
