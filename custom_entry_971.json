Do not reverse the order of the words, just the letters in each word.\\n\\nIf there is punctuation, it should be interpreted as a regular character; no special rules.\\n\\nIf there is spacing before/after the input string, leave them there.\\n\\nString will not be empty.\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\n```\\n\\\"Hi mom\\\" => \\\"iH mom\\\"\\n\\\" A fun little challenge! \\\" => \\\" A nuf elttil !egnellahc \\\"\\n```\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def reverser(sentence):\\n\\treturn ' '.join((i[::-1] for i in sentence.split(' ')))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The task is to reverse each word in a given sentence while maintaining the original word order and handling punctuation as regular characters. Leading/trailing spaces should be preserved.\\n- Breaking Down the Task: The sentence needs to be split into individual words. Each word should be reversed. The reversed words should be joined back together, preserving the original spacing.\\n- Selecting Appropriate Methods: Splitting the sentence by spaces using the `split()` method. Reversing each word using string slicing `[::-1]`. Joining the reversed words back into a sentence with spaces using `join()`.\\n- Edge Cases and Considerations: Handling multiple spaces between words, leading or trailing spaces, and punctuation within words. Ensuring the code doesn't introduce extra spaces or modify the intended spacing.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you split the sentence into individual words while preserving multiple spaces between words or leading/trailing spaces?\",\n    \"How can you reverse a single word in Python?\",\n    \"After reversing individual words, how can you efficiently reconstruct the sentence with the correct spacing?\",\n    \"What would happen if the input string had multiple spaces between words? Does the solution preserve this?\",\n    \"How does the solution handle punctuation characters in the words?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The `split(' ')` method is used to split the sentence by spaces. This preserves multiple spaces between words or leading/trailing spaces because these spaces become empty strings in the resulting list.\",\n    \"A single word can be reversed using string slicing with a step of -1, like `word[::-1]`.\",\n    \"The reversed words can be joined back into a sentence using the `join()` method with a space as the separator: `' '.join(reversed_words)`.\",\n    \"The solution preserves multiple spaces because the empty strings generated by multiple spaces after splitting are included in the list and rejoined with spaces.\",\n    \"Punctuation characters are treated as regular characters and are reversed along with the other letters in the word.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
