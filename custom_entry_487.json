However, the effects of the poison show only in 30 days. The managers asks the jailor to identify the poisoned sweet within 30 days. What is the least number of prisoners the jailor must employ to identify the poisoned sweet?\\nNote: A sweet can be eaten by any number of prisoners.\\n \\nExample 1:\\nInput:\\nN = 3\\nOutput:\\n2\\nExplanation:\\nThe poison can be identified using\\nonly 2 prisoners.\\nExample 2:\\nInput:\\nN = 2\\nOutput:\\n1\\nExplanation:\\nThe poison can be identified using\\nonly 1 prisoner.\\n \\nYour Task:\\nYou don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function numOfPrisoners() which takes an Integer N as input and returns the minimum number of prisoners required to identify the poisoned sweet.\\n \\nExpected Time Complexity: O(log(N))\\nExpected Auxiliary Space: O(1)\\n \\nConstraints:\\n1 <= N <= 10^{9}\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"class Solution:\\n\\n\\tdef numOfPrisoners(self, N):\\n\\t\\tif N == 1:\\n\\t\\t\\treturn 0\\n\\t\\tc = int(math.log2(N))\\n\\t\\tif 2 ** c < N:\\n\\t\\t\\tc += 1\\n\\t\\treturn c\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: Recognize that each sweet represents a possible state and each prisoner can test a subset of sweets.\\n- Strategy Selection: Consider that each prisoner's fate (dies or survives) gives us a bit of information. To differentiate between N sweets, we need enough bits to represent N different possibilities. This suggests using a binary representation for sweets and prisoners.\\n- Logarithmic Relationship: Realize that the number of prisoners needed is related to the logarithm base 2 of N, as each prisoner provides one bit of information.\\n- Edge Case Handling: Note that if N = 1, no prisoners are needed as the sweet is definitely not poisoned.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can each prisoner's survival or death be used to narrow down the possibilities of which sweet is poisoned?\",\n    \"Why is a binary representation relevant to solving this problem?\",\n    \"How do you handle the case where N is a power of 2 versus when it is not?\",\n    \"How can the time constraint of 30 days be related to the solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Each prisoner can be assigned a specific combination of sweets to taste. If a prisoner dies, it narrows the possibilities to only the sweets that prisoner tasted. If a prisoner survives, it eliminates the sweets that prisoner tasted from being poisoned.\",\n    \"A binary representation allows each sweet to be uniquely identified by a combination of prisoners. Each prisoner represents a bit, and the state of that prisoner (alive or dead) corresponds to the bit value (0 or 1).\",\n    \"If N is a power of 2, the logarithm base 2 will be an integer, directly giving the minimum number of prisoners needed. If N is not a power of 2, the logarithm will be a decimal. Rounding up to the nearest integer provides enough prisoners to uniquely identify each sweet.\",\n    \"The time constraint of 30 days is a given condition of the problem, thus the solution has to work under the assumption that there is no more than 30 days to find the poisoned sweet. The time constraint doesn't really factor into the algorithm since we're just looking for the minimum number of prisoners needed to test the sweets, assuming the poison takes 30 days to take effect\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
