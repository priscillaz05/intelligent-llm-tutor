The game also has a counter of consecutive correct answers. When the player answers a question correctly, the number on this counter increases by 1. If the player answers a question incorrectly, the counter is reset, that is, the number on it reduces to 0. If after an answer the counter reaches the number k, then it is reset, and the player's score is doubled. Note that in this case, first 1 point is added to the player's score, and then the total score is doubled. At the beginning of the game, both the player's score and the counter of consecutive correct answers are set to zero.\\n\\nManao remembers that he has answered exactly m questions correctly. But he does not remember the order in which the questions came. He's trying to figure out what his minimum score may be. Help him and compute the remainder of the corresponding number after division by 1000000009 (109 + 9).\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe single line contains three space-separated integers n, m and k (2 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 109; 0 \u2264 m \u2264 n).\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the remainder from division of Manao's minimum possible score in the quiz by 1000000009 (109 + 9).\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nInput\\n\\n5 3 2\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n5 4 2\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n6\\n\\nNote\\n\\nSample 1. Manao answered 3 questions out of 5, and his score would double for each two consecutive correct answers. If Manao had answered the first, third and fifth questions, he would have scored as much as 3 points.\\n\\nSample 2. Now Manao answered 4 questions. The minimum possible score is obtained when the only wrong answer is to the question 4.\\n\\nAlso note that you are asked to minimize the score and not the remainder of the score modulo 1000000009. For example, if Manao could obtain either 2000000000 or 2000000020 points, the answer is 2000000000 mod 1000000009, even though 2000000020 mod 1000000009 is a smaller number.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def chk(x):\\n\\td = (m - x) // (k - 1) * k\\n\\tif (m - x) % (k - 1):\\n\\t\\td += 1 + (m - x) % (k - 1)\\n\\tif d <= n - x:\\n\\t\\treturn True\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\treturn False\\n\\ndef calc(e):\\n\\tif e == 1:\\n\\t\\treturn 2\\n\\tif e & 1:\\n\\t\\td = 2\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\td = 1\\n\\tf = calc(e >> 1)\\n\\td = d * f % D * f % D\\n\\treturn d\\n(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())\\nD = 1000000009\\nl = 0\\nh = n\\nwhile l < h:\\n\\tmid = l + h >> 1\\n\\tif chk(mid):\\n\\t\\th = mid\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tl = mid + 1\\nh = calc(l // k + 1) - 2\\nif h < 0:\\n\\th += D\\nprint((k * h % D + m - l // k * k) % D)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The goal is to minimize the score in a quiz given n questions, m correct answers, and a doubling mechanic that triggers after k consecutive correct answers. The final answer should be the score modulo 1000000009.\\n- Identifying the Minimization Strategy: To minimize the score, we want to minimize the number of times the score is doubled. This can be achieved by distributing the correct answers as sparsely as possible, which means maximizing the number of streaks of length less than k.\\n- Developing an Algorithm: Binary search can be employed to find the maximum number of incorrect answers at the beginning such that a feasible arrangement of the m correct answers and n total questions exists. Then, calculate the minimum score based on this optimal arrangement.\\n- Handling Modulo Arithmetic: Since the score can be very large, perform all intermediate calculations modulo 1000000009 to avoid integer overflow and obtain the correct result.\\n- Edge Cases and Constraints: Consider constraints on n, m, and k to ensure the correctness of the algorithm. Also, handle the specific modulo arithmetic requirements.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you minimize the score given that it doubles every k consecutive correct answers?\",\n    \"Can you explain the logic behind using a binary search in this problem?\",\n    \"How can you determine if a particular arrangement of correct and incorrect answers is feasible?\",\n    \"How do you handle potential integer overflows when calculating the score?\",\n    \"What are the key edge cases that must be considered in the problem, and how can you account for them in your solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"To minimize the score, you need to minimize the number of times the score doubles. This is achieved by distributing the correct answers as sparsely as possible, avoiding consecutive streaks of length k whenever possible.\",\n    \"A binary search is used to find the optimal number of incorrect answers (x) to place at the beginning of the quiz. By maximizing x, you reduce the opportunities for doubling and thus minimize the total score.  Binary search helps us efficiently find the largest such x that maintains feasibility.\",\n    \"To determine if an arrangement is feasible, check if the remaining incorrect answers (n - x) are sufficient to break all the potential streaks of k consecutive correct answers in the m correct answers. A helper function `chk(x)` determines if a given 'x' is valid.\",\n    \"To avoid integer overflows, you should perform all arithmetic operations modulo 1000000009. Apply the modulo operator after each multiplication to keep the numbers within a manageable range.  Also use a helper function to exponentiate, taking modulus at each step.\",\n    \"Key edge cases include scenarios where m is 0 or m is n. Ensure the modulo operation is correctly applied at each step to avoid negative remainders. Also note the case where no score doubling exists because it adds complexity to the calculation.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
