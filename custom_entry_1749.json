Once the GCD is found, the number of squares can be computed.\\n- Devising the Algorithm:  First, find the GCD of L and B. Then, calculate the number of squares required by dividing the area of the rectangle by the area of the square derived from the GCD. Specifically, N = (L * B) / (GCD * GCD). The dimension of the square, K, is equal to the GCD.\\n- Optimizing for Efficiency: Since the constraints require an O(log min(L, B)) time complexity, an efficient GCD algorithm like Euclidean algorithm needs to be used.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the significance of finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of L and B in solving this problem?\",\n    \"How does knowing the GCD of L and B help in determining the minimum number of squares (N) needed to cover the rectangle without any residue?\",\n    \"What approach can be used to compute the GCD of two large numbers efficiently, given the logarithmic time complexity constraint?\",\n    \"Explain the formula for calculating the number of squares (N) once the GCD is known.

Knowing the GCD allows us to calculate the area of each square (GCD * GCD) and then determine how many such squares are needed to cover the entire rectangle.\",\n    \"The Euclidean algorithm or its variations (like the binary GCD algorithm) can be used. These algorithms recursively compute the GCD efficiently in logarithmic time complexity.\",\n    \"The formula is N = (L * B) / (GCD * GCD). Dividing the area of the rectangle (L * B) by the area of each square (GCD * GCD) yields the number of squares needed to completely cover the rectangle.
