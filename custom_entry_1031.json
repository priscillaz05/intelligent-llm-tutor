Some element of this array a_{i} is a local minimum iff it is strictly less than both of its neighbours (that is, a_{i} < a_{i} - 1 and a_{i} < a_{i} + 1). Also the element can be called local maximum iff it is strictly greater than its neighbours (that is, a_{i} > a_{i} - 1 and a_{i} > a_{i} + 1). Since a_1 and a_{n} have only one neighbour each, they are neither local minima nor local maxima.\\n\\nAn element is called a local extremum iff it is either local maximum or local minimum.

Recognizing that the first and last elements of the array are never local extrema.\\n- Edge Case Awareness: Acknowledging that boundary elements (first and last) have only one neighbor and thus can\u2019t be local extrema.\\n- Looping and Conditional Logic: Planning a loop to iterate through the array, checking the neighbors of each element to determine if it is a local minimum or maximum.\\n- Counting Extrema: Implementing a counter to keep track of the number of local extrema found.\\n- Input Handling: Getting input of array size and array from the user and mapping elements to integers.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you define a local minimum and a local maximum in an array, and what are the conditions that must be met?\",\n    \"Why are the first and last elements of the array excluded from being considered local extrema?\",\n    \"How will you iterate through the array to check each element for the local extremum property, and what index range will you consider?\",\n    \"How will you handle checking the neighbors of each element, given that array indices start at 0 and go up to n-1?\",\n    \"How would you structure your code to correctly count and output the total number of local extrema found in the array?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A local minimum is an element that is strictly less than both its neighbors. A local maximum is an element that is strictly greater than both its neighbors.

This ensures I can safely check both neighbors for each element.\",\n    \"I'll use conditional statements within the loop to check if the current element is less than or greater than both its neighbors (a[i-1] and a[i+1]).

Inside the loop, whenever an element meets the conditions to be a local minimum or local maximum, I will increment the counter.
