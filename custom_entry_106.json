The `n-sum` method involves grouping digits into groups of `n` and summing them. The `n-altsum` method involves grouping digits into groups of `n` and alternately adding and subtracting them.\\n- Leveraging Fermat's Little Theorem: Fermat's Little Theorem states that if `p` is a prime number, then for any integer `a` not divisible by `p`, `a^(p-1) \u2261 1 (mod p)`. This theorem can be useful because it relates to the remainders when powers of integers are divided by a prime number.\\n- Finding Divisors of p-1: Because of Fermat's Little Theorem, the problem focuses on finding divisors `d` of `p-1`. The idea is to test whether `10^d mod p` is equal to 1 (for `n-sum`) or `p-1` (for `n-altsum`).\\n- Testing for n-sum and n-altsum: Iterate through the divisors `d` of `p-1`. For each `d`, compute `10^d mod p`. If the result is 1, then the prime can be tested using the `d-sum` method. If the result is `p-1`, then the prime can be tested using the `d-altsum` method.\\n- Returning the smallest n: As soon as the smallest divisor `d` that satisfies either the `n-sum` or `n-altsum` condition is found, return the result as a string formatted as either '{}-sum' or '{}-altsum'.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Can you explain the difference between 'n-sum' and 'n-altsum' divisibility tests?\",\n    \"How does Fermat's Little Theorem relate to this problem, and why are we looking at divisors of p-1?\",\n    \"What is the significance of calculating `10^d mod p`?\",\n    \"Why do we need to find the smallest divisor `d` of `p-1`?\",\n    \"How do you efficiently compute `10^d mod p` in Python?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"'n-sum' involves grouping digits into groups of `n` and summing them.

We are looking at divisors of `p-1` because if `10^d \u2261 1 (mod p)` for some divisor `d` of `p-1`, then the number is divisible by p if the sum of its digits grouped into `d` is divisible by p.
