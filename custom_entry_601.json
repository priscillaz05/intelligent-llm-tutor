He doesn't have enough work forces for all the deliveries.  For this he has came up with an idea - he will group together all those orders which have to be delivered in nearby areas. \\n\\nIn particular, he has identified certain bidirectional roads which he calls as fast roads. They are short and usually traffic free, so the fast travel is possible along these roads. His plan is that he will send orders to locations A and B together if and only if it is possible to travel between A and B using only fast roads. Your task is, given the configuration of fast roads, identify which orders are to be sent together.\\n\\n-----Input-----\\nFirst line of input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. First line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and M, denoting number of locations and the number of fast roads. Then M lines follow each containing two space separated integers A and B, denoting that there is a fast road between locations A and B. Assume that locations are indexed by numbers from 0 to N-1. \\n\\nNext line contains an integer Q denoting the number of queries. Each of the next Q lines contain two integers X and Y. For each query you have to find out if orders meant for locations X and Y are to be sent together or not.\\n\\nNote that there might be multiple fast roads between same pair of locations, also there might be a fast road that links a location to itself.\\n\\n-----Output-----\\nFor each test case print Q lines - one for each query. Output \\\"YO\\\" if the orders are to be \\ndelivered together and \\\"NO\\\" otherwise (quotes for clarity).\\n\\n-----Constraints-----\\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 100\\n1 \u2264 M \u2264 1000\\n0 \u2264 A, B, X, Y \u2264 N-1\\n1 \u2264 Q \u2264 3000\\n\\n-----Example-----\\nInput:\\n1\\n4 2\\n0 1\\n1 2\\n3\\n0 2\\n0 3\\n2 1\\n\\nOutput:\\nYO\\nNO\\nYO\\n\\n-----Warning!-----\\nThere are large input and output files in this problem.

Path compression will flatten the tree structure and union by rank will keep trees relatively balanced, both improving performance.\\n- Implementation Details: Implement functions to find the representative (or root) of a location's set and to merge two sets together if there is a fast road between two locations. Pay attention to using fast I/O techniques to handle the large input/output files.\\n- Query Handling: For each query, check if the two locations belong to the same set.
