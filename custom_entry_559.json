The squares must have integer sides.\\n- Identifying Key Strategies: The problem can be approached using dynamic programming or recursion with memoization, given the overlapping subproblems nature. The recursive approach involves trying different cuts of the rectangle into smaller rectangles.\\n- Optimization Techniques: Memoization (using `lru_cache`) is crucial to avoid redundant calculations, as the same sub-rectangles may be encountered multiple times.\\n- Handling Base Cases and Constraints: Handle the base cases where one dimension is a multiple of the other, and take note of the constraints, specifically the size limit of the rectangle (1 <= n, m <= 13), which indicates the feasibility of a recursive approach with memoization.\\n- Special Case: Account for the special case of a 11x13 (or 13x11) rectangle which requires 6 tiles, as specified in the problem description.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the core objective of this problem, and what defines a valid tiling?\",\n    \"Why might a recursive or dynamic programming strategy be suitable for solving this problem?\",\n    \"How can memoization be used to optimize the solution, and what benefits does it provide?\",\n    \"How should base cases be handled to terminate recursion correctly and provide accurate answers for simple rectangles?\",\n    \"Are there any specific edge cases or known solutions for particular rectangle sizes that should be accounted for directly?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The core objective is to determine the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle completely, where each square must have integer side lengths.\",\n    \"A recursive or dynamic programming strategy is suitable because the problem can be broken down into smaller, overlapping subproblems, like finding the minimum number of squares needed for smaller rectangles formed after an initial cut.\",\n    \"Memoization avoids redundant calculations by storing the results of subproblems. This dramatically improves efficiency, preventing exponential time complexity in the recursive calls.\",\n    \"Base cases should handle when one side is divisible by the other, in which case the result is simply the division (e.g., a 2x4 rectangle needs 2 squares of size 2x2). These cases provide the exit conditions for the recursion.\",\n    \"Yes, for example, a 11x13 or 13x11 rectangle is a special case that needs exactly 6 tiles. It is beneficial to hardcode this known solution for efficiency.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
