For each index, i (1<=i<=N), find the difference between the number of distinct elements in the left and right side in the of the current element in the array. \\nExample 1:\\nInput:\\nN = 3\\narr[] = {4, 3, 3}\\nOutput: {-1, 0, 2}\\nExplanation: For index i=1, there are 0 distinct element in the left side of it, and 1 distinct element(3) in it's right side. So difference is 0-1 = -1. \\nSimilarly for index i=2, there is 1 distinct element (4) in left side of it, and 1 distinct element(3) in it's right side. So difference is 1-1 = 0.\\nSimilarly for index i=3, there are 2 distinct elements (4 and 3) in left side of it, and 0 distinct elements in it's left side. So difference is 2-0 = 2.\\nExample 2:\\nInput:\\nN = 4\\narr[] = {4, 4, 3, 3}\\nOutput: {-2, 0, 0, 2}\\nExplanation: For index i=1, there are 0 distinct element in the left side of it, and 2 distinct element(4 and 3) in it's right side. So difference is 0-2 = -2.\\nSimilarly for index i=2, there is 1 distinct element (4) in left side of it, and 1 distinct element(3) in it's right side.

Arrays to store the count of distinct elements to the left and right.\\n- Algorithm Selection: Use two passes. One pass starts from left to right, recording the number of distinct elements to the left of each element. The second pass starts from right to left, recording the number of distinct elements to the right of each element. Then, compute the difference for each position.\\n- Edge Cases: The left side of the first element and the right side of the last element are empty. An empty side contributes 0 to the difference.\\n- Space Optimization: Ensure space optimization by using additional arrays of size N to store distinct counts from both sides, fulfilling the O(N) space complexity requirement.\\n- Time Optimization: Ensure time complexity is O(N) by using dictionaries for checking distinct elements during each traversal of the array.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you efficiently keep track of distinct elements as you iterate through the array?\",\n    \"What should be the values when the left or right side of an element is empty?\",\n    \"What is the most space efficient way to store the number of distinct elements on both sides?\",\n    \"How would you handle the edge cases at the boundaries of the array?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Use a hash set (dictionary in Python) to store distinct elements.
