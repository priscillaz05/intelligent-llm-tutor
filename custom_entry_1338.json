These are-\\n1. 0->1->2\\n2. 0->3->2\\n \\nYour Task:\\nYou don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function possible_paths() which takes edges, n, s and d as input parameter and returns the number of ways to reach from s to d.\\n \\nExpected Time Compelxity: O(2^{n})\\nExpected Space Complexity: O(n+e) \\nwhere e is the number of edges in the graph.\\n \\nConstraints:\\n1 <= n <= 15\\n0 <= s, d <= n-1\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"class Solution:\\n\\n\\tdef possible_paths(self, edges, n, s, d):\\n\\t\\tg = [[] for _ in range(n)]\\n\\t\\tfor (a, b) in edges:\\n\\t\\t\\tg[a].append(b)\\n\\t\\tpath = set()\\n\\n\\t\\tdef helper(node, prev, p):\\n\\t\\t\\tif node == d:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpath.add(tuple(p + [node]))\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn p\\n\\t\\t\\tif node in p:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn False\\n\\t\\t\\tfor neig in g[node]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif neig != prev:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thelper(neig, node, p + [node])\\n\\t\\t\\treturn p\\n\\t\\thelper(s, -1, [])\\n\\t\\treturn len(path)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the problem: The task is to find the number of distinct paths from a source node 's' to a destination node 'd' in a directed acyclic graph (DAG).\\n- Graph representation: The input 'edges' needs to be converted into a suitable graph representation, such as an adjacency list, to efficiently find neighbors of a given node.\\n- Path finding strategy: A depth-first search (DFS) approach can be used to traverse the graph and explore all possible paths from 's' to 'd'.  A set is used to keep track of distinct paths to avoid duplicates.\\n- Cycle detection: Since the graph is a DAG, there are no cycles, but checking for visited nodes in the current path during DFS is still important to prevent infinite loops and repeated path exploration.\\n- Counting paths:  Each time the destination node 'd' is reached, the current path is added to the set to count it. The final count of paths would be the size of the paths set.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you represent a graph in code, given a list of edges, and why is an adjacency list a suitable choice for this problem?\",\n    \"What approach would you take to find all possible paths from a source node to a destination node in a directed graph, and why is DFS appropriate here?\",\n    \"How can you avoid counting the same path multiple times, and why is it essential to do so for this problem?\",\n    \"What modifications are needed to adopt Depth First Search algorithm to solve this problem?\",\n    \"How do you keep track of the nodes in the current path during DFS to avoid cycles and infinite loops?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A graph can be represented using an adjacency list or an adjacency matrix. An adjacency list, where each node maps to a list of its neighbors, is more efficient for sparse graphs because it only stores the actual connections, saving memory and computation time compared to the adjacency matrix.\",\n    \"A depth-first search (DFS) can be used to traverse the graph, exploring each branch as far as possible before backtracking. DFS is appropriate here because it allows us to systematically explore all possible paths from the source to the destination.\",\n    \"To avoid counting the same path multiple times, you can use a set to store the paths, and ensure each path is uniquely represented (e.g., as a tuple).\",\n    \"We will adopt Depth First Search to this problem by creating a recursive helper function to perform DFS. The helper function keeps track of the current node, the nodes already visited in the current path, and the destination node. Each time the destination node is reached, we add the current path to the count. \",\n    \"As you traverse the graph, keep track of the current nodes in the path so you can avoid cycles and prevent infinite loops.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
