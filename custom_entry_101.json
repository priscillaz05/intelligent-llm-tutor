As a birthday gift he received two strings A and B. Now he is curious if there is a way to insert string B into string A so that the resulting string is a palindrome. You agreed to help him and even tell how many different variants of such insertions exist. Two variants are considered different if string B is inserted in different places. Print the number of possible insertion variants.\\n\\nInput:-\\n1st line input the number of testcases and next two lines of each test case contains A and B. \\n\\nOutput:- \\nPrint the number of variants.\\n\\nSAMPLE INPUT\\n1\\naba\\nb\\n\\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\\n2\\n\\nExplanation\\n\\nYou can insert B in 4 different places:\\nBefore the first letter of A. The result is \\\"baba\\\" and it is not a\\n   palindrome.\\nAfter the first letter 'a'. The result is \\\"abba\\\" and it is a\\n   palindrome.\\nAfter the letter 'b'.The result is \\\"abba\\\" and it is also a\\n   palindrome.\\nAfter the second letter 'a'. The result is \\\"abab\\\" and it is not a\\n   palindrome.\\n\\nSo, the answer for this testcase is 2.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"t = int(eval(input()))\\nwhile(t>0):\\n\\ta = input()\\n\\tb = input()\\n\\tc = 0\\n\\tfor i in range(0,len(a)+1):\\n\\t\\tk=a\\n\\t\\tk = k[:i] + b + k[i:]\\n\\t\\tif(k==k[::-1]):\\n\\t\\t\\tc+=1\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tcontinue\\n\\tprint(c)\\n\\tt-=1\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem Requirements: The task is to find all possible positions to insert string B into string A such that the resulting string is a palindrome. Count the number of such valid positions.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Consider edge cases such as empty strings for A or B. Note that the insertion point can be before the first character, after the last character, or in between any two characters of string A.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Iterate through all possible insertion points. For each point, insert B into A, and then check if the resulting string is a palindrome. If it is, increment the count. Return the final count.\\n- Implementing Insertion and Palindrome Check: Create a new string by inserting B into A at each possible position. Use string slicing to achieve this efficiently. Implement a palindrome check function to determine if a string is the same when read forward and backward.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for a string to be a palindrome, and how can we check if a given string is a palindrome?\",\n    \"How can we systematically iterate through all possible insertion points of string B into string A?\",\n    \"When inserting string B into string A at a given position, how do we construct the new string efficiently?\",\n    \"What edge cases should be considered, such as empty strings, and how should they be handled?\",\n    \"How can the total count of valid insertion variants be maintained and returned?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A string is a palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward. We can check if a string is a palindrome by comparing it to its reversed version, which can be obtained using slicing (string[::-1]).\",\n    \"We can iterate through all possible insertion points using a loop that runs from 0 to the length of string A inclusive. Each index represents the position *before* which string B will be inserted into A.\",\n    \"We can construct the new string by slicing string A into two parts at the insertion point and concatenating the first part, string B, and the second part. If A = 'example' and insertion index is 2, and B = 'XYZ', then the new string would be A[:2] + B + A[2:], which is 'exXYZample'.\",\n    \"If either A or B is an empty string, the algorithm should still function correctly. If A is empty, we need to check if B itself is a palindrome. We should also consider cases with very long strings to avoid excessive memory usage.\",\n    \"Initialize a counter to 0. For each valid insertion point that results in a palindrome, increment the counter. After iterating through all possible insertion points, return the final count.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
