So, instead of storing a key, he decided to store a fingerprint of a key. However, using some existing fingerprint algorithm looked too boring to him, so he invented his own one.\\n\\nKarl's fingerprint is calculated by the following process: divide the given integer by 2, then divide the result by 3, then divide the result by 4, and so on, until we get a result that equals zero (we are speaking about integer division each time). The fingerprint is defined as the multiset of the remainders of these divisions. \\n\\nFor example, this is how Karl's fingerprint algorithm is applied to the key 11: 11 divided by 2 has remainder 1 and result 5, then 5 divided by 3 has remainder 2 and result 1, and 1 divided by 4 has remainder 1 and result 0. Thus, the key 11 produces the sequence of remainders [1, 2, 1] and has the fingerprint multiset \\\\{1, 1, 2\\\\}.\\n\\nKsenia wants to prove that Karl's fingerprint algorithm is not very good. For example, she found that both keys 178800 and 123456 produce the fingerprint of \\\\{0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 4\\\\}. Thus, users are at risk of fingerprint collision with some commonly used and easy to guess keys like 123456.\\n\\nKsenia wants to make her words more persuasive. She wants to calculate the number of other keys that have the same fingerprint as the keys in the given list of some commonly used keys. Your task is to help her.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 50 000) \u2014 the number of commonly used keys to examine. Each of the next t lines contains one integer k_i (1 \u2264 k_i \u2264 10^{18}) \u2014 the key itself. \\n\\nOutput\\n\\nFor each of the keys print one integer \u2014 the number of other keys that have the same fingerprint. \\n\\nExample\\n\\nInput\\n\\n\\n3\\n1\\n11\\n123456\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n\\n0\\n1\\n127\\n\\nNote\\n\\nThe other key with the same fingerprint as 11 is 15. 15 produces a sequence of remainders [1, 1, 2]. So both numbers have the fingerprint multiset \\\\{1, 1, 2\\\\}.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import math as m\\nimport collections\\nIP = lambda : list(map(int, input().split()))\\nINF = 1000000000.0\\nf = [1]\\nfor i in range(1, 22):\\n\\tf.append(f[-1] * i)\\n\\ndef solve(arr, n):\\n\\td = collections.Counter(arr)\\n\\ttu = 1\\n\\tmau = 1\\n\\ta = [0] * 22\\n\\tfor i in arr:\\n\\t\\ta[i] += 1\\n\\tfor i in range(1, len(a)):\\n\\t\\ta[i] += a[i - 1]\\n\\tfor i in range(2, n + 2):\\n\\t\\ttu *= a[i - 1] - i + 2\\n\\tfor i in d.values():\\n\\t\\tmau *= f[i]\\n\\treturn tu // mau\\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\\n\\tn = IP()[0]\\n\\tarr = []\\n\\ti = 2\\n\\twhile n:\\n\\t\\tarr.append(n % i)\\n\\t\\tn //= i\\n\\t\\ti += 1\\n\\tarr.sort()\\n\\tpro = solve(arr, len(arr))\\n\\tif 0 in arr:\\n\\t\\tarr.pop(0)\\n\\t\\ttru = solve(arr, len(arr))\\n\\t\\tpro -= tru\\n\\tprint(pro - 1)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the fingerprinting process: The core of the problem is to understand Karl's fingerprinting algorithm. This involves repeatedly dividing the input number by an increasing sequence of integers (2, 3, 4, ...), collecting the remainders, and treating these remainders as a multiset.\\n- Devising a counting strategy: The challenge is to find other numbers that result in the same fingerprint. Since the process involves integer division and remainders, the problem boils down to finding numbers that yield the same sequence of remainders when divided successively by 2, 3, 4, and so on.\\n- Handling the multiset property: Recognize that the order of remainders does not matter, only the counts of each remainder value. This suggests a combinatorial approach, specifically calculating the number of permutations of the remainders.\\n- Addressing the 'other keys' constraint: Ensure that the original key is excluded from the count of keys with the same fingerprint. The problem asks for *other* keys.\\n- Optimizing for large inputs: The input key can be up to 10^18. The number of divisions required before the result reaches zero will be relatively small. Factorials for combinatorics will be computed but their number of terms will remain relatively small, i.e. we can safely precompute factorials up to 21.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does Karl's fingerprint algorithm transform a given key into a fingerprint multiset?\",\n    \"If two numbers have the same fingerprint, what can you infer about their remainders when divided successively by 2, 3, 4, and so on?\",\n    \"Given a multiset of remainders, how can you determine the number of different keys that would produce that same multiset as their fingerprint?\",\n    \"How do you deal with the fact that the fingerprint is a multiset and not an ordered list?\",\n    \"What steps must be taken to ensure that you are only counting *other* keys that share the same fingerprint, excluding the given key?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Karl's algorithm involves repeatedly dividing the key by an increasing sequence of integers (2, 3, 4, ...), collecting the remainders of these divisions, and representing them as a multiset.\",\n    \"If two numbers have the same fingerprint, it means that the multiset of their remainders when divided by 2, 3, 4, and so on, is the same, although the numbers themselves may be different.\",\n    \"You can calculate the number of different keys by considering the number of ways you can permute the sequence of remainders.
