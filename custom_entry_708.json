Instead of incrementing each element within the range, only the start and end+1 indices are modified.\",\n    \"Adding the increment value k at index a[i] signifies the start of the increment range, while subtracting k at index b[i] + 1 signifies the end of the increment range. This ensures that the effect of the increment is contained within the specified range when the prefix sum is calculated.\",\n    \"The prefix sum array is the reconstructed array after applying all the range increments. Calculating the prefix sum of the difference array effectively simulates the cumulative effect of each range increment operation on the original array.\",\n    \"Creating an array of size N+1 allows us to handle the case where b[i] can be N-1, and we need to decrement the value at b[i] + 1. By creating N+1 sized array, we can avoid out-of-bounds error.\",\n    \"One important edge case is ensuring that indices a[i] and b[i] are within the bounds of the array. Other important edge cases include when N is 0 or M is 0, which should return 0 immediately.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
