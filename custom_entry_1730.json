The objective is to find this unique number.\\n- Handling Constraints: The solution needs to be efficient with a time complexity of O(log N) and a space complexity of O(1). This suggests the use of a binary search algorithm.\\n- Developing a Binary Search Strategy: Adapt binary search to identify the single, non-duplicated element. Consider how to adjust the search space based on whether the middle element is part of a pair or is the single element. Think about how the indices of duplicate pairs can help refine the search.\\n- Edge Case Considerations: Consider edge cases like an array with only one element or an array where the single element is at the beginning or end.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the key properties of the input array that can guide the choice of algorithm?\",\n    \"How can binary search be adapted to find a single non-duplicated element in an array of paired elements?\",\n    \"How would you determine if the element at the middle index is part of a pair or if it's the unique element?\",\n    \"How should the search space be adjusted if the middle element is part of a pair?\",\n    \"What are some edge cases to consider, and how would they affect your solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The array is sorted, and all elements except one occur exactly twice. These properties suggest a binary search approach for efficiency.\",\n    \"Binary search can be used to repeatedly halve the search interval. By checking if the middle element is part of a pair, the half containing the single element can be chosen for the next iteration.\",\n    \"If the middle element's index is even and it's equal to the next element, or if the middle element's index is odd and it's equal to the previous element, then the middle element is part of a pair. Otherwise, it's the unique element or in the half containing the unique element.\",\n    \"If the middle element is part of a pair, the search space should be adjusted to the half that doesn't include the pair. If the index is even, discard the middle element and the next one; if the index is odd, discard the middle element and the previous one.\",\n    \"Edge cases include an array with a single element (which is the answer), or the single element being at the start or end of the array. These cases need special handling during the binary search to ensure correct indices are considered.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
