You, the chef, are in a soup.  There are N knights, including King Arthur, each with a different preference for dessert, but you cannot afford to make desserts for all of them.\\n\\nYou are given the cost of manufacturing each Knight's preferred dessert\u2013since it is a round table, the list starts with the cost of King Arthur's dessert, and goes counter-clockwise.\\n\\nYou decide to pick the cheapest desserts to make, such that for every pair of adjacent Knights, at least one gets his dessert. This will ensure that the Knights do not protest.<p>A strange feature of the Knights is that they will not complain about not getting dessert unless they get support from both their neighbours.  So, you decide to pick the cheapest desserts to make, such that for every pair of adjacent Knights, at least one gets his dessert.</p>\\n\\nWhat is the minimum cost of tonight's dinner, given this condition?\\n\\nFor instance, suppose there are 5 Knights and their desserts cost 1, 2, 1, 2 and 2.  In this case, the minimum cost is 4, which you can achieve by feeding the first, third and fourth (or fifth) Knights.  \\n\\n-----Input format-----\\nThere are 2 lines of input.  The first line contains a single integer N, the number of seats at the table. The next line contains N space separated integers, each being the cost of the dessert of a Knight, listed in counterclockwise order around the table, starting with King Arthur.\\n\\n-----Output format-----\\nThe output should be a single line containing a single integer, the minimum possible cost for you, the chef.\\n\\n-----Testdata-----\\nEach Knight's dessert costs strictly more than 0 and strictly less than 1000.  You may assume that 1 \u2264 N \u2264 106.  In 30% of the test cases, 1 \u2264 N \u2264 103.\\n\\n- Subtask 1 (30 marks)\\n- Subtask 2 (70 marks)\\n\\n-----Sample Input-----\\n5\\n1 2 1 2 2\\n\\n-----Sample Output-----\\n4\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"n = int(input())\\nar = list(map(int, input().split()))\\ndp = [0] * n\\ndp[0] = ar[0]\\ndp[1] = ar[1]\\nfor i in range(2, n):\\n\\tdp[i] = min(dp[i - 2], dp[i - 1]) + ar[i]\\nar.reverse()\\ndp1 = [0] * n\\ndp1[0] = ar[0]\\ndp1[1] = ar[1]\\nfor i in range(2, n):\\n\\tdp1[i] = min(dp1[i - 2], dp1[i - 1]) + ar[i]\\nprint(min(dp[-1], dp1[-1]))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: Recognize that the goal is to minimize the cost of desserts while ensuring no adjacent knights are both without dessert.\\n- Dynamic Programming Approach: Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem. The state dp[i] can represent the minimum cost to feed the first i knights such that no two adjacent knights are unserved.\\n- Handling Circular Arrangement: Realize that the round table arrangement introduces a constraint: The first and last knights are also adjacent. Consider starting dynamic programming from different points to account for this circularity.\\n- Edge Cases and Constraints: Note the constraints (1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^6) and that each dessert cost is between 1 and 1000. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned other than inherent constraints of the problem.\\n- Optimizing the Solution: Determine if the problem can be optimized in terms of space or time complexity, considering the constraints.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean to satisfy the condition that 'for every pair of adjacent Knights, at least one gets his dessert'?\",\n    \"Why is dynamic programming suitable for this problem, and how would you define the state in a dynamic programming solution?\",\n    \"How would you handle the circular arrangement of the knights at the Round Table in your algorithm?\",\n    \"What are the base cases for the dynamic programming solution, and how do they initialize the process?\",\n    \"How does the algorithm account for the dependency between serving or not serving adjacent knights?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"It means that if we consider any two knights sitting next to each other, at least one of them must receive their preferred dessert.\",\n    \"Dynamic programming is suitable because the optimal solution for the first i knights can be built from the optimal solutions for smaller subproblems (i.e., the first i-1 or i-2 knights). The state dp[i] can represent the minimum cost to feed the first i knights such that no two adjacent knights are unserved.\",\n    \"To handle the circular arrangement, you can run the dynamic programming solution twice, once including King Arthur's dessert in the selection and once excluding it. Then, you can choose the minimum of the two results.\",\n    \"The base cases for the dynamic programming solution are: dp[0] = cost of the first knight's dessert, and dp[1] = cost of the second knight's dessert. This initializes the costs for the first one or two knights.\",\n    \"The algorithm accounts for the dependency by considering two choices for each knight: either serve the knight's dessert or don't. If you choose to serve the knight, you add the dessert cost to the minimum cost of the previous subproblem. If you don't serve the knight, the previous knight must have been served, affecting the computation of the minimum cost.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
