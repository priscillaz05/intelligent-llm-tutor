Understand the need to calculate the total distance traveled during the running periods within the given total time.\\n- Decomposing the Total Time: Divide the total time into complete cycles of running and resting, and a possible remaining partial cycle. Calculate the number of full cycles and the remaining time.\\n- Calculating Distance in Full Cycles: Multiply the number of full cycles by the running time to find the total running time in full cycles. Then, multiply this time by the speed to get the distance traveled in full cycles.\\n- Handling the Remaining Time: If there's remaining time, determine if it's enough for the horse to run for the entire 'runTime', or only a portion of it. Calculate the distance traveled during this partial cycle.\\n- Combining the Results: Sum the distance traveled in full cycles and the distance traveled in the remaining time to get the total distance traveled.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you determine the number of complete run/rest cycles within the total time?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: I can use integer division to divide the total time by the sum of the run time and rest time. This will give me the number of complete cycles.\",\n    \"How do you handle the remaining time after accounting for complete run/rest cycles?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: The remainder of the division gives the remaining time. If the remaining time is less than or equal to the run time, the horse runs for that remaining time. If the remaining time is greater than the run time, the horse runs for the full run time and then rests.\",\n    \"How do you calculate the distance traveled during both the full cycles and any remaining time?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: For full cycles, I multiply the number of cycles by the run time and then by the speed. For the remaining time, I take the minimum of the remaining time and run time, and then multiply by the speed. Finally, sum these two values.\",\n    \"What are the units of the input variables, and how do they affect the output?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: totalTime, runTime, and restTime are in seconds, and speed is in meters per second. The output will be in meters, representing the total distance traveled.\",\n    \"What edge cases or constraints should you consider in this problem?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: Consider the case where totalTime is less than runTime.
