A key detail is that k must be adjusted based on whether the length of S is a power of 2.\\n- Handling Edge Cases and Constraints: Consider the constraints on the length of S and k. Determine what to return if it's impossible to remove k characters or if the resulting string would be empty (return -1).\\n- Algorithm Selection and Implementation: A greedy approach involving a stack/deque is suitable for this problem. The core idea is to maintain a stack of characters that constructs the result. For each character in the input string, compare it with the top of the stack and remove larger characters from the stack if k > 0. Remember to handle the k adjustment based on the length of the string being a power of 2.\\n- Correcting k value: Before proceeding to create the minimal string, we must correct the value of k depending on if the length of the input string, S, is a power of 2. If it is, k = k // 2, else k = k * 2.\\n- In-Place Modification and Optimization: Try to make the algorithm as efficient as possible, considering time and space constraints. Use a stack or deque to efficiently manage the characters for the result string.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does the length of the input string influence the number of characters to remove, and how can you determine if the string length is a power of 2?\",\n    \"What edge cases should be handled, and what return value should be used for these cases?\",\n    \"Can you explain the core idea of the greedy approach using a stack/deque to find the lexicographically smallest string after removing characters?\",\n    \"How does the stack-based approach help in maintaining the lexicographically smallest string as you iterate through the input?\",\n    \"After removing k characters how would you return the resulting string from the stack/deque?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"If the length of the input string is a power of 2, k is halved (k = k // 2); otherwise, k is doubled (k = k * 2). To determine if the length is a power of 2, you can use the bitwise AND trick: n & (n - 1) == 0. Where n is the length of the input string.\",\n    \"Edge cases include when k is greater than or equal to the length of the string after k has been corrected, in which case it's impossible to remove the required number of characters and an empty string cannot be returned. The problem statement specifies returning -1.\",\n    \"The greedy approach uses a stack (or deque) to build the result string. For each character in the input string, it checks if the current character is smaller than the top of the stack. If it is, and we still have characters to remove (k > 0), pop the larger character from the stack and decrement k. The goal is to ensure that the stack always contains the smallest possible characters in the correct order.\",\n    \"The stack helps maintain the lexicographically smallest string by always comparing the current character with the top of the stack and removing larger characters to make room for smaller ones. This ensures that at each step, the characters in the stack form the smallest possible prefix of the final string.\",\n    \"If after processing the entire input string there are remaining characters to remove from the stack, remove them from the top of the stack. Then, convert the stack (deque) to a string. If using a stack, you would typically pop elements from the stack and prepend them to form the answer string, as stacks work LIFO (Last In First Out). If using deque you would remove elements from the left of the deque.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
