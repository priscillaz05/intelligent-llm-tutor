This implies trying to make d_i close to n - i.\\n- Constructing a Permutation:  When n is even, place each i at x_i and y_i such that y_i - x_i = d_i. Alternate the even and odd numbers. When n is odd, placing n in the middle may help to reduce the sum.\\n- Handling Even and Odd n:  Use different permutation strategies based on whether n is even or odd, placing elements to attempt to make `d_i` approximately equal to `n - i`.\\n- Implementation Details: Account for the duplication of each number (1 to n each appears twice).\\n\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the core objective of the problem?\",\n    \"How is the distance d_i defined, and what role does it play?\",\n    \"What values of d_i are ideal to minimize the value of the given sum?\",\n    \"How does the parity of n (even or odd) affect the permutation strategy?\",\n    \"How can the need to place each number twice be satisfied effectively?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The objective is to permute the array 'a' to minimize the sum  s = \u2211(n - i) * |d_i + i - n|, where d_i is the distance between the two positions of number i.\",\n    \"d_i is the distance between the two positions of number i in the permuted array a, specifically d_i = y_i - x_i, where x_i and y_i are the positions of number i with x_i < y_i.\",\n    \"Ideally, we want d_i to be close to n - i to minimize |d_i + i - n| for each i.\",\n    \"The parity of n affects how the numbers are arranged to minimize the sum.
