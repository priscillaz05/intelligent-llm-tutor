But anvils do so most of all.\\n\\nAnvils come in different sizes and shapes. Quite often they get the hero stuck deep in the ground. But have you ever thought who throws anvils from the sky? From what height? We are sure that such questions have never troubled you!\\n\\nIt turns out that throwing an anvil properly is not an easy task at all. Let's describe one of the most popular anvil throwing models.\\n\\nLet the height p of the potential victim vary in the range [0;a] and the direction of the wind q vary in the range [ - b;b]. p and q could be any real (floating) numbers. Then we can assume that the anvil will fit the toon's head perfectly only if the following equation has at least one real root: \\n\\n<image>\\n\\nDetermine the probability with which an aim can be successfully hit by an anvil.\\n\\nYou can assume that the p and q coefficients are chosen equiprobably and independently in their ranges.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line contains integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10000) \u2014 amount of testcases.\\n\\nEach of the following t lines contain two space-separated integers a and b (0 \u2264 a, b \u2264 106).\\n\\nPretests contain all the tests with 0 < a < 10, 0 \u2264 b < 10.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nPrint t lines \u2014 the probability of a successful anvil hit for each testcase.

The hit is successful if the equation p*x^2 + q*x + 1 = 0 has at least one real root.\\n- Recalling Root Condition: The condition for a quadratic equation to have real roots is that its discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) must be greater than or equal to 0. In this case, the discriminant is q^2 - 4*p*1 >= 0, or q^2 >= 4p, or p <= q^2 / 4.\\n- Geometric Interpretation: We can think of p and q as coordinates. Since p ranges from 0 to a and q ranges from -b to b, we're considering a rectangle in the p-q plane. The area where p <= q^2 / 4 represents successful hits.\\n- Integration for Area: The probability is the ratio of the area under the curve p = q^2 / 4 within the rectangle to the total area of the rectangle (which is a * 2b = 2ab).\\n- Case Analysis:  Consider cases where a is very small, a is very large relative to b, or b is very small, to simplify the calculations and prevent division by zero errors.\\n- Integral Calculation: Integrate the curve p=q^2/4 from -b to b which translates to integral of q^2/4 dq from -b to b which is [q^3/12](from -b to b) which gives (b^3/12 - (-b)^3/12) = b^3/6. The total area is 2*a*b.\\n- Probability Calculation: The probability is therefore (b^3/6) / (2ab) = b^2 / 12a when a > b^2/4 and (Integral from -b to b (q^2/4)dq)/ (2ab) = (b^3/6)/(2ab) = b^2/(12a) and probability = (2ab - Integral from -b to b (a-q^2/4)dq)/2ab if  a < b^2/4.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do we relate the quadratic equation's roots to the success of an anvil hit?\",\n    \"What geometric representation can simplify the probability calculation?\",\n    \"How do we calculate the area within the rectangle where the hit is successful?\",\n    \"How does the relative size of 'a' and 'b' affect the calculation, and what case analysis should we consider?\",\n    \"How do we calculate the overall probability of the anvil successfully hitting the target?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The quadratic equation must have at least one real root for a successful hit. The roots are real if the discriminant (q^2 - 4p) is greater than or equal to 0.\",\n    \"We can think of p and q as coordinates.  Since p ranges from 0 to a and q ranges from -b to b, we're considering a rectangle in the p-q plane. The area where p <= q^2 / 4 represents successful hits.\",\n    \"The area where the hit is successful can be found by integrating q^2/4 with respect to q from -b to b, and this is bounded by max(a, q^2/4) from -b to b.\",\n    \"If 'a' is much greater than b^2/4, the area where hits are successful is limited by q^2/4, whereas if 'a' is smaller than or equal to b^2/4, the entire area under the curve p = q^2/4 within the rectangle counts as successful. When a approaches 0, the probability approaches either 0.5 or 1 depending on if b also approaches 0.  The relation between a and b needs to be handled in different cases.\",\n    \"The probability is the ratio of the successful area to the total area (2ab). Different cases depending on a and b ratio are: (b^3/6) / (2ab) = b^2 / 12a when a > b^2/4, and 1 - (Integral from -b to b (a-q^2/4)dq)/2ab if  a < b^2/4\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
