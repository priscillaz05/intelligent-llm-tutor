The array is always valid, with at least two letters, and all letters are in the same case (either all uppercase or all lowercase).\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Consider the ASCII values of characters and how they increment for consecutive letters. Recognize that looping until a mismatch is found is a viable approach.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Iterate through the array and check if the difference between the ASCII values of consecutive letters is 1. If not, determine the missing letter by finding the character whose ASCII value is one greater than the current letter.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Convert the current letter to its ASCII value using `ord()`, add 1, and then convert back to a character using `chr()` to find the missing letter.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for the input array to contain 'consecutive' letters, and how does this constraint simplify the search for the missing letter?\",\n    \"What considerations should be made for the fact that the input letters can be either uppercase or lowercase, and how might this affect the implementation?\",\n    \"Can you describe a method to use ASCII values to identify the gap between the letters?\",\n    \"When the array is processed, what is the condition for determining whether a letter is missing?\",\n    \"How do you ensure the returned letter matches the case of the input letters?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Consecutive letters mean that the ASCII values of adjacent letters should differ by exactly 1. This allows for a direct comparison of ordinal values to find gaps.\",\n    \"The case must be preserved for the missing letter, but the implementation does not depend on whether it's uppercase or lowercase since the ordinal difference remains the same. The function works regardless of the case of the input letters.\",\n    \"By converting each letter to its ASCII value using `ord()` and checking if the difference between consecutive characters is 1, we can identify missing letters.\",\n    \"A letter is missing when the difference between the ASCII values of consecutive letters is not 1. This implies that there's a skipped letter in the sequence.\",\n    \"Because the missing letter should be the one that comes in sequence, we only need to convert the character before the missing letter to ordinal value, increment by one and convert it back to a character.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
