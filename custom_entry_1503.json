The numbers are padded with leading zeroes to have length $n$.\\n- Defining a Block: A block of length $i$ is a segment of $i$ consecutive digits of the same value that cannot be extended to the left or right.\\n- Counting Blocks of Length $i$: The core task is to count the number of blocks of length $i$ for each $i$ from $1$ to $n$.\\n- Handling Modulo: Since the counts can be very large, take the modulo $998244353$ at each step of the calculation.\\n- Deriving the Formula: For $i < n$, we calculate the number of blocks of length $i$. We consider the possible values of the block and positions. First, consider the case where the block is not at the start or end. There are 10 choices for the digit in the block. The digit before and after the block must be different. There are $n-i-1$ positions. Then the remaining numbers can be anything. The counts for blocks at the ends need to be considered differently. The final block has length n, which is simply 10 (000...0 to 999...9).\\n- Optimizing Calculations: Precompute powers of 10 modulo $998244353$ to speed up calculations.\\n\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you define a 'block' in the context of this problem, and what are its key characteristics?\",\n    \"For a block of length $i$ where $1 <= i < n$, what are the possible scenarios for its position within the n-digit number?\",\n    \"How do you account for the constraint that the block cannot be extended to the left or right?\",\n    \"How does the length of the integer $n$ affect the calculations and the final counts of the blocks?\",\n    \"Why is it important to perform modulo operations, and how does it help to prevent integer overflow issues?\",\n    \"How does the precomputation of the powers of 10 help in the calculation of the final result, and what is its space complexity?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A block is a consecutive segment of equal digits within a number that cannot be extended on either side. Key characteristics are its length and the value of the digit forming the block.\",\n    \"The block can be at the beginning, at the end, or somewhere in the middle of the n-digit number. We must consider all these scenarios in our counting process.\",\n    \"The digits immediately to the left and right of the block must be different from the digit forming the block. This constraint reduces the possible number of combinations when calculating the count.\",\n    \"The length n determines the maximum possible length of a block, and also influences the number of positions where a block of a given length can exist within the integer.\",\n    \"Modulo operations are important to prevent integer overflow because the number of blocks can become very large. Taking the modulo at each step ensures that intermediate results stay within manageable bounds.\",\n    \"Precomputing the powers of 10 helps to quickly calculate values involving $10^k$ modulo $998244353$.
