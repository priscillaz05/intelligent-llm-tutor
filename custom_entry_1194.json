Understand that we need to find the longest path from a source node to all other nodes.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: The graph is acyclic. The weights can be negative. Initialization of distances is important to get the longest path.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Realize that we can use topological sort and then relax the distances from source node.\\n- Implementing In-Place Modification: We need to consider edge cases where nodes are unreachable from the source and assign them INF.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you find the longest path in a DAG with potentially negative weights?\",\n    \"How does topological sort help in solving this problem?\",\n    \"How do you handle the case where a node is unreachable from the source?\",\n    \"Why can't Dijkstra's algorithm be used if there are negative weights present?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"First, perform a topological sort of the DAG. Then, initialize distances to all nodes as negative infinity, except for the source node, which is initialized to 0. Iterate through the topologically sorted nodes and update the distance to each neighbor by adding the edge weight to the current node's distance, if the new distance is greater than the current distance to the neighbor.\",\n    \"Topological sort provides an ordering of nodes that ensures we process nodes in such a way that we always update the distances to nodes that depend on previously visited nodes, allowing us to find the longest path in a single traversal.\",\n    \"If after the algorithm completes, a node's distance is still negative infinity, then that node is unreachable from the source. In the output we need to assign INF to such nodes.\",\n    \"Dijkstra's algorithm is not suitable for graphs with negative edge weights because it assumes that once a node is visited, its shortest path is finalized. Negative weights can cause re-relaxation of previously visited nodes, leading to incorrect results. Since this is a DAG, we can use topological sort to avoid cycles.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
