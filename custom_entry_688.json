The priorities are value, weight, type, date, and name, in that order.\\n- Data Input and Storage: The program should read the number of items $n$ and then read the attributes for each item. A suitable data structure (like a list of tuples) is needed to store the items and their attributes.\\n- Sorting Logic: The built-in `sort()` method or `sorted()` function in Python can be used to sort the list of tuples. The sorting will automatically follow the order of elements within the tuple, which matches the specified priorities.\\n- Output: The sorted list of items needs to be printed to the console, with attributes separated by spaces and each item on a new line.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How should the input data be structured to facilitate sorting based on multiple criteria?\",\n    \"What built-in functions in Python can be used for sorting, and how can they be applied to a list of tuples?\",\n    \"How can the output be formatted to meet the specified requirements (attributes separated by spaces, each item on a new line)?\",\n    \"What data types should be used to store the value, weight, type, date, and name attributes to ensure correct sorting?\",\n    \"What edge cases might be relevant in this problem and what steps can be taken to ensure the program handles them correctly?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The input data should be stored as a list of tuples, where each tuple represents an item and contains its attributes in the order of sorting priority (value, weight, type, date, name).\",\n    \"The `sort()` method or the `sorted()` function can be used. Since tuples are compared element-wise, the list of tuples will be sorted based on the defined priorities.\",\n    \"The `print(*item)` syntax can be used within a loop to print the attributes of each item separated by spaces. Each item is printed on a new line by default.\",\n    \"Value, weight, and date should be stored as integers. Type should be stored as a string (upper-case letter). Name should be stored as a string. Converting the numeric attributes to integers ensures correct numerical sorting.\",\n    \"The constraints on $n$, $v_i$, $w_i$, and $d_i$ should be considered. Also, ensure the input is read correctly and the data types are handled properly. Check to handle edge cases like empty input or potentially invalid characters in the input strings.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
