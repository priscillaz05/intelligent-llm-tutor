Example: $\\\\text{reverse()abc''})=\\\\text{\\\"cba''}$ \\n\\nb. $shuffle(A)$ denotes any string that's a permutation of string $\\\\mbox{A}$. Example: $\\\\textsf{shuffle(\\\"good^n)}\\\\:\\\\in\\\\:\\\\:['\\\\textsf{good'}',\\\\:\\\\:'\\\\textsf{gdo'}',\\\\:\\\\:\\\\textsf{'cgd'}',\\\\:\\\\:\\\\textsf{'oddg'}',\\\\:\\\\:\\\\textsf{'dgo'}',\\\\:\\\\:\\\\textsf{'dog'}]$ \\n\\nc. $\\\\textit{merge}(A1,A2)$ denotes any string that's obtained by interspersing the two strings $A\\\\mathbf{1}$ & $A2$, maintaining the order of characters in both. For example, $\\\\textbf{A1}=\\\\textbf{\\\"abc''}$ & $\\\\textbf{A2}=\\\\textbf{\\\"def\\\"}$, one possible result of $\\\\textit{merge}(A1,A2)$ could be $\\\\textbf{\\\"abcdef\\\"}$, another could be $\\\\textbf{\\\"abdef\\\"}$, another could be $\\\\textbf{\\\"adbecf\\\"}$ and so on.  \\n\\nGiven a string $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mathrm{~S~}}$ such that $\\\\textbf{s}\\\\in\\\\textbf{merge(reverse(A)},\\\\:\\\\textbf{shuffle(A)})$ for some string $\\\\mbox{A}$, find the lexicographically smallest $\\\\mbox{A}$.\\n\\nFor example, $s=a b a b$.  We can split it into two strings of $\\\\boldsymbol{ab}$.  The reverse is $\\\\textbf{ba}$ and we need to find a string to shuffle in to get $\\\\boldsymbol{abab}$.  The middle two characters match our reverse string, leaving the $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}$ and $\\\\boldsymbol{b}$ at the ends.  Our shuffle string needs to be $\\\\boldsymbol{ab}$.  Lexicographically $ab<ba$, so our answer is $\\\\boldsymbol{ab}$.  \\n\\nFunction Description\\n\\nComplete the reverseShuffleMerge function in the editor below.

We want to find the smallest A, so we should greedily pick characters from the right of S.\\n- Developing the algorithm: We first compute the counts of each character in S. Then we halve these counts to determine the counts of each character in A.  Then, starting from the end of S, we greedily pick the smallest character to add to A if that character is still required.  Keep track of used character and skipped characters as we traverse the string from right to left, and only add a character to the result if adding it would lead to a valid reverseShuffleMerge string.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for a string S to be a merge of reverse(A) and shuffle(A)?\",\n    \"Given the definition of S, what can you say about the frequency of each character in A versus the frequency of each character in S?\",\n    \"How would you approach constructing A greedily to ensure it's the lexicographically smallest string?\",\n    \"How would you efficiently keep track of which characters you've used when constructing A, and how does that affect your decision-making process?\",\n    \"How can you ensure that the string you are building, say A, is valid, or in other words, will result in the complete reverseShuffleMerge?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"It means that S can be formed by interleaving reverse(A) and a permutation of A, while preserving the relative order of characters within each of reverse(A) and shuffle(A).\",\n    \"The frequency of each character in A is exactly half the frequency of the corresponding character in S.\",\n    \"Start from the end of S and greedily choose the smallest character that satisfies the requirements, ensuring you have enough of each character left to form the reverse(A) and shuffle(A) strings.\",\n    \"Use a counter to keep track of the characters you've used in constructing A, and only add a character to A if doing so won't violate the required counts of remaining characters.\",\n    \"A string A is valid if all characters in A are used up in the construction of the result string.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
