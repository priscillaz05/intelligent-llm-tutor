And if you were anything like me, you 'knew' that the numerals were not used for zeroes or fractions; but not so!\\n\\nI learned something new today: the [Romans did use fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals#Special_values) and there was even a glyph used to indicate zero.\\n\\nSo in this kata, we will be implementing Roman numerals and fractions.\\n\\nAlthough the Romans used base 10 for their counting of units, they used base 12 for their fractions. The system used dots to represent twelfths, and an `S` to represent a half like so:\\n\\n* ^(1)/12 = `.`\\n* ^(2)/12 = `:`\\n* ^(3)/12 = `:.`\\n* ^(4)/12 = `::`\\n* ^(5)/12 = `:.:`\\n* ^(6)/12 = `S`\\n* ^(7)/12 = `S.`\\n* ^(8)/12 = `S:`\\n* ^(9)/12 = `S:.`\\n* ^(10)/12 = `S::`\\n* ^(11)/12 = `S:.:`\\n* ^(12)/12 = `I` (as usual)\\n\\nFurther, zero was represented by `N`\\n\\n## Kata\\n\\nComplete the method that takes two parameters: an integer component in the range 0 to 5000 inclusive, and an optional fractional component in the range 0 to 11 inclusive.\\n\\nYou must return a string with the encoded value. Any input values outside the ranges given above should return `\\\"NaR\\\"` (i.e. \\\"Not a Roman\\\" :-)\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\n```python\\nroman_fractions(-12)     #=> \\\"NaR\\\"\\nroman_fractions(0, -1)   #=> \\\"NaR\\\"\\nroman_fractions(0, 12)   #=> \\\"NaR\\\"\\nroman_fractions(0)       #=> \\\"N\\\"\\nroman_fractions(0, 3)    #=> \\\":.\\\"\\nroman_fractions(1)       #=> \\\"I\\\"\\nroman_fractions(1, 0)    #=> \\\"I\\\"\\nroman_fractions(1, 5)    #=> \\\"I:.:\\\"\\nroman_fractions(1, 9)    #=> \\\"IS:.\\\"\\nroman_fractions(1632, 2) #=> \\\"MDCXXXII:\\\"\\nroman_fractions(5000)    #=> \\\"MMMMM\\\"\\nroman_fractions(5001)    #=> \\\"NaR\\\"\\n```\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"FRACTIONS = ' . : :. :: :.: S S.

If either of these is outside their allowed ranges, the function should return `NaR`. If both integer and fractional components are 0, the function should return `N`.\\n- Roman Numeral Conversion Strategy: Convert the integer part into Roman numerals using standard place value decomposition (thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones). Store the Roman numeral representations for each place value (I-IX, X-XC, C-CM, M-MMMMM) in arrays or lists.\\n- Fractional Part Conversion: Use a lookup to convert the fractional part to the appropriate Roman fraction representation (., :, :., ::, etc.).\\n- String Concatenation and Return: Combine the Roman numeral representation of the integer part with the fractional part, and return the final string.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the valid input ranges for the integer and fractional parts?\",\n    \"How should the function behave when the input is outside the valid ranges?\",\n    \"How are Roman numerals for integer parts constructed from thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones?\",\n    \"How are Roman fractions represented and mapped to fractional values?\",\n    \"How should the integer and fractional parts be combined to form the final result?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The integer part should be between 0 and 5000 inclusive, and the fractional part should be between 0 and 11 inclusive.\",\n    \"If the input is outside the valid range, the function should return 'NaR'.\",\n    \"Roman numerals are constructed by concatenating the Roman numeral representation of the thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones places, by using lookup arrays/lists.\",\n    \"Roman fractions are represented using dots (.), colons (:), and the letter S.
