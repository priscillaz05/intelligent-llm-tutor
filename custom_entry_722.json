A single-valued subtree is defined as a subtree where all nodes have the same value.\\n- Identifying Edge Cases: Consider cases where the tree is empty, or consists of a single node, or cases where the left or right child is None.\\n- Choosing Traversal Strategy: Decide on a tree traversal strategy like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). DFS (specifically a post-order traversal) is well-suited because it allows processing the subtrees before the root, which is essential to determine if the subtree is single-valued.\\n- Implementing Recursive Helper Function: Create a recursive function to traverse the tree. This function will check if each subtree is single-valued. It returns a boolean indicating whether the subtree is single-valued and the value of the root of that subtree.\\n- Managing the Global Counter: Keep a global counter to keep track of the total single-valued subtrees encountered during the traversal. Each time a single-valued subtree is identified, this counter will be incremented.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What constitutes a single-valued subtree, and how does this definition influence your approach to the problem?\",\n    \"How would you handle the base cases for your recursive traversal, such as when the node is None or a leaf node?\",\n    \"Why is a post-order (DFS) traversal strategy more appropriate for this problem than other traversal strategies?\",\n    \"How will your recursive helper function return necessary information (i.e. isSingleValued and root data) to the calling functions?\",\n    \"How can you keep track of the count of all single-valued subtrees encountered during the traversal?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A single-valued subtree is a subtree where every node has the same value.  This means you have to check that every node in a subtree matches the value of the root node of that subtree.\",\n    \"If the node is None, return True, since an empty tree is considered a single-valued subtree with no value. If it's a leaf node, increment the global counter and return True with the leaf node's value.\",\n    \"Post-order traversal is beneficial because we need to determine if the left and right subtrees are single-valued before checking if the current node and its subtrees form a single-valued subtree.\",\n    \"The helper function should return a tuple or list that includes a boolean value (indicating if the subtree is single valued or not) and the data value of the root node of that subtree.
