The goal is to minimize the number of changes made to the original sequence.\\n- Identifying a Solution Strategy: The minimal number of changes required is equivalent to the difference between the total number of elements and the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) within the given sequence. First filter out all non-positive numbers, as those will always need to be changed. Then to make a sequence 'wonderful' or 'strictly increasing', the algorithm should identify the LIS. Then, all elements not included in the LIS need to be modified.\\n- Handling Constraints: The sequence can contain any positive integers up to 2,000,000,000, and the length of the sequence can be up to 100,000. These constraints suggest that an efficient algorithm for finding the LIS is necessary. Classic dynamic programming or patience sorting (which leads to binary search optimization) could be employed.\\n- Edge Cases and Optimizations: Consider edge cases such as an empty input sequence or a sequence that is already 'wonderful'. In those cases, the number of changes would be 0. Also, remove non-positive numbers from the sequence before finding the LIS, because they are non-eligible to be part of the LIS.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is a 'wonderful sequence' as defined in this problem, and what properties must it have?\",\n    \"How does the problem constrain the changes you can make to the original sequence to turn it into a wonderful sequence?\",\n    \"Why is finding the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) crucial to solving this problem, and how does it relate to minimizing changes?\",\n    \"Before calculating the LIS, what preprocessing steps should you take, considering the constraint that all numbers in the 'wonderful sequence' must be positive?\",\n    \"What efficient algorithms could you use to compute the LIS, given the size constraints of the input sequence?\",\n    \"If the input sequence is already a 'wonderful sequence' or empty, what should the algorithm return without further computation?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A 'wonderful sequence' is a sequence of integers that are strictly increasing and positive.\",\n    \"The problem requires minimizing the number of changes to the original sequence to transform it into a wonderful sequence.\",\n    \"Finding the LIS is important because the minimal number of changes needed is equal to the total number of elements minus the length of the LIS.
