Be mindful of integer overflow if the sum of subarrays becomes very large.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Consider using a sliding window approach to efficiently calculate the sum of subarrays. Determine how to expand and contract the window to maintain the sum within the limit X while searching for the maximum sum.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Ensure proper index calculations when expanding or contracting the window.
