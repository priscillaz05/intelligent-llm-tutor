Let's call the genome the string \\\"ACTG\\\".\\n\\nMaxim was very boring to sit in class, so the teacher came up with a task for him: on a given string $s$ consisting of uppercase letters and length of at least $4$, you need to find the minimum number of operations that you need to apply, so that the genome appears in it as a substring. For one operation, you can replace any letter in the string $s$ with the next or previous in the alphabet. For example, for the letter \\\"D\\\" the previous one will be \\\"C\\\", and the next\u00a0\u2014 \\\"E\\\". In this problem, we assume that for the letter \\\"A\\\", the previous one will be the letter \\\"Z\\\", and the next one will be \\\"B\\\", and for the letter \\\"Z\\\", the previous one is the letter \\\"Y\\\", and the next one is the letter \\\"A\\\".\\n\\nHelp Maxim solve the problem that the teacher gave him.\\n\\nA string $a$ is a substring of a string $b$ if $a$ can be obtained from $b$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($4 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 50$)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the string $s$.\\n\\nThe second line contains the string $s$, consisting of exactly $n$ uppercase letters of the Latin alphabet.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nOutput the minimum number of operations that need to be applied to the string $s$ so that the genome appears as a substring in it.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n4\\nZCTH\\n\\nOutput\\n2\\nInput\\n5\\nZDATG\\n\\nOutput\\n5\\nInput\\n6\\nAFBAKC\\n\\nOutput\\n16\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first example, you should replace the letter \\\"Z\\\" with \\\"A\\\" for one operation, the letter \\\"H\\\"\u00a0\u2014 with the letter \\\"G\\\" for one operation. You will get the string \\\"ACTG\\\", in which the genome is present as a substring.\\n\\nIn the second example, we replace the letter \\\"A\\\" with \\\"C\\\" for two operations, the letter \\\"D\\\"\u00a0\u2014 with the letter \\\"A\\\" for three operations. You will get the string \\\"ZACTG\\\", in which there is a genome.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import sys as snus\\nn = int(snus.stdin.readline())\\ns = snus.stdin.readline()\\nans = 10 ** 4\\ngen = 'ACTG'\\nfor i in range(n - 3):\\n\\ts1 = s[i:i + 4]\\n\\ta = 0\\n\\tfor j in range(4):\\n\\t\\tb = abs(ord(s1[j]) - ord(gen[j]))\\n\\t\\tb = min(b, 26 - b)\\n\\t\\ta += b\\n\\tans = min(ans, a)\\nprint(ans)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understand the problem: The problem requires finding the minimum number of operations (letter changes) to make \\\"ACTG\\\" a substring of a given string s.\\n- Consider the constraints: The length of s is between 4 and 50. Changes wrap around the alphabet (A follows Z, Z precedes A).\\n- Devise a plan: Iterate through all substrings of length 4 in the given string. For each substring, calculate the number of operations required to transform it into \\\"ACTG\\\". Keep track of the minimum number of operations needed.\\n- Calculate the cost of transforming a substring: For each character in the substring, find the minimum number of operations to change it to the corresponding character in \\\"ACTG\\\".  This can be calculated as the absolute difference in their ASCII values or 26 minus that absolute difference (for wrap-around).\\n- Implement the solution: Write code to iterate through the substrings, calculate the cost for each, and find the minimum cost.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the meaning of \\\"operations\\\" in this problem and how does it relate to changing letters in the string?\",\n    \"How should the wrapping of alphabets (A follows Z and vice versa) be handled when calculating the operation cost?\",\n    \"What is the most efficient approach to finding all possible substrings of length 4 within the given string?\",\n    \"How would you calculate the cost of converting a single character in the string to its corresponding character in 'ACTG'?\",\n    \"How can the minimum number of operations be efficiently tracked and updated during the iteration over all substrings?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"An operation involves changing a character to its adjacent character in the alphabet. The goal is to find the fewest such changes to make \\\"ACTG\\\" appear as a substring.\",\n    \"The operation cost is the minimum of the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters and 26 minus that difference. This handles wrapping (e.g., A to Z has cost 1, not 25).\",\n    \"Iterate through the string from index 0 to n-4. Each iteration will create a substring of length 4.\",\n    \"The cost to convert one character to another is the minimum of the absolute difference of ASCII values, and 26 minus the absolute difference.\",\n    \"Initialize a variable `min_ops` to a large value (e.g., infinity or a number larger than any possible cost). As you iterate through each substring, calculate the cost and update `min_ops` with `min(min_ops, current_cost)`.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
