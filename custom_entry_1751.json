It requires finding the minimum number of jumps to reach the last block.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Consider cases where the first block's height is less than the maximum height of all the blocks. This would make it impossible to move from the first block and should return -1. Recognize also that there may be cases where some intermediate blocks could block Chef's path.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Use a stack to store the heights of blocks reachable from the start. If the current block's height is less than the last height in stack, push it. Otherwise pop greater or equal heights from the stack.\\n- Implementing Solution Logic: If the first block's height is less than the maximum height in the block sequence, print -1. Otherwise, create a stack and iterate through all the blocks starting from the second block. Update the stack and at the end print length of stack as answer\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the conditions required to make a valid jump from block i to block j?\",\n    \"How can you determine if it is impossible to reach the last block from the starting block?\",\n    \"What data structure can be used effectively to maintain the possible next block heights to jump to?\",\n    \"How should the stack be updated to ensure that the minimum number of moves are considered?\",\n    \"Given the constraints, how can you optimize the solution to handle large input sizes within the time limit?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The conditions are: i < j, A[i] >= A[j], and for all k (i < k < j), A[k] <= A[j].\",\n    \"If the first block's height is less than the maximum height among all the blocks, then it's impossible to move from the first block to any other, and thus, impossible to reach the last block.\",\n    \"A stack can be used to maintain the possible next block heights. The stack stores heights that can be reached through valid jumps from previous blocks.\",\n    \"The stack should be updated by popping elements from the top if they are greater than or equal to the current block's height and then appending the current block's height to the stack. If the current block's height is smaller than stack[-1], simply push it to stack.\",\n    \"The solution is already O(N) time complexity.
