For each meal i (1\u2264i\u2264N) there \\n\\nis given one integer f(i) which denotes the time needed to cook it. Initially, all meals are uncooked. Each assistant \\n\\nof The Chef (there are infinite number of them) can help him with cooking.\\n\\nThe abilities of all assistants are same. There can be at most one assistant cooking at each moment. He must choose some \\n\\ncontinuous subsequence of meals with length K(any such subsequence can be chosen). And if there are uncooked meals in \\n\\nit, he will cook all uncooked meals which has the minimum cooking time among uncooked meals in the chosen subsequence. \\n\\nNothing done to another meals.\\n\\nThe dream was so interesting that he tried to solve such a problem: What is the minimum number of assistants which can \\n\\ncook all the meals assuming that each of them will cook at most once?\\nBut since the bell rings and Chef's friends has come to visit him, he will wake up after 2 seconds.

Each assistant can cook once, selecting a continuous subsequence of K meals. Within that subsequence, they cook all uncooked meals with the minimum cooking time.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints:  Assistants can only cook once. Each selects a continuous subsequence of length K. They only cook uncooked meals with the minimum cooking time within that subsequence.\\n- Devising a Solution Strategy: Group meals by their cooking time. For each cooking time, determine the indices of the meals with that cooking time. Iterate through these indices, and if the difference between an index and the previous cooked index is greater than K-1, it means a new assistant is needed. Use a defaultdict to group the indices based on their cooking time.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Consider the case when there are no meals, or when k is equal to N. Also, think about how to efficiently determine the minimum cooking time in a subsequence.\\n- Implementing the Solution: Use a defaultdict to store the indices for each distinct cooking time. Iterate through these indices and increment the assistant count whenever the distance to the last cooked meal of the same cooking time exceeds K-1.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does the problem constraint of each assistant choosing a contiguous subsequence of length K affect the solution?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently find the minimum cooking time within a subsequence of length K?\",\n    \"What data structure would be most suitable for grouping meal indices based on their cooking times?\",\n    \"How do you track the 'cooked' meals and determine when a new assistant is needed?\",\n    \"How do you handle edge cases, such as when the input array is empty or when k equals the length of the input array?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Since assistants choose a contiguous subsequence of length K, you can only cook meals within that window. If meals of the same cooking time are further apart than K, you'll need multiple assistants.\",\n    \"Since each assistant will cook all uncooked meals which has the minimum cooking time among uncooked meals in the chosen subsequence, sort the meal times and greedily consider the least possible cook time.\",\n    \"A defaultdict is suitable to group the indices by cooking time, as it allows efficient storage and retrieval of meal indices for each cooking time.\",\n    \"Track the last cooked meal index for each cooking time. If the current meal's index is more than K-1 away from the last cooked meal of the same cooking time, a new assistant is needed.\",\n    \"If the input array is empty, no assistants are needed. If k equals the length of the input array, one assistant can cook all meals with the minimum cooking time. These cases can be handled with simple conditional checks at the start of the algorithm.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
