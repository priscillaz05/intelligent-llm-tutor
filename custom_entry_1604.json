Handle edge cases such as when all elements of A[i]-i have identical values.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Realize that the maximum difference can be achieved by subtracting the minimum value of (A[i]-i) from the maximum value of (A[i]-i) across all indices. Iterate through the array to find both the minimum and maximum values of (A[i]-i).\\n- Implementation Considerations: Initialize the minimum value to a large number and the maximum value to a smaller number (e.g. 0).

If the size is one, the problem constraints are not followed. If all elements have the same (A[i] - i) value, the difference will be 0 because i != j will guarantee only one possible value.\",\n    \"The problem description does not require us to explicitly handle i!= j. The problem assumes N > 1 and that we can find at least two different values of `a[i] - i`. The current approach of finding the min and max automatically ensures we take the difference of two values when i!=j, as long as not all values of `a[i]-i` are equal\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
