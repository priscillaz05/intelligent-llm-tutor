The function takes the IPv4 address as the only argument in the form of string.\\nExample 1:\\nInput:\\nIPv4 address = 222.111.111.111\\nOutput: 1\\nExplanation: Here, the IPv4 address is as\\nper the criteria mentioned and also all\\nfour decimal numbers lies in the mentioned\\nrange.\\nExample 2:\\nInput:\\nIPv4 address = 5555..555\\nOutput: 0\\nExplanation: 5555..555 is not a valid\\nIPv4 address, as the middle two portions\\nare missing.\\nYour Task:\\nComplete the function isValid() which takes the address in the form of string s as an input parameter and returns 1 if this is a valid address otherwise returns 0.\\nExpected Time Complexity: O(N), N = length of the string.\\nExpected Auxiliary Space: O(1)\\nConstraints:\\n1<=length of string <=50\\nNote: The Input/Output format and Example given are used for the system's internal purpose, and should be used by a user for Expected Output only. As it is a function problem, hence a user should not read any input from stdin/console. The task is to complete the function specified, and not to write the full code.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def has_leading_zero(n):\\n\\tif len(n) > 1:\\n\\t\\tif n[0] == '0':\\n\\t\\t\\treturn True\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\treturn False\\n\\ndef in_range(n):\\n\\tif n >= 0 and n <= 255:\\n\\t\\treturn True\\n\\treturn False\\n\\ndef isValid(s):\\n\\tnewstr = s.split('.')\\n\\tflag = 1\\n\\tif len(newstr) != 4:\\n\\t\\treturn 0\\n\\tfor ele in newstr:\\n\\t\\tif len(ele) == 0:\\n\\t\\t\\treturn 0\\n\\t\\tif has_leading_zero(ele):\\n\\t\\t\\treturn 0\\n\\t\\ttry:\\n\\t\\t\\tele = int(ele)\\n\\t\\t\\tif not in_range(ele):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn 0\\n\\t\\texcept:\\n\\t\\t\\treturn 0\\n\\treturn 1\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: Recognize that the task is to validate an IPv4 address based on specific criteria, including the format (four decimal numbers separated by dots) and the range of each number (0-255).\\n- Identifying Constraints: Note the constraint that each number must be between 0 and 255 and that leading zeros are invalid.\\n- Defining Edge Cases: Consider edge cases such as an empty string, missing numbers, extra numbers, numbers outside the 0-255 range, and leading zeros.\\n- Choosing an Algorithmic Strategy: Plan to split the string by dots, check if there are exactly four parts, and then validate each part individually. This involves checking for empty strings, leading zeros, and if the number is in the valid range.\\n- Handling Invalid Input: Consider how exceptions might be raised if a part of the string cannot be converted to an integer and prepare to handle these exceptions.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the specific criteria that define a valid IPv4 address, and how will you check them?\",\n    \"How should the program handle the edge case where the input string does not contain exactly four numbers separated by dots?\",\n    \"How will the program determine whether a number has leading zeros and why is it important to consider this condition?\",\n    \"What steps should be taken to ensure that each number falls within the valid range of 0 to 255?\",\n    \"How will the code handle potential errors when converting string segments to integers, and what will the program do if an error occurs?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A valid IPv4 address consists of four decimal numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by dots. Each number should be checked to be within this range, and the string as a whole should follow the correct format, with no leading zeros.\",\n    \"If the input string does not have exactly four numbers, the program should immediately return 0, indicating that it is an invalid address.\",\n    \"To check for leading zeros, verify that the length of the number is greater than 1 and the first character is '0'. Leading zeros are invalid because they can change the numerical value or are simply not allowed by the standard.\",\n    \"Each number should be converted to an integer and then checked to ensure it is both greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 255. If a number falls outside this range, the address is invalid, and the function should return 0.\",\n    \"A try-except block should be used to catch ValueError exceptions that may occur if a string segment cannot be converted to an integer.
