The key constraints are perfectly balanced and striped. Perfectly balanced means it has the minimum sum of depths. Striped means the parity of a node's key is different from its left child's key and the same as its right child's key.\\n- Identifying Key Properties: Striped condition limits the possible tree structures drastically. Perfectly balanced implies a relatively complete tree. The problem is looking for very specific trees.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: The core idea is that for the tree to be striped and perfectly balanced, it can only exist for some specific values of `n`. The solution uses precomputed values to store all possible values of `n` for which such tree is possible.\\n- Implementation Details: Precompute the allowed number of nodes for such trees. The solution efficiently checks if *n* is among these precomputed numbers. It generates sequence and verifies if n is in sequence. The sequence consists of numbers related to powers of 2.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What exactly defines a 'perfectly balanced' binary search tree in the context of this problem, and how does it affect the possible tree shapes?\",\n    \"What implications does the 'striped' condition have on the possible assignment of keys to nodes in the binary search tree?\",\n    \"How can we precompute or generate the possible values of n for which a perfectly balanced striped BST can exist?\",\n    \"What edge cases or constraints do we need to consider regarding the integer keys between 1 and n, and how they're assigned to nodes while ensuring BST properties?\",\n    \"Why is the modulo operation (998244353) needed, and what does it signify about the expected magnitude of the answer?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A 'perfectly balanced' binary search tree has the smallest possible sum of vertex depths, indicating it's close to a complete binary tree.\",\n    \"The 'striped' condition dictates that the parity of a node's key must alternate down the left subtree and remain the same down the right subtree.\",\n    \"We can generate the sequence by starting with [1, 2] and iteratively appending new values following the pattern defined by the parity constraints.\",\n    \"Since keys are distinct integers from 1 to n, we should ensure that keys in left subtrees are less than the parent, and keys in right subtrees are greater than the parent, while adhering to striped parity rules.\",\n    \"The modulo operation is used to prevent integer overflow, as the number of such trees can be large.
