The key idea is to realize that for each number, we can choose to keep it as is or negate it.  If a number appears multiple times, we can only have either the positive or negative version in the final set if we choose the same sign for all instances of it, or both if we split the instances into both positive and negative. Note that 0 and -0 are same element.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Consider cases with zero values in the input array. Since 0 and -0 are the same, we can only have one '0' in the final set, regardless of how many times '0' appears in the input array. Therefore, we can count a single 0 if present and for any other number we add both its positive and negative if only its positive value is present in the set before.\\n- Developing the Algorithm: Iterate through the input array. Use a set to keep track of distinct values encountered so far. If a value is already in the set, add its negation to the set. Otherwise, add the value to the set.\\n- Optimizing for Distinct Values: The approach aims to maximize distinct values by strategically negating numbers. If both a number and its negation are present, they contribute two distinct values. If only one is present, we can potentially introduce a new distinct value by negating some instances of the number.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does the presence of zero in the input affect the maximum number of distinct values?\",\n    \"What data structure is best suited to keep track of distinct values and why?\",\n    \"If a number appears multiple times in the input, how does it affect the strategy for negation to maximize distinct values?\",\n    \"How would you handle the input if the constraints on the input values are much larger, and why is the given approach sufficient for the current constraints?\",\n    \"What is the time complexity of this approach, and are there any potential optimizations for significantly larger input sizes?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Since 0 and -0 are the same, the presence of zero contributes only one distinct value, regardless of how many times it appears in the input.\",\n    \"A set is best suited because it efficiently stores distinct values, providing quick lookups to check if a value or its negation is already present.\",\n    \"If a number appears multiple times, we need to consider whether to keep all instances positive, all negative, or some positive and some negative. The algorithm implicitly handles this by adding the value if not already present and adding its negation if the value is already present.\",\n    \"The current approach works because the input values are bounded by -100 to 100. The number of distinct possible values is limited. If the constraints were much larger, the memory and time complexities might become an issue. In that case, we could explore other approaches like using hash tables with collision resolution or bloom filters for membership checking.\",\n    \"The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of integers in the array, due to the iteration through the input. The set operations (add and in) have an average time complexity of O(1).  For significantly larger input sizes, the set lookups might become a bottleneck if hash collisions become frequent. In those cases, alternative data structures with better collision handling might be considered, but for n <= 100, this approach is very efficient.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
