"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"Soon after the Chunga-Changa island was discovered, it started to acquire some forms of civilization and even market economy. A new currency arose, colloquially called \\\"chizhik\\\". One has to pay in chizhiks to buy a coconut now.\\n\\nSasha and Masha are about to buy some coconuts which are sold at price $z$ chizhiks per coconut. Sasha has $x$ chizhiks, Masha has $y$ chizhiks. Each girl will buy as many coconuts as she can using only her money. This way each girl will buy an integer non-negative number of coconuts.\\n\\nThe girls discussed their plans and found that the total number of coconuts they buy can increase (or decrease) if one of them gives several chizhiks to the other girl. The chizhiks can't be split in parts, so the girls can only exchange with integer number of chizhiks.\\n\\nConsider the following example. Suppose Sasha has $5$ chizhiks, Masha has $4$ chizhiks, and the price for one coconut be $3$ chizhiks. If the girls don't exchange with chizhiks, they will buy $1 + 1 = 2$ coconuts. However, if, for example, Masha gives Sasha one chizhik, then Sasha will have $6$ chizhiks, Masha will have $3$ chizhiks, and the girls will buy $2 + 1 = 3$ coconuts. \\n\\nIt is not that easy to live on the island now, so Sasha and Mash want to exchange with chizhiks in such a way that they will buy the maximum possible number of coconuts. Nobody wants to have a debt, so among all possible ways to buy the maximum possible number of coconuts find such a way that minimizes the number of chizhiks one girl gives to the other (it is not important who will be the person giving the chizhiks).\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains three integers $x$, $y$ and $z$ ($0 \\le x, y \\le 10^{18}$, $1 \\le z \\le 10^{18}$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of chizhics Sasha has, the number of chizhics Masha has and the price of a coconut. \\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nPrint two integers: the maximum possible number of coconuts the girls can buy and the minimum number of chizhiks one girl has to give to the other.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n5 4 3\\n\\nOutput\\n3 1\\n\\nInput\\n6 8 2\\n\\nOutput\\n7 0\\n\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nThe first example is described in the statement. In the second example the optimal solution is to dot exchange any chizhiks. The girls will buy $3 + 4 = 7$ coconuts.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())\\nr1 = a % c\\nr2 = b % c\\nif r1 + r2 < c:\\n\\tprint((a + b) // c, 0)\\nelse:\\n\\tprint((a + b) // c, c - max(r1, r2))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Problem Description: Sasha and Masha want to maximize the number of coconuts they buy collectively by potentially transferring chizhiks (currency) between them, given individual holdings and the price per coconut.  The primary goal is to maximize coconuts, with the secondary goal of minimizing the chizhiks transferred.\\n- Initial Assessment: Calculate the number of coconuts each girl can buy independently. Then, consider if transferring chizhiks can increase the total number of coconuts purchased.\\n- Core Strategy: The number of coconuts purchased is determined by the integer division of the total chizhiks by the coconut price.  The remainder represents unused chizhiks. The core optimization involves leveraging the remainders to potentially buy an extra coconut.\\n- Conditional Logic: Check if the combined remainders of Sasha's and Masha's chizhiks are sufficient to buy an extra coconut.  If yes, calculate the minimum transfer amount.\\n- Output Formation: Construct the final output by first printing the maximized number of coconuts and then the minimized transfer amount.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the primary goal in this problem: to minimize the chizhiks transferred or to maximize the number of coconuts bought?\",\n    \"If the sum of the remainders when Sasha's and Masha's initial chizhiks are divided by the coconut price is less than the coconut price, what does this imply about transferring chizhiks?\",\n    \"How is the optimal number of coconuts calculated?\",\n    \"How is the minimized transfer amount calculated if a transfer is beneficial?\",\n    \"What data types should be used to handle potentially large input values, and why?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The primary goal is to maximize the number of coconuts bought.\",\n    \"It implies that transferring chizhiks won't help in buying more coconuts because their combined remainders are insufficient to purchase an additional coconut.\",\n    \"The optimal number of coconuts is calculated by summing Sasha's and Masha's total chizhiks and then performing integer division by the coconut price: (x + y) // z.\",\n    \"The minimized transfer amount is calculated as the difference between the coconut price and the larger of Sasha's and Masha's remainders: c - max(r1, r2), where r1 and r2 are a % c and b % c, respectively.  This is because giving this amount from one person to the other will ensure at least one of them can buy one more coconut.\",\n    \"Since the input values can be up to 10^18, `int` in Python is suitable because it can handle arbitrarily large integers without overflow. For languages like C++ or Java, `long long` should be used.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
