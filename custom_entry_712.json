Bob has thus bought her a gift \u2014 a large snow maker. He plans to make some amount of snow every day. On day i he will make a pile of snow of volume Vi and put it in her garden.\\n\\nEach day, every pile will shrink a little due to melting. More precisely, when the temperature on a given day is Ti, each pile will reduce its volume by Ti. If this would reduce the volume of a pile to or below zero, it disappears forever. All snow piles are independent of each other. \\n\\nNote that the pile made on day i already loses part of its volume on the same day. In an extreme case, this may mean that there are no piles left at the end of a particular day.\\n\\nYou are given the initial pile sizes and the temperature on each day. Determine the total volume of snow melted on each day. \\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line contains a single integer N (1 \u2264 N \u2264 105) \u2014 the number of days. \\n\\nThe second line contains N integers V1, V2, ..., VN (0 \u2264 Vi \u2264 109), where Vi is the initial size of a snow pile made on the day i.\\n\\nThe third line contains N integers T1, T2, ..., TN (0 \u2264 Ti \u2264 109), where Ti is the temperature on the day i.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nOutput a single line with N integers, where the i-th integer represents the total volume of snow melted on each day.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nInput\\n\\n3\\n10 10 5\\n5 7 2\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n5 12 4\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n5\\n30 25 20 15 10\\n9 10 12 4 13\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n9 20 35 11 25\\n\\nNote\\n\\nIn the first sample, Bob first makes a snow pile of volume 10, which melts to the size of 5 on the same day. On the second day, he makes another pile of size 10. Since it is a bit warmer than the day before, the first pile disappears completely while the second pile shrinks to 3. At the end of the second day, he has only a single pile of size 3. On the third day he makes a smaller pile than usual, but as the temperature dropped too, both piles survive till the end of the day.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import heapq\\nheap = []\\nn = int(input())\\nV = list(map(int, input().split()))\\nT = list(map(int, input().split()))\\ntmp = 0\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\tans = 0\\n\\theapq.heappush(heap, tmp + V[i])\\n\\twhile len(heap) and heap[0] <= tmp + T[i]:\\n\\t\\tans += heapq.heappop(heap) - tmp\\n\\ttmp += T[i]\\n\\tans += T[i] * len(heap)\\n\\tprint(ans, end=' ')\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understand the Problem: Read the problem carefully to comprehend the snow melting process. Realize that you need to calculate and print the total melted snow for each day.\\n- Data Structures: Use a heap to maintain the snow piles. The heap will help determine which piles melt first (smallest first) each day.\\n- Keep Track of Cumulative Temperature: Since each snow pile melts based on the *cumulative* temperature from its creation day, keep track of the cumulative temperature.\\n- Melting Logic: On each day, add the new snow pile to the heap (adjusted for cumulative temperature). Then, repeatedly remove snow piles from the heap that have melted completely (pile size <= cumulative temperature). Finally, calculate the total melted snow for the day by accounting for both completely melted piles and partially melted piles.\\n- Optimize: The overall approach should aim for efficiency by using the heap to quickly determine the snow piles that melt entirely or partially each day.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you efficiently store the volume of snow piles and track their melting?\",\n    \"What does 'shrinking a pile to or below zero, it disappears forever' imply for the algorithm?\",\n    \"How does the cumulative temperature impact the melting process of each pile?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases or special conditions that must be accounted for in the algorithm?\",\n    \"How can we optimize the calculation of total snow melted each day?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A min-heap (priority queue) can efficiently store the snow piles by their effective remaining volume, adjusted for the cumulative temperature.\",\n    \"It implies that we need to remove the snow pile from our data structure if its volume becomes zero or negative.\",\n    \"The cumulative temperature determines how much each pile has melted. Piles made earlier are affected by all the temperatures since their creation, meaning their initial value needs to be offsetted by the current cumulative temperature.\",\n    \"Edge cases to consider are the initial state (first day), days when no snow melts, or days when all piles melt. The cumulative temperature must also be handled carefully.\",\n    \"Using a min-heap allows us to efficiently retrieve the smallest pile that melts first. Also, we can calculate melted snow for existing piles more efficiently rather than iterating all of them.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
