The state can be represented as (row, col, remaining_k). A set can keep track of visited states to avoid cycles.\\n- Edge Case Handling: If k is large enough to remove all walls in the shortest possible path (without any walls), the shortest path is simply m + n - 2. If no path exists, return -1.\\n- Algorithm Implementation: Use a queue for BFS. At each cell, explore the four possible directions (up, down, left, right). Update the remaining k if we encounter a wall. Only add a cell to the queue if it's within bounds, k is non-negative, and the state hasn't been visited before.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the significance of the value 'k' in the context of this problem, and how does it affect the possible solutions?\",\n    \"Why is Breadth-First Search (BFS) a suitable algorithm for finding the shortest path in this problem?\",\n    \"How do you represent the state of a cell in the BFS algorithm, and what information does it need to contain?\",\n    \"What conditions need to be satisfied before adding a neighboring cell to the queue during the BFS traversal?\",\n    \"In what scenario can you determine the shortest path without performing a full BFS traversal, and what is that shortest path?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The value 'k' represents the maximum number of walls that can be removed. It determines whether a path exists and the length of the shortest possible path.\",\n    \"BFS guarantees finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph (or in this case, a graph where each move has a cost of 1).\",\n    \"The state should be represented as (row, col, remaining_k), where (row, col) is the cell's coordinates and remaining_k is the number of walls we can still remove.\",\n    \"A neighboring cell can only be added to the queue if it's within the bounds of the matrix, the remaining k is non-negative after potentially removing a wall at that cell, and the state (row, col, remaining_k) hasn't been visited before.\",\n    \"If k is greater than or equal to m + n - 2, that means we can remove at most all the walls for a path from the top left corner to the bottom right corner.
