Note that the order of elements within the group does not matter, so combinations should be used.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Since the numbers can be large, ensure there aren't integer overflow issues when calculating the sum. Also, consider using modulo arithmetic to avoid large numbers. Consider different cases for combination of numbers that are divisible by 3. (All numbers divisible by 3, remainder 1 + remainder 2, all remainders same are divisible by 3)\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Consider using dynamic programming or combinatorics to efficiently count the number of valid groups. Employ modulo arithmetic to handle potential integer overflows. The key is to count the numbers having remainder 0, 1, and 2 when divided by 3.\\n- Implementing Efficient Counting: Implement the counting logic by first computing the counts of numbers with remainder 0, 1, and 2 when divided by 3. Calculate groups of size 2 and size 3 separately, then sum to get the total.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the possible ways in which a sum of 2 or 3 numbers can be divisible by 3?\",\n    \"How can you avoid integer overflow issues when dealing with large numbers in the array?\",\n    \"Can you explain the logic behind counting the number of groups with a sum divisible by 3 by counting numbers with remainder 0, 1, and 2 when divided by 3?\",\n    \"What data structure can be used to efficiently store the counts of numbers with different remainders when divided by 3?\",\n    \"Can you provide a specific formula to calculate the number of groups of 2 and 3 integers whose sum is divisible by 3 based on the counts of remainders?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"For a sum of 2 numbers to be divisible by 3, the two numbers must either both be divisible by 3 (remainder 0) or have remainders that add up to 3 (one with remainder 1 and the other with remainder 2). For a sum of 3 numbers to be divisible by 3, all three numbers could be divisible by 3, or they could all have the same remainder (either all 1 or all 2), or they could each have a different remainder (1, 2, and 0).\",\n    \"Use modulo arithmetic throughout the calculation. Specifically, take the modulo of each number with 3 to determine its remainder, and then perform calculations using these remainders.\",\n    \"The remainders when divided by 3 determine whether the sum is divisible by 3.
