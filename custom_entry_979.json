Each query adds a number X to S and also adds the XOR of X with every existing element in S (excluding X itself). After each query, the count of elements with even and odd parity (number of 1s in binary representation) are reported.\\n- Data Structures: Using a set to store the elements ensures no duplicates. Two variables are needed to keep track of elements with even and odd parity.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: For each query, first determine the parity of the given number X. If X is not already in the set S, calculate XORs with other members. Keep counters for the even and odd parity elements and update them accordingly.\\n- Edge Cases and Constraints: Ensure that the program handles constraints appropriately (1 <= T <= 5, 1 <= Q, X <= 10^5). Efficient set operations are important to avoid TLE for larger inputs.\\n- Parity Calculation: A function is needed to efficiently calculate the parity of an integer.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you efficiently calculate the parity (number of 1s) of a given number X in the binary representation?\",\n    \"How should you update the counts of elements with even and odd parities after each query?\",\n    \"What data structure is best suited to avoid duplicate elements in the set S?\",\n    \"What special conditions or edge cases should you handle to ensure that the solution works for all possible inputs?\",\n    \"How can you optimize the set operations to ensure that the solution does not exceed the time limit for larger inputs?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"You can convert the number to its binary representation using bin(X) and count the number of '1's. Alternatively, for optimization, lookup tables or bit manipulation techniques can be used.\",\n    \"When adding a new number X to S, determine its parity. Add 1 to the respective parity counter. When adding XOR results, determine the parity of each XOR result and increment corresponding parity counters. Use previous even/odd parity counts to determine how new XOR values impact current even/odd parity totals.\",\n    \"A set is best suited because it automatically handles duplicates.\",\n    \"Consider empty set initially, handling of duplicates while inserting elements, checking for constraints violation. Also consider if XOR of the same number occurs, which would result in zero.\",\n    \"Utilize sets effectively (e.g. set.union) and avoid unnecessary looping.
