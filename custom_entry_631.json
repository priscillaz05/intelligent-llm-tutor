Today they want to play something new and came across Twitter on their father's laptop.\\n\\nThey saw it for the first time but were already getting bored to see a bunch of sentences having at most 140 characters each. The only thing they liked to play with it is, closing and opening tweets.\\n\\nThere are N tweets on the page and each tweet can be opened by clicking on it, to see some statistics related to that tweet. Initially all the tweets are closed. Clicking on an open tweet closes it and clicking on a closed tweet opens it. There is also a button to close all the open tweets. Given a sequence of K clicks by Jack, Evan has to guess the total number of open tweets just after each click.\\n\\n-----Input-----\\nFirst line contains two integers N K, the number of tweets (numbered 1 to N) and the number of clicks respectively (1 \u2264 N, K \u2264 1000). Each of the following K lines has one of the following.\\n\\n- CLICK X , where X is the tweet number (1 \u2264 X \u2264 N)\\n- CLOSEALL\\n\\n-----Output-----\\nOutput K lines, where the ith line should contain the number of open tweets just after the ith click.\\n\\n-----Example-----\\nInput:\\n3 6\\nCLICK 1\\nCLICK 2\\nCLICK 3\\nCLICK 2\\nCLOSEALL\\nCLICK 1\\n\\nOutput:\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n2\\n0\\n1\\n\\nExplanation:\\n\\nLet open[x] = 1 if the xth tweet is open and 0 if its closed.\\n\\nInitially open[1..3] = { 0 , 0 , 0 }. Here is the state of open[1..3] after each click and corresponding count of open tweets.\\n\\nCLICK 1 : { 1, 0, 0 }, open count = 1\\n\\nCLICK 2 : { 1, 1, 0 }, open count = 2\\n\\nCLICK 3 : { 1, 1, 1 }, open count = 3\\n\\nCLICK 2 : { 1, 0, 1 }, open count = 2\\n\\nCLOSEALL : { 0, 0, 0 }, open count = 0\\n\\nCLICK 1 : { 1, 0, 0 }, open count = 1\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def getInput():\\n\\tN_k = input().split()\\n\\tN = int(N_k[0])\\n\\tk = int(N_k[1])\\n\\tlist = []\\n\\toutput = []\\n\\tcount = 0\\n\\tfor i in range(0, k):\\n\\t\\tval = input()\\n\\t\\tif val != 'CLOSEALL':\\n\\t\\t\\tval = val.split()\\n\\t\\t\\tval = int(val[1])\\n\\t\\t\\tif val not in list:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcount = count + 1\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlist.append(val)\\n\\t\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlist.remove(val)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcount = count - 1\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tcount = 0\\n\\t\\t\\twhile len(list) > 0:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlist.pop()\\n\\t\\toutput.append(count)\\n\\tfor each in output:\\n\\t\\tprint(each)\\ngetInput()\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem simulates a simplified Twitter interaction where tweets can be opened and closed. The task is to track the number of open tweets after a sequence of clicks and 'CLOSEALL' operations.\\n- Data Structures: Use a list or set to store the open tweets. A list allows easy addition and removal of tweets, while a set avoids duplicates. A counter variable will keep track of how many tweets are open at a given time.\\n- Algorithm: Iterate through each click. If it's a 'CLICK X', check if tweet X is open. If open, close it (remove from the list and decrement the counter). If closed, open it (add to the list and increment the counter). If it's a 'CLOSEALL', clear the list and reset the counter to 0.\\n- Edge Cases: Handle cases where N and K are at their minimum or maximum values (1 and 1000). Also, ensure that the tweet number X is within the valid range (1 to N).\\n- Output: After each click, output the current count of open tweets.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you represent the state of open and closed tweets in the code?\",\n    \"What data structure is most appropriate for efficiently tracking open tweets, considering that tweets can be toggled open or closed?\",\n    \"How can the 'CLOSEALL' operation be implemented efficiently using the chosen data structure?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases or constraints to consider for the tweet number (X) during a 'CLICK X' operation?\",\n    \"How would you optimize the code for cases where there are many 'CLOSEALL' operations interspersed with 'CLICK X' operations?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The state of open and closed tweets can be represented using a list or a set. Alternatively, a boolean array of size N can be used, where True indicates an open tweet and False indicates a closed tweet. A counter variable is used to track the number of open tweets.\",\n    \"A list or set is suitable for tracking open tweets, providing quick add and remove operations. If memory usage is a major concern, a boolean array may be slightly more efficient in space, but lists and sets offer better readability and ease of use.\",\n    \"The 'CLOSEALL' operation can be implemented by clearing the list/set representing open tweets and resetting the counter to 0. This operation has O(1) complexity in many list/set implementations.\",\n    \"The tweet number (X) should be validated to ensure it is within the range of 1 to N. If X is out of this range, the code should either ignore the click or raise an error, depending on the specific requirements.\",\n    \"The code can be optimized to reset the open tweets representation (list/set) when a CLOSEALL operation is called. The time complexity for a close all will be O(1) as only the list/set and the counter will be reset.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
