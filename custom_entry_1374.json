The removal process needs to be recursive, which means the removal should continue until no more adjacent duplicates exist.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Special consideration is required for cases where the final string might be empty. The function must return an empty string in such cases.\\n- Choosing an Algorithmic Strategy: The efficient approach is to use a nested loop-based approach or recursion, where the outer loop checks for changes (whether any removal occurred in a pass), and the inner loop removes adjacent duplicates.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Because the removal is recursive, you need to call a function until it stops removing characters in string.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean to remove adjacent duplicate characters recursively, and how does this impact the approach?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: It means that after removing one set of adjacent duplicate characters, we must continue to check for more duplicates in the resultant string until no more such duplicates exist.\",\n    \"How would you handle the situation where the final string becomes empty after removing all adjacent duplicate characters?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: The function should explicitly check if the final string is empty and return an empty string in that scenario.\",\n    \"Can you describe an efficient algorithmic strategy for removing adjacent duplicates from the string?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: One approach is to iterate through the string. If you find two adjacent identical characters, remove them. Continue the process on the modified string until no more adjacent duplicates are found.
