Having heard these observations, Dr. Extreme proposed a theory of \\\"super stars\\\". Do not take this term as a description of actors or singers. It is a revolutionary theory in astronomy.\\n\\nAccording to this theory, stars we are observing are not independent objects, but only small portions of larger objects called super stars. A super star is filled with invisible (or transparent) material, and only a number of points inside or on its surface shine. These points are observed as stars by us.\\n\\nIn order to verify this theory, Dr. Extreme wants to build motion equations of super stars and to compare the solutions of these equations with observed movements of stars. As the first step, he assumes that a super star is sphere-shaped, and has the smallest possible radius such that the sphere contains all given stars in or on it. This assumption makes it possible to estimate the volume of a super star, and thus its mass (the density of the invisible material is known).\\n\\nYou are asked to help Dr. Extreme by writing a program which, given the locations of a number of stars, finds the smallest sphere containing all of them in or on it. In this computation, you should ignore the sizes of stars. In other words, a star should be regarded as a point. You may assume the universe is a Euclidean space.\\n\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe input consists of multiple data sets. Each data set is given in the following format.\\n\\n\\nn\\nx1 y1 z1\\nx2 y2 z2\\n...\\nxn yn zn\\n\\n\\nThe first line of a data set contains an integer n, which is the number of points. It satisfies the condition 4 \u2264 n \u2264 30.\\n\\nThe locations of n points are given by three-dimensional orthogonal coordinates: (xi, yi, zi) (i = 1,..., n). Three coordinates of a point appear in a line, separated by a space character.\\n\\nEach value is given by a decimal fraction, and is between 0.0 and 100.0 (both ends inclusive). Points are at least 0.01 distant from each other.\\n\\nThe end of the input is indicated by a line containing a zero.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nFor each data set, the radius ofthe smallest sphere containing all given points should be printed, each in a separate line. The printed values should have 5 digits after the decimal point. They may not have an error greater than 0.00001.\\n\\nExample\\n\\nInput\\n\\n4\\n10.00000 10.00000 10.00000\\n20.00000 10.00000 10.00000\\n20.00000 20.00000 10.00000\\n10.00000 20.00000 10.00000\\n4\\n10.00000 10.00000 10.00000\\n10.00000 50.00000 50.00000\\n50.00000 10.00000 50.00000\\n50.00000 50.00000 10.00000\\n0\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n7.07107\\n34.64102\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def distance(star, position):\\n\\treturn sum([(a - b) ** 2 for (a, b) in zip(star, position)]) ** (1 / 2)\\n\\ndef difference(star, position):\\n\\treturn [a - b for (a, b) in zip(star, position)]\\nwhile True:\\n\\tn = int(input())\\n\\tif n == 0:\\n\\t\\tbreak\\n\\tstars = [list(map(float, input().split())) for i in range(n)]\\n\\tposition = [sum([s[i] for s in stars]) / len(stars) for i in range(3)]\\n\\tmove_rate = 1\\n\\tfor i in range(3000):\\n\\t\\tif i % 100 == 0:\\n\\t\\t\\tmove_rate /= 2\\n\\t\\tindex = 0\\n\\t\\tdis_max = 0\\n\\t\\tfor (j, star) in enumerate(stars):\\n\\t\\t\\tdis = distance(star, position)\\n\\t\\t\\tif dis_max < dis:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdis_max = dis\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindex = j\\n\\t\\tdiff = difference(stars[index], position)\\n\\t\\tposition = [position[i] + diff[i] * move_rate for i in range(3)]\\n\\tprint(format(dis_max, '.5f'))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires finding the smallest sphere that encloses a given set of 3D points (stars). The output should be the radius of this sphere, formatted to 5 decimal places.\\n- Choosing an Algorithm: The provided solution utilizes an iterative approximation method. It starts with the center as the average of all points, and then iteratively moves the center towards the furthest point, reducing the step size as it iterates. This continues for a fixed number of iterations (3000 in the given solution).\\n- Handling Input: The input consists of multiple datasets, each starting with the number of points (n) followed by the coordinates of each point. The input ends with n = 0.\\n- Implementation Details: The core logic involves calculating distances between the current center and all points, finding the maximum distance (which would be an approximation of the radius), and adjusting the center to get closer to that point. The `move_rate` is used to control the step size and is halved every 100 iterations to increase precision.\\n- Output Formatting: The final radius is formatted to 5 decimal places using `format(dis_max, '.5f')`.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you calculate the distance between two points in 3D space?\",\n    \"What is the initial guess for the sphere's center, and how does the solution refine this guess?\",\n    \"Why is the `move_rate` reduced during the iterations, and what effect does this have on the approximation?\",\n    \"How does the solution handle the multiple input datasets?\",\n    \"What is the purpose of the `difference` function?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The distance between two points (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2) in 3D space is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula: sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 + (z2 - z1)^2).\",\n    \"The initial guess for the sphere's center is the average of all given points. The solution iteratively refines this guess by moving the center towards the point that is furthest from it.\",\n    \"The `move_rate` is reduced to decrease the step size as the iterations progress. This allows for a more precise approximation of the optimal center and radius.\",\n    \"The solution uses a `while True` loop that reads the number of points `n` for each dataset. If `n` is 0, the loop breaks, indicating the end of the input. Each dataset is processed within the loop.\",\n    \"The `difference` function calculates the vector from the current center to the furthest star.
