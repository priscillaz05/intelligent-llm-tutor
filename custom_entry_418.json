The goal is to find and output any such 'good pair' given an array of positive integers.\\n- Identifying Key Insight: The absolute value equality `|a_i - a_k| + |a_k - a_j| = |a_i - a_j|` implies that 'ak' lies on the line segment between 'ai' and 'aj' (inclusive).  This will always be true if ai and aj are the min and max (or max and min).  Also if i==j, the equality holds.\\n- Selecting an Algorithm: To find a good pair, find the minimum and maximum elements in the array. Their indices will constitute a valid good pair because for any 'k', a_k will always lie between a_min and a_max, thus satisfying the absolute value equation. If min and max indexes are the same, the condition still holds.\\n- Implementation Details: Read the input, find the indices of the minimum and maximum elements, and print those indices (plus 1, since the problem uses 1-based indexing).\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the definition of a 'good pair' in this problem, and how can it be characterized using absolute values?\",\n    \"If the absolute value equality holds for all 'k', what does this imply about the relationship between the elements $a_i$, $a_j$, and $a_k$?\",\n    \"How can we efficiently identify a 'good pair' without checking all possible combinations of indices?\",\n    \"Why can we pick the minimum and maximum elements as the good pair\",\n    \"What are the edge cases or constraints that we should consider during implementation, such as the array size or the range of values?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A 'good pair' (i, j) satisfies the condition `|a_i - a_k| + |a_k - a_j| = |a_i - a_j|` for all indices 'k' in the array.\",\n    \"The absolute value equality implies that $a_k$ lies on the line segment between $a_i$ and $a_j$.
