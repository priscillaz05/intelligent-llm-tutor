Currently Jeff learns to read.\\n\\nHe knows some subset of the letter of Latin alphabet. In order to help Jeff to study, Chef gave him a book with the text consisting of N words. Jeff can read a word iff it consists only of the letters he knows.\\n\\nNow Chef is curious about which words his brother will be able to read, and which are not. Please help him!\\n\\n------ Input ------ \\n\\nThe first line of the input contains a lowercase Latin letter string S, consisting of the letters Jeff can read. Every letter will appear in S no more than once.\\n\\nThe second line of the input contains an integer N denoting the number of words in the book.\\n\\nEach of the following N lines contains a single lowecase Latin letter string W_{i}, denoting the i^{th} word in the book.\\n\\n------ Output ------ \\n\\nFor each of the words, output \\\"Yes\\\" (without quotes) in case Jeff can read it, and \\\"No\\\" (without quotes) otherwise.\\n\\n------ Constraints ------ \\n\\n$1 \u2264 |S| \u2264 26$\\n$1 \u2264 N \u2264 1000$\\n$1 \u2264 |W_{i}| \u2264 12$\\n$Each letter will appear in S no more than once.$\\n$S, W_{i} consist only of lowercase Latin letters.$\\n\\n------ Subtasks ------ \\n\\n$Subtask #1 (31 point): |S| = 1, i.e. Jeff knows only one letter.$\\n$Subtask #2 (69 point)\\t: no additional constraints$\\n\\n----- Sample Input 1 ------ \\nact\\n2\\ncat\\ndog\\n----- Sample Output 1 ------ \\nYes\\nNo\\n----- explanation 1 ------ \\nThe first word can be read.\\nThe second word contains the letters d, o and g that aren't known by Jeff.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"s = input()\\nn = int(input())\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\tword = input()\\n\\tfor l in word:\\n\\t\\tif not l in s:\\n\\t\\t\\tprint('No')\\n\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tprint('Yes')\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem states that Jeff can read words if they are made of letters from the given string S. We need to determine whether each word in the input of N words can be read by Jeff, based on the letters he knows.\\n- Input Processing: The input consists of a string S of known letters, an integer N representing the number of words, and N strings representing the words to check.\\n- Algorithm Selection: We can iterate through each word and check if each letter is present in S. If all the letters in the word are in S, then Jeff can read it. Otherwise, he cannot.\\n- Output Generation: For each word, print \\\"Yes\\\" if Jeff can read it, and \\\"No\\\" otherwise.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the core task of this problem, and what are the inputs we need to process?\",\n    \"How should we determine whether Jeff can read a given word?\",\n    \"How do we handle multiple words and generate the corresponding outputs?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The core task is to determine if Jeff can read each of N words given a set of letters S that he knows. The inputs are the string S, the integer N, and the N words.\",\n    \"For a given word, we check if each letter in the word is present in the string S. If every letter in the word is found in S, then Jeff can read the word.\",\n    \"We iterate through each of the N words and apply the reading check. For each word, we print either 'Yes' if Jeff can read it, or 'No' otherwise.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
