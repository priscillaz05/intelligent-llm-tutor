We have to avoid landmines and their four adjacent cells (left, right, above and below) as they are also unsafe. We are allowed to move to only adjacent cells which are not landmines. i.e. the route cannot contains any diagonal moves.\\n \\nExample 1:\\nInput:\\n[1 0 1 1 1]\\n[1 1 1 1 1]\\n[1 1 1 1 1]\\n[1 1 1 0 1]\\n[1 1 1 1 0]\\nOutput: 6\\nExplanation: \\nWe can see that length of shortest\\nsafe route is 13 (Highlighted in Bold).\\n[1 0 1 1 1]\\n[1 1 1 1 1] \\n[1 1 1 1 1]\\n[1 1 1 0 1] \\n[1 1 1 1 0]\\nExample 2:\\nInput:\\n[1 1 1 1 1]\\n[1 1 0 1 1]\\n[1 1 1 1 1]\\nOutput: -1\\nExplanation: There is no possible path from\\nfirst column to last column.\\nYour Task:\\nYou don't need to read input or print anything.

Only adjacent movements (up, down, left, right) are allowed. Diagonal moves are not allowed.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: The potential pitfalls include handling edge cases where no path exists, handling landmines and their surrounding unsafe cells, and efficiently searching the matrix.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Use Depth First Search (DFS) with memoization to explore possible paths from each starting cell in the first column. Mark landmines and their adjacent cells as unsafe. Optimize search by storing intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations.\\n- Implementing Safety Check: Create a helper function isSafe() to determine if a cell is safe to visit, considering landmines and boundary conditions.\\n- Managing Visited Cells: Implement a set to keep track of visited cells during DFS traversal to avoid cycles.\\n- Implementing DFS Traversal: Implement a recursive function to traverse the matrix, exploring each valid adjacent cell and keeping track of the current path length.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you represent landmines and unsafe cells in the matrix and what is the implication for pathfinding?\",\n    \"What edge cases need to be considered, and how should the function respond to them?\",\n    \"How can Depth-First Search be adapted to find the shortest path in the matrix while avoiding unsafe cells?\",\n    \"How do you keep track of visited cells to prevent infinite loops during path traversal?\",\n    \"How can memoization be used to optimize the DFS approach, and what are the benefits of doing so?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Landmines are represented as 0 in the matrix, and their adjacent cells are also considered unsafe.
