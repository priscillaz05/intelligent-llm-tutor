She seeks Zeke's help as she feels he could help her with the problem. He finds this problem very simple. The problem is to count the number of unique triplets of different numbers (N1, N2, N3), where Ni could be any positive integer from 1 to Ni, inclusive (i = 1, 2, 3). Here the numbers can not be repeated in a triplet set.\\n\\nThis looks simple right?\\n\\nBut oops !!!! There is a catch here which was missed by Zeke that the numbers N1, N2, N3 could be well up to 10^18. \\n\\nZeke finds it difficult due to large numbers in stake and needs your help for them so that he can give a solution to Penny. You need to find an optimal solution of the number of unique triplets possible which the above conditions satisfied.\\n\\nSince, the answer could be quite large. Hence you should output it modulo 10^9 + 7. \\n\\nInput:\\n\\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. \\nEach line of a test case contains three space-separated integers N1, N2, N3.\\nOutput:\\n\\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the number of required triples modulo 10^9 + 7.\\nConstraints\\n    1 \u2264 T \u2264 10^3\\n    1 \u2264 Ni \u2264 10^18\\nSample Input:\\n5\\n3 3 3\\n2 3 2\\n29 11 1994\\n1 2 3\\n1 1 50\\n\\nSample Output:\\n6\\n2\\n613536\\n1\\n0\\n\\nExplanation\\n\\nCase 1. We have the following triples composed of different numbers up to 3:\\n\\n(1, 2, 3)\\n(1, 3, 2)\\n(2, 1, 3)\\n(2, 3, 1)\\n(3, 1, 2)\\n(3, 2, 1)\\n\\nCase 2. Here the triplets are:\\n(1, 3, 2)\\n(2, 3, 1)\\n\\nCase 3. 613536 triplets exist\\n\\nCase 4. Here the only triplet is (1, 2, 3).\\n\\nCase 5. The only choice for N1 and for is N2 is 1, so any such triple will have the same numbers which does not satisfy the conditions. Hence, no triplets are possible.\\n\\nSAMPLE INPUT\\n5\\n3 3 3\\n2 3 2\\n29 11 1994\\n1 2 3\\n1 1 50\\n\\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\\n6\\n2\\n613536\\n1\\n0\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import sys\\ni=0\\nt= eval(input())\\nt= int(t)\\nwhile i<t:\\n\\ta,b,c= list(map(int,sys.stdin.readline().split()))\\n\\tif a > b and a > c:\\n\\t\\tif b > c:\\n\\t\\t   temp= a\\n\\t\\t   a=c\\n\\t\\t   c=temp\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t   temp= a\\n\\t\\t   a=b\\n\\t\\t   b=temp\\n\\t\\t   temp1=c\\n\\t\\t   c=b\\n\\t\\t   b=temp1\\n\\n\\tif b > a and b > c:\\n\\t\\tif a > c:\\n\\t\\t   temp= a\\n\\t\\t   a=c\\n\\t\\t   c=temp\\n\\t\\t   temp1=c\\n\\t\\t   c=b\\n\\t\\t   b=temp1\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t   temp=c\\n\\t\\t   c=b\\n\\t\\t   b=temp\\n\\tif c > a and c > b:\\n\\t\\tif a > b:\\n\\t\\t   temp=b\\n\\t\\t   b=a\\n\\t\\t   a=temp\\n\\tb=b-1\\n\\tc=c-2\\n\\ttog = int((a*b*c)%1000000007)\\n\\tprint (tog)\\n\\t\\n\\ti=i+1\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem is to find the number of unique triplets (N1, N2, N3) where Ni can be any positive integer from 1 to Ni. The numbers must be distinct within each triplet, and the final answer must be modulo 10^9 + 7.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: The numbers N1, N2, N3 can be very large (up to 10^18), so direct calculation of combinations might lead to overflow errors. The modulo operation should be applied at each step to prevent this.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: We need to calculate the number of ways to choose three distinct numbers, where the range for each number is defined by N1, N2, and N3. Assuming N1 <= N2 <= N3, we can consider the number of ways to pick 3 numbers from ranges [1, N1], [1, N2], and [1, N3], ensuring all numbers are different. If we simply multiply N1 * N2 * N3, we would be overcounting because we would have cases where the numbers are not all distinct. To avoid this, we consider an equivalent approach of sorting N1, N2, and N3 such that N1 <= N2 <= N3. We then calculate N1 * (N2 - 1) * (N3 - 2). The modulo must be applied during each calculation.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: We must ensure that N1, N2 and N3 are distinct and greater or equal to 1. If after sorting N1 = 1, N2 = 1, or N3 <=2, the number of triplets will be zero or one. If N1 > N2 or N2 > N3, simply swap the numbers. Apply modulo at the end.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you prevent potential overflow errors given the large input values (up to 10^18)?\",\n    \"What happens if the ranges N1, N2, and N3 are not distinct; how will it affect the number of triplets?\",\n    \"Can you explain the importance of sorting N1, N2, and N3 before calculating the number of triplets and how it simplifies the calculations?\",\n    \"What is the approach you would use to calculate the number of unique triplets, given N1, N2, and N3?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases that you will consider and why?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"To prevent overflow, I should apply the modulo operator (10^9 + 7) after each multiplication or addition operation.\",\n    \"If any of the numbers selected are the same, then the triplet would not satisfy the problem's requirement for distinct numbers, so the number of triplets would be zero.\",\n    \"Sorting N1, N2 and N3 helps to deal with distinct number.
