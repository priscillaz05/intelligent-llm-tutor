If n is not coprime with 10 (i.e., divisible by 2 or 5), the function should return -1.\\n- Identifying Key Conditions: Determine if n is divisible by 2 or 5. If so, return -1 immediately because the decimal representation will either terminate or have a non-repeating part before the repeating part.\\n- Selecting an Approach:  The length of the repeating cycle is the smallest k such that 10^k % n == 1. Implement a loop that increments k until this condition is met. \\n- Optimizing the Implementation: Use the `pow(base, exp, mod)` function for efficient modular exponentiation within the loop.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you determine if n and 10 are coprime?\",\n    \"What is the significance of the condition 10^k % n == 1 in finding the cycle length?\",\n    \"How would you efficiently calculate 10^k % n within the loop?\",\n    \"What should be the return value if n is divisible by 2 or 5?\",\n    \"How do you ensure the loop terminates and avoids infinite execution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"n and 10 are coprime if they share no common factors other than 1. In other words, n should not be divisible by 2 or 5.\",\n    \"The condition 10^k % n == 1 implies that 10^k - 1 is divisible by n, meaning 10^k has a remainder of 1 when divided by n. The smallest such k is the length of the repeating decimal cycle.\",\n    \"I can use the `pow(10, k, n)` function in Python for efficient modular exponentiation. This function directly calculates (10^k) % n without computing 10^k first, avoiding potential overflow issues.\",\n    \"If n is divisible by 2 or 5, the function should return -1.\",\n    \"The loop is designed to terminate when 10^k % n == 1. The problem assumes n is coprime to 10; under this condition, such a k must exist. However, to be more robust, a maximum iteration count could be added to handle unexpected inputs, though it is not required given the prompt details.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
