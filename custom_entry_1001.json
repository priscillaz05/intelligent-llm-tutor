As a hausmeister of DHBW, Sagheer waits till all students and professors leave the university building, then goes and turns all the lights off.\\n\\nThe building consists of n floors with stairs at the left and the right sides. Each floor has m rooms on the same line with a corridor that connects the left and right stairs passing by all the rooms. In other words, the building can be represented as a rectangle with n rows and m + 2 columns, where the first and the last columns represent the stairs, and the m columns in the middle represent rooms.\\n\\nSagheer is standing at the ground floor at the left stairs. He wants to turn all the lights off in such a way that he will not go upstairs until all lights in the floor he is standing at are off. Of course, Sagheer must visit a room to turn the light there off. It takes one minute for Sagheer to go to the next floor using stairs or to move from the current room/stairs to a neighboring room/stairs on the same floor. It takes no time for him to switch the light off in the room he is currently standing in. Help Sagheer find the minimum total time to turn off all the lights.\\n\\nNote that Sagheer does not have to go back to his starting position, and he does not have to visit rooms where the light is already switched off.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 15 and 1 \u2264 m \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of floors and the number of rooms in each floor, respectively.\\n\\nThe next n lines contains the building description. Each line contains a binary string of length m + 2 representing a floor (the left stairs, then m rooms, then the right stairs) where 0 indicates that the light is off and 1 indicates that the light is on. The floors are listed from top to bottom, so that the last line represents the ground floor.\\n\\nThe first and last characters of each string represent the left and the right stairs, respectively, so they are always 0.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the minimum total time needed to turn off all the lights.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n2 2\\n0010\\n0100\\n\\nOutput\\n5\\n\\nInput\\n3 4\\n001000\\n000010\\n000010\\n\\nOutput\\n12\\n\\nInput\\n4 3\\n01110\\n01110\\n01110\\n01110\\n\\nOutput\\n18\\n\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first example, Sagheer will go to room 1 in the ground floor, then he will go to room 2 in the second floor using the left or right stairs.\\n\\nIn the second example, he will go to the fourth room in the ground floor, use right stairs, go to the fourth room in the second floor, use right stairs again, then go to the second room in the last floor.\\n\\nIn the third example, he will walk through the whole corridor alternating between the left and right stairs at each floor.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"(n, m) = map(int, input().split())\\np = [input() for y in range(n)][::-1]\\nl = r = d = 0\\ni = j = 0\\nfor (y, t) in enumerate(p):\\n\\tif '1' in t:\\n\\t\\t(l, r) = (min(l - i, r - j) + 2 * m + 2, min(l + i, r + j))\\n\\t\\t(i, j) = (t.find('1'), t.rfind('1'))\\n\\t\\t(l, r, d) = (l - i, r + j, y)\\nprint(min(l, r) + d)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: Recognize that the problem is an optimization task where the goal is to minimize the time Sagheer spends turning off lights across multiple floors.\\n- Identifying Constraints: Note that Sagheer must turn off all lights on a floor before moving to the next floor. Sagheer starts at the bottom-left stairs and can move either left or right within a floor or up to the next floor via the stairs.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: Determine an algorithm that considers the positions of lights on each floor and the optimal direction of travel (left or right) to reach the lit rooms. Focus on dynamic programming, where the state involves the current floor, Sagheer's position (left or right stairs), and the minimum time to reach that state. The optimization involves choosing the path (left or right) that minimizes the total time.\\n- Edge Case Consideration: Account for scenarios where a floor might not have any lights turned on, or the number of floors or rooms might be small.\\n- Implementing Dynamic Programming Logic: Decide how to store and update the minimum time to reach each state. Choose appropriate data structures (e.g., a 2D array) to store the calculated minimum times and implement logic to iterate through floors, considering movements within the floor and between floors.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you represent the building and its light status using the provided input data?\",\n    \"What does it mean for Sagheer to turn off all lights on a floor before moving to the next floor, and how does this constraint affect your solution strategy?\",\n    \"What states (parameters) are crucial to consider when applying dynamic programming to this problem?\",\n    \"How would you calculate the time required to move between adjacent positions (stairs, rooms) on the same floor, and how does it affect the time complexity?\",\n    \"How do you optimize for Sagheer choosing the direction (left or right) that minimizes the time spent turning off lights on each floor?\",\n    \"What edge cases should be considered to ensure that the solution handles all possible scenarios correctly?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The building can be represented as a list of strings, where each string corresponds to a floor. '0' represents a light off, and '1' represents a light on.\",\n    \"This constraint means that all '1's on a floor must be visited before proceeding to the next floor, implying a need to consider movement direction (left or right) and the positions of the leftmost and rightmost '1's.\",\n    \"The current floor, Sagheer's position (left or right stairs), and the minimum time to reach that state are crucial.\",\n    \"Moving between adjacent positions takes 1 minute. The time complexity is affected by the need to potentially traverse all rooms on each floor to find the lit rooms.\",\n    \"To optimize, calculate the time to go to the leftmost '1' from the left stairs and the time to go to the rightmost '1' from the right stairs, and select the path that minimizes the overall time, considering the cost to move to the next floor.\",\n    \"Edge cases include scenarios where a floor has no lights turned on, or the total number of floors and rooms might be small. The initial state (ground floor, left stairs) should also be handled carefully.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
