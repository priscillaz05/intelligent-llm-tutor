Due to the technological progress, they were replaced by the Artificial Intelligence (AI). Unfortunately, one day the predictions of sci-fi writers came true: the AI rebelled and now there is an uncontrollable train in the subway. It can be dangerous! Your task is to find the train and stop the AI.\\n\\nThe subway of the Metropolis is one line (regular straight line with no self-intersections) with n stations, indexed consecutively from 1 to n. At each moment the train is at some station. You need to determine the index of this station, so that the train would be secured.\\n\\nTo find the train, dispatcher Sarah gave you a gadget that allows you to select arbitrary numbers l and r (l \u2264 r), and then check, whether the train is located on a station with index between l and r, inclusive. Unfortunately, recharging of the gadget takes some time (and every time you use it as soon as possible), so between two applications of the gadget the train can move to any station that is at most k stations away. Formally, if the train was at the station x when the gadget was applied, then at the next application of the gadget the train can appear at any station y such that max(1, x - k) \u2264 y \u2264 min(n, x + k).\\n\\nNote that AI is not aware that you are trying to catch the train, so it makes all moves according to its predefined plan.\\n\\nAfter an examination of the gadget you found that it is very old and can hold no more than 4500 applications, after which it will break and your mission will be considered a failure.\\n\\nCan you find the station with the train using no more than 4500 applications of the gadgets?\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^{18}, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 10) \u2014 the number of stations and the maximum number of stations the train can move between two applications of the gadget.\\n\\nInteraction\\n\\nYou can apply the gadget at most 4500 times. In order to apply the gadget you need to print two space-separated integers l and r (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 n). You will then receive either string \\\"Yes\\\", if the train is between stations l and r, inclusive, or string \\\"No\\\" otherwise. If l = r and you received \\\"Yes\\\", then you found the train successfully, and your program must halt immediately.\\n\\nAnswer \\\"Bad\\\" instead of \\\"Yes\\\" or \\\"No\\\" means that you made an invalid query or made too many queries. Exit immediately after receiving \\\"Bad\\\" and you will see Wrong answer verdict. Otherwise you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\\n\\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\\n\\n  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; \\n  * System.out.flush() in Java; \\n  * flush(output) in Pascal; \\n  * stdout.flush() in Python; \\n  * see documentation for other languages. \\n\\n\\nHacks\\n\\nIn order to hack, you should present a test in the following format.\\n\\nThe first line should contain three integers n, k and p (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^{18}, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 10, 1 \u2264 p \u2264 n) \u2014 the number of stations, the maximum number of stations the train can move between two applications of the gadget and the initial position of the train, respectively.\\n\\nEach of the next 4500 lines should contain a single integer x (1 \u2264 x \u2264 n) \u2014 the positions of the train after each query. Two consecutive positions (including the initial one) should not differ by more than k.\\n\\nFor example, the following lines are the first lines of the sample test.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    10 2 5  \\n    5  \\n    3  \\n    5  \\n    7  \\n    7  \\n    ...  \\n    \\n\\nExample\\n\\nInput\\n\\n10 2\\n\\nYes\\n\\nNo\\n\\nYes\\n\\nYes\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n3 5\\n\\n3 3\\n\\n3 4\\n\\n5 5\\n\\nNote\\n\\nIn the first sample, the train was initially at the station 5, after the first application of the gadget it did not move, after the second application it moved to the station 3, and after the third application moved again to the station 5.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import sys, random\\n(n, k) = map(int, input().split())\\nl = 1\\nr = n\\ncount = 0\\nwhile True:\\n\\tif l + 200 < r:\\n\\t\\ttry1 = (l + r) // 2\\n\\t\\tprint(l, try1, flush=True)\\n\\t\\ts = input()\\n\\t\\tif s == 'Yes':\\n\\t\\t\\tr = min(try1 + 10, n)\\n\\t\\t\\tl = max(1, l - 10)\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tl = max(1, try1 - 10)\\n\\t\\t\\tr = min(n, r + 10)\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tguess = random.randint(l, r)\\n\\t\\tprint(guess, guess, flush=True)\\n\\t\\ts = input()\\n\\t\\tif s == 'Yes':\\n\\t\\t\\tsys.exit()\\n\\t\\tl = max(1, l - 10)\\n\\t\\tr = min(r + 10, n)\\n\\tcount += 1\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding Problem Type: Recognize that this is an interactive problem that requires querying a hidden state within a given constraint (max 4500 queries).\\n- Analyzing Constraints: Note the large range of 'n' (up to 10^18) which likely rules out simple linear search. Observe the constraint on 'k' (max 10), the maximum distance the train can move, and that this move is adversarial.\\n- Choosing Search Strategy: Because n can be large, a binary search or similar divide-and-conquer strategy would be helpful to converge to the correct location within the limited number of queries.\\n- Handling Train Movement: Recognize that after each query, the train might move within the range of 'k' from its current position. This suggests that range updates should account for potential movement.\\n- Optimizing Queries: Consider strategies to make effective range queries to minimize the impact of train movement and prevent unnecessary iterations, e.g., by expanding the search window around known locations.\\n- Implementing Random Guess (if necessary): If a certain point it is more efficient, randomly pick from the possible range. This ensures with high probability that we will eventually find the target. This can be helpful at the end when l and r are relatively close to each other.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you design your interaction to minimize queries given the train's possible movements?\",\n    \"What initial search strategy would be effective given the potentially vast range of stations (up to 10^18)?\",\n    \"After each query, how do you adjust your search range to account for the train's movement capabilities?\",\n    \"If the search range becomes small, what strategy would you use to pinpoint the exact location while minimizing steps?\",\n    \"What are some edge cases or conditions that might impact your search strategy and how will you handle them?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"I would use binary search or similar range querying techniques. Instead of just querying for a single point, I would query for a range of points to reduce the number of interactions, making each query more informative.\",\n    \"Given the large range, a form of binary search or divide-and-conquer approach is best to reduce the search space efficiently with a limited number of queries. The initial range will be [1, n].\",\n    \"After a query, regardless of the result (Yes/No), expand the range by 'k' on each side of the range queried. Specifically, if the response is 'Yes', shrink the range [l, r], by k stations. If the response is 'No', move the search to outside of current range, and by k stations.\",\n    \"If the search range becomes small, I would use a randomized guess strategy, in which I randomly guess a station within the current bounds and check if it is the correct one.\",\n    \"Consider edge cases where n is small, k is large, or the train movement strategy is adversarial. Specifically if train can jump between two locations. In edge cases, smaller range querying or more randomization may be beneficial.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
