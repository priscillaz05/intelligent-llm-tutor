The goal is to reverse this process: given the 'after' matrix, compute the original 'before' matrix.\\n- Identifying Edge Cases and Base Cases: The element `after[0][0]` is equal to `before[0][0]`. The first row and first column of `before` can be derived from the differences of adjacent elements in the first row and column of `after` respectively.\\n- Devising the Core Logic: For elements not in the first row or column, `before[i][j]` can be derived using `after[i][j] - after[i-1][j] - after[i][j-1] + after[i-1][j-1]`.\\n- Implementing Efficiently: The solution needs to work within O(N*M) time complexity and O(1) auxiliary space. We create a new matrix to store the `before` result and then iterate through `after` to calculate the result for the `before` matrix using the derived formula.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How is the 'after' matrix derived from the 'before' matrix, and what is the significance of this process for solving the problem?\",\n    \"What are the base cases or initial conditions that you need to handle in order to start computing the 'before' matrix from the 'after' matrix?\",\n    \"For elements that are not in the first row or column, how can the corresponding values in the 'before' matrix be derived from values in the 'after' matrix?\",\n    \"What is the formula that can compute the value of the element before[i][j] from after[i][j] and neighboring elements?\",\n    \"How do you ensure that your solution meets the given time and space complexity constraints?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The 'after' matrix is calculated by summing up all elements in the 'before' matrix up to the current row and column.
