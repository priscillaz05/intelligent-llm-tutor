Zero is considered a positive number. The array should start with a positive number if one exists.\\n- Identifying Data Structures and Order: We need to separate positive and negative numbers initially while preserving the relative order. This suggests using two separate lists or queues to store positive and negative numbers, respectively. These lists can then be used to rebuild the original array in the desired alternating order.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Consider cases where there are more positive or more negative numbers than the other. After exhausting one list, the remaining elements from the other list should be appended to the end of the rearranged array.\\n- Implementation Logic: First, create two lists, one for positive and one for negative numbers. Populate them by iterating through the input array. Then, rebuild the input array by alternating elements from the two lists as long as both lists are not empty. Finally, append any remaining elements from either list to the end of the array.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean to rearrange the array while maintaining the relative order of positive and negative numbers, and how does this constraint affect your choice of algorithm?\",\n    \"How would you manage scenarios where the number of positive and negative elements are not equal, and what should happen to the remaining elements?\",\n    \"What data structures would be suitable for temporarily storing positive and negative numbers separately while preserving their original order?\",\n    \"Given the problem's constraint to modify the array in-place, are there considerations on auxiliary space, and how does your approach align with those constraints?\",\n    \"How does the rule of considering zero as a positive element influence your separation logic and the rearrangement process?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Maintaining the relative order means preserving the original sequence of positive numbers among themselves and negative numbers among themselves. This affects the algorithm by ruling out sorting or techniques that might change these sequences.\",\n    \"If one type of number (positive or negative) runs out before the other, the remaining elements from the longer list should be appended to the end of the rearranged array, still maintaining their relative order.\",\n    \"Lists or queues would be suitable because they preserve the order in which elements are added. This maintains the relative order requirement of the problem.\",\n    \"The problem states expected auxillary space of O(N), so creating new lists to store positive and negative numbers is acceptable. If the problem stated O(1) auxillary space was needed, then a different approach would need to be taken.\",\n    \"The rule of considering zero as a positive element means that any zeros in the input array should be treated as positive numbers and placed in the list of positive numbers.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
