Consider these groups of 4 cells together.\\n- Developing an Algorithm: For each group of 4 cells, count the number of 0s and 1s. The minimum number of operations is the minimum of these two counts.\\n- Handling Odd vs. Even n: Since the approach uses groups of four rotated cells, the indices used to calculate these cells need to be calculated differently if n is odd vs even.\\n- Implementation Details: Iterate through the necessary cells (up to n/2 or (n+1)/2 for rows and (n-1)/2 or n/2 for columns based on parity of n), calculate corresponding rotated cells, count the number of 0s/1s in this group and increment the answer with the minimum of the counts.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for the grid to remain the same after 0, 90, 180, and 270-degree rotations?\",\n    \"How are the cell coordinates related for cells that should have the same value after rotations?\",\n    \"How does the problem change if the grid size n is odd vs. even?\",\n    \"Can you describe the relationship of a cell with index i,j to its 3 corresponding rotated cells?\",\n    \"For each set of 4 rotated cells, how do you find the minimum number of operations to ensure symmetry?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"It means that if you rotate the grid by 90, 180, or 270 degrees, the resulting grid should be identical to the original grid.\",\n    \"For a cell at (i, j), the corresponding cells are (n-1-j, i), (n-1-i, n-1-j), and (j, n-1-i).
