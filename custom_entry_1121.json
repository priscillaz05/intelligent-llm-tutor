The output should be pairs of (buy_day sell_day) representing profitable transactions.\\n- Identifying Peaks and Valleys: Realize that profit is maximized by buying at local minima (valleys) and selling at local maxima (peaks). The problem is to find all such pairs.\\n- Iterating through the prices: Traverse the array, tracking potential buy and sell days. A buy day is found when the current price is lower than the next day's price, indicating a potential upward trend. A sell day is found when the current price is higher than the next day's price or at the end of the array, indicating the end of an upward trend.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Consider cases where the prices are continuously decreasing, resulting in no profit. In such instances, output \\\"No Profit\\\".\\n- Outputting the Results: Collect all the (buy, sell) day pairs and print them in the specified format.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you identify a potential buy day when traversing the array of stock prices?\",\n    \"How do you determine a sell day based on the stock price sequence?\",\n    \"What should you do if the stock prices are constantly decreasing, and no profitable transaction is possible?\",\n    \"How do you store and format the buy and sell day pairs for the final output?\",\n    \"How can you make sure that the algorithm considers the last day of the price list as a potential selling day?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A potential buy day is identified when the current day's price is lower than the price of the following day, indicating a possible upward trend.\",\n    \"A sell day is determined when the current day's price is higher than the next day's price, or when reaching the end of the array, signifying the end of an upward trend.\",\n    \"If the prices are constantly decreasing, and no buy and sell days can be determined that would generate profit, the output should be \\\"No Profit\\\".\",\n    \"The buy and sell day pairs can be stored in a list, with each pair represented as a tuple or a list.
