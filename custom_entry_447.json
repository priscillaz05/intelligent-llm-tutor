The sum and product are calculated modulo $10^9 + 7$.\\n- Identifying Key Data Structures: An adjacency list is needed to represent the tree. For each query set, a method to calculate the distances between all pairs of nodes is necessary.\\n- Distance Calculation Strategy: The shortest distance between two nodes in a tree can be found using Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS).\\n- Optimization Considerations: Given the constraints, pre-calculation of all pairwise distances may be time-consuming. It's crucial to optimize distance calculation for each query set.\\n- Modular Arithmetic: Ensure that all intermediate and final calculations are performed modulo $10^9 + 7$ to prevent overflow and ensure correct results.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: An edge case is a query set containing only one node, in which case the result should be zero.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you represent the tree structure for efficient distance calculations?\",\n    \"What algorithm would you choose to calculate the distance between two nodes in the tree, and why?\",\n    \"How can you ensure that all intermediate and final calculations adhere to modular arithmetic?\",\n    \"What optimization techniques can you apply to reduce the time complexity for multiple query sets?\",\n    \"How do you handle the case where a query set contains fewer than two nodes?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"An adjacency list is suitable for representing the tree, as it allows easy access to the neighbors of each node for traversal.\",\n    \"BFS can be used to find the shortest distance between two nodes in a tree, as it explores the graph layer by layer.\",\n    \"Use the modulo operator (%) after each arithmetic operation (multiplication, addition, subtraction) to ensure that the results stay within the range $[0, 10^9 + 6]$.\",\n    \"Pre-calculate distances between all nodes could be one method, but it might lead to memory issues.
