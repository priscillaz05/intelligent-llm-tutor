He decided to make some himself. After hours of efforts, he was able to collect a few ice cream sticks that resembled chop sticks. The problem was that they were not in pair.\\n\\nSaurav decided that if the difference in length of two chop sticks is not more than D, he will consider these two sticks as a pair of chopsticks. Given the length of each ice-cream stick, can you tell the final number of pairs that he can make?\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line contains T, the number of test cases.

The goal is to maximize the number of pairs.\\n- Choosing an Algorithm: To efficiently find pairs, we can sort the lengths of the sticks. Then, iterate through the sorted list, checking the difference with subsequent elements until the difference exceeds D. Increment the count if the difference is within the limit.\\n- Optimization and Edge Cases: Need to consider integer overflow issues when calculating differences, because L[i] and D can be large. Also, realize that once the difference exceeds D for a particular stick, the remaining sticks in the sorted list will have even larger differences, allowing us to stop searching for pairs with that particular stick.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does sorting the lengths of the chopsticks help in finding valid pairs efficiently?\",\n    \"What is the significance of the constraint that 0 \u2264 D \u2264 10^18, and how does it impact the algorithm's design?\",\n    \"Why is it beneficial to stop searching for pairs involving a particular chopstick once the length difference exceeds D?\",\n    \"What potential issues might arise due to the large values of N, L[i], and D (up to 10^5 and 10^18 respectively), and how should these be addressed?\",\n    \"Can you describe the time complexity of your algorithm and how it relates to the constraints on N?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Sorting allows us to efficiently check for pairs because, after sorting, we only need to check consecutive elements or elements close to each other in the sorted array. This makes checking for differences within the specified D value more structured and faster.\",\n    \"The large value of D (up to 10^18) indicates that the difference between the lengths of the chopsticks can be very large, meaning simple integer types might not be sufficient to store these differences without overflow. This might require using 64-bit integers (long long in C++ or equivalent in other languages).\",\n    \"Once the length difference exceeds D for a particular chopstick, all subsequent chopsticks in the sorted list will have even greater differences. Since the list is sorted, there\u2019s no need to continue checking; no more valid pairs involving that initial chopstick can be formed.\",\n    \"The large values could lead to memory and performance issues. Using efficient data structures and algorithms, such as sorting, is crucial. Also, potential integer overflow issues when calculating differences must be carefully considered. Using appropriate data types (e.g., long long in C++) will mitigate overflow risks.\",\n    \"The time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, which typically takes O(N log N) time. The subsequent iteration to count pairs takes O(N) time in the best case (where few pairs satisfy the condition) and O(N^2) in the worst case (where every pair satisfies the condition). However, because we stop searching once the difference exceeds D, the practical performance will be better than O(N^2), so overall complexity will be closer to O(N log N).\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
