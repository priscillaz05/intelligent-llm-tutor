However, using `index()` repeatedly can be inefficient.  Consider performance implications for larger inputs.\",\n    \"After finding the position using `index()`, you should delete the element at that position and then insert the element at the beginning of the list using `insert(0, element)`.\",\n    \"You should create an empty list to store the positions found for each query.  Append the position of each query to this list as you process it. Finally, return this list.\",\n    \"If the input list of queries is empty, you can return an empty list.
