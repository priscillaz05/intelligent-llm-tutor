Now, you are given a list of roads, bought by the Monk. You need to tell how many cities did the Monk buy.\\n\\nInput:\\nFirst line contains an integer T, denoting  the number of test cases.  The first line of each test case contains an integer E, denoting the number of roads.  The next E lines contain two space separated integers X and Y, denoting that there is an road between city X and city Y.\\n\\nOutput:\\nFor each test case, you need to print the number of cities the Monk bought.\\n\\nConstraint:\\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\\n1 \u2264 E \u2264 1000\\n1 \u2264 X, Y \u2264 10000\\n\\nSAMPLE INPUT\\n1\\n3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n1 3\\n\\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\\n3\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"#print 'Hello World!'\\nt=int(input())\\nfor i in range(t):\\n\\te=int(input())\\n\\tdic={}\\n\\tfor j in range(e):\\n\\t\\tx,y=list(map(int,input().split()))\\n\\t\\tdic[x]=1\\n\\t\\tdic[y]=1\\n\\tprint(len(dic))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem describes a scenario where Monk buys cities by purchasing roads connecting them. The task is to determine the total number of unique cities bought based on the list of roads acquired.\\n- Data Structures Choice: A dictionary is an appropriate data structure to keep track of the unique cities. Keys will represent the city IDs, and we can use a dummy value (like 1) since we only care about the presence of the city ID.\\n- Handling Input: Read the number of test cases, roads, and the city pairs connected by each road for each test case.\\n- Building the City Set: As each road is read, add both cities connected by that road to the city dictionary. Since dictionaries only store unique keys, this efficiently maintains a list of unique cities.\\n- Output: After processing all roads for a test case, the number of keys in the dictionary will represent the total number of cities bought. Print this value for each test case.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What data structure would be most suitable for storing the unique cities and why?\",\n    \"How should the input be read and processed to extract the city pairs connected by each road?\",\n    \"How can the count of unique cities be determined after processing all the road information?\",\n    \"What is the significance of constraints provided, especially regarding the range of city IDs and the number of roads?\",\n    \"How can this code be adapted to work with different input formats or a larger number of cities and roads?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A dictionary (or a set) is ideal because it stores only unique keys. Here, the city IDs are stored as keys in the dictionary to efficiently track the unique cities.\",\n    \"The input should be read line by line. The first line provides the number of test cases. Then, for each test case, the number of roads is read, followed by pairs of city IDs representing roads.  Each city ID pair is split into two integer variables.\",\n    \"The number of unique cities is simply the number of keys in the dictionary. After processing all roads, the length of the dictionary will directly give the total number of cities bought.\",\n    \"The constraints limit the size of the input. Specifically, the range of city IDs (1 to 10000) and the number of roads (up to 1000) impact the data structures used and memory considerations. If the ranges were larger, more efficient data structures and algorithms might be necessary.\",\n    \"For different input formats, the input reading part will have to be modified. If the number of cities and roads grows significantly, consider using more memory-efficient data structures or algorithms that scale well with larger datasets. If using python, consider using sets over dictionaries.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
