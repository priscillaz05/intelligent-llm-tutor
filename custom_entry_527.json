This process can be repeated as many times as you like, but you can't throw away any parts.\\n\\nCan you make the number of links between every two adjacent pearls equal? Two pearls are considered to be adjacent if there is no other pearl between them.\\n\\nNote that the final necklace should remain as one circular part of the same length as the initial necklace.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe only line of input contains a string $s$ ($3 \\leq |s| \\leq 100$), representing the necklace, where a dash '-' represents a link and the lowercase English letter 'o' represents a pearl.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nPrint \\\"YES\\\" if the links and pearls can be rejoined such that the number of links between adjacent pearls is equal.

This happens if the total number of links is divisible by the total number of pearls.\\n- Implementation Details: Count links and pearls. If no pearls, print 'YES'. If the number of links is divisible by the number of pearls print 'YES', otherwise print 'NO'.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What condition determines if the necklace can be rearranged with an equal number of links between pearls?\",\n    \"What special case should be handled concerning the pearls in the necklace and why?\",\n    \"Can you explain the logic behind using the modulo operator to decide on the output?\",\n    \"What are the possible outputs of this problem and when should each one be printed?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The necklace can be rearranged if the number of links is divisible by the number of pearls.\",\n    \"If there are no pearls, the answer is always 'YES' because there are no pearls to have links between them.\",\n    \"The modulo operator checks if the number of links is divisible by the number of pearls. If the remainder is zero, it means that links can be evenly distributed. Otherwise it cannot.\",\n    \"The output can be either 'YES' or 'NO'. 'YES' should be printed when there are no pearls or when the number of links is divisible by the number of pearls.
