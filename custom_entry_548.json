Conan has n cards, and the i-th card has a number a_{i} written on it.\\n\\nThey take turns playing, starting with Conan. In each turn, the player chooses a card and removes it. Also, he removes all cards having a number strictly lesser than the number on the chosen card. Formally, if the player chooses the i-th card, he removes that card and removes the j-th card for all j such that a_{j} < a_{i}.\\n\\nA player loses if he cannot make a move on his turn, that is, he loses if there are no cards left. Predict the outcome of the game, assuming both players play optimally.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5)\u00a0\u2014 the number of cards Conan has. \\n\\nThe next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^5), where a_{i} is the number on the i-th card.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nIf Conan wins, print \\\"Conan\\\" (without quotes), otherwise print \\\"Agasa\\\" (without quotes).\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n3\\n4 5 7\\n\\nOutput\\nConan\\n\\nInput\\n2\\n1 1\\n\\nOutput\\nAgasa\\n\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first example, Conan can just choose the card having number 7 on it and hence remove all the cards. After that, there are no cards left on Agasa's turn.\\n\\nIn the second example, no matter which card Conan chooses, there will be one one card left, which Agasa can choose. After that, there are no cards left when it becomes Conan's turn again.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"n = int(input())\\narr = [0] * 100001\\ninp = [i for i in map(int, input().split())]\\nfor i in range(0, n):\\n\\tarr[inp[i]] += 1\\nfor i in range(100000, -1, -1):\\n\\tif arr[i] % 2 == 1:\\n\\t\\tprint('Conan')\\n\\t\\texit(0)\\nprint('Agasa')\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Game Rules: Grasp the rules of the card game, especially how choosing a card removes other cards less than it. Realize that the goal is to force the opponent to have no valid moves.\\n- Identifying Winning Strategy: Understand that the optimal strategy involves analyzing the counts of each distinct card value.  The parity of the counts determines the outcome.\\n- Recognizing Key Insight: Realize that if there's at least one card value with an odd count, Conan can always win. If all card values have even counts, Agasa will win.\\n- Optimizing for Efficiency: Consider using a frequency array to store the number of occurrences of each card value. This allows for efficient determination of whether there exists any odd frequency.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the core objective of the game for each player, and how does it relate to making optimal moves?\",\n    \"If all the numbers on the cards are the same, how would the outcome of the game be determined?\",\n    \"How does the number of occurrences of each distinct card value influence the game's outcome?\",\n    \"What data structure would be most effective for tracking the counts of each distinct number on the cards, and why?\",\n    \"Given a scenario where multiple card values have odd occurrences, how does Conan guarantee a win?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The core objective is to be the player who makes the last move, leaving no possible moves for the opponent. Optimal moves are those that lead to this situation.\",\n    \"If all the numbers on the cards are the same, the winner is determined by whether the number of cards is even or odd. If odd, Conan wins. If even, Agasa wins.\",\n    \"The number of occurrences of each distinct card value is crucial. If at least one card value has an odd number of occurrences, Conan can always win. If all card values occur an even number of times, Agasa will win.\",\n    \"A frequency array (or a dictionary/hash map) would be most effective because it allows for easy tracking of the counts for each number on the cards using the card value as the index.\",\n    \"Conan can choose a card with an odd number of occurrences. This reduces the total number of cards and ensures that Agasa will be faced with a similar situation on a smaller scale until no cards are left for Agasa to select.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
