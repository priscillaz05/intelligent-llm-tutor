The graph starts 'good' and becomes 'bad' if Vertex 1 and N are connected, or if self-loops/multi-edges are created. The player making the graph 'bad' loses.\\n- Strategic Considerations: To play optimally, players need to avoid creating a 'bad' graph. This involves understanding how adding edges affects connectivity and ensuring no rules are violated.\\n- Identifying Key Winning Conditions: The core idea is to analyze when a graph will inevitably become 'bad', and force the opponent into that situation. Consider parity of the possible edges and connectedness of vertices 1 and N.\\n- Algorithm Design: Use Union-Find to track connected components. The number of possible edges is N*(N-1)/2. Calculate remaining possible edges after each move. Parity of this number and connectedness of vertices 1 and N determine the winner.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What conditions define a 'good' graph, and what does adding an edge mean in this context?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently determine if two vertices are connected, and how does this help in the game?\",\n    \"What is the maximum number of edges that can be added to the graph, and how does the parity of this number affect the winner?\",\n    \"How do you determine which player wins based on whether N is even or odd, the connected components of vertex 1 and vertex N, and the total available edges?\",\n    \"If the number of vertices is even, what condition involving the sizes of connected components affects the winning strategy?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A 'good' graph means Vertex 1 and N are not connected, and there are no self-loops or multi-edges.
