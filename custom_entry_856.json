"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"D: Sunburn-Suntan-\\n\\nstory\\n\\nAizunyan is a second-year student who belongs to the programming contest club of Wakagamatsu High School, commonly known as the Prokon club. Cute like an angel. Aizu Nyan is planning to participate in this summer festival, so I made a schedule for the band to go to listen to. I'm worried about sunburn here. All live performances are held outdoors, but Aizu Nyan has a constitution that makes it easy to get sunburned, so if you are exposed to too much ultraviolet rays outdoors for a long time, you will get sunburned immediately. I plan to avoid UV rays as much as possible by evacuating indoors while there is no live performance, but during the live performance, it will inevitably hit the sun. Therefore, Aizu Nyan thought about taking measures against ultraviolet rays by applying sunscreen.\\n\\nproblem\\n\\nIf you apply sunscreen, you can get the effect for T minutes from the time you apply it. Sunscreen can only be applied once, so I want to use it effectively. Aizu Nyan is outdoors from the start time to the end time of the live, and is indoors at other times. You'll be given a live schedule that Aizu Nyan will listen to, so find the maximum amount of time you can get the sunscreen effect while you're outdoors.\\n\\nInput format\\n\\nThe input can be given in the following format.\\n\\n\\nT\\nN\\ns_1 t_1\\n...\\ns_N t_N\\n\\n\\nThe first line is given an integer T that represents the time it takes to get the sunscreen effect. The second line is given an integer N that represents the number of live concerts Aizu Nyan listens to.

Sunscreen lasts for T minutes, and Aizu Nyan is only outdoors during the live performances. The live schedules are given in chronological order.\\n- Identifying Potential Challenges: The main challenge is determining when to apply sunscreen to maximize its effect during the live performances. The input values can be quite large (up to 10^15), so integer overflow might be a concern if not handled carefully. We need to consider that the sunscreen effect might cover multiple live performances.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: The solution utilizes a prefix sum array and binary search. Calculate prefix sums of the duration of each live performance. For each live performance, try to maximize the effect of sunscreen applied at the beginning of that live. Use binary search (bisect_left) to find the latest live performance still affected by the sunscreen. Calculate the total time covered by sunscreen and update the maximum time found so far.\\n- Implementation Details: Convert the input strings for 'T', 'N', 's_i' and 't_i' to integers. Pre-compute the cumulative sum of durations of live performances. Use `bisect_left` function to find the index efficiently. Handle the case where the sunscreen covers only a fraction of the last live performance in the considered interval.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you calculate the total time spent outdoors during the live performances if you start the sunscreen at a specific time?\",\n    \"How does the binary search using `bisect_left` help to find the range of live performances covered by the sunscreen?\",\n    \"How do you handle the situation where the sunscreen effect period extends beyond the end of a live performance or starts in the middle of a performance?\",\n    \"How would you implement the prefix sum calculations and what does the prefix sum array represent in this problem?\",\n    \"What are the constraints and how might they affect the choice of algorithms and data types used in the solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"You can calculate the time by summing up the durations of each live performance within the sunscreen's effect duration T, starting from a given application time.\",\n    \"`bisect_left` is used to efficiently find the index of the first element in the cumulative duration array that is greater than or equal to the end time after applying sunscreen. It helps determine the range of live performances covered by the sunscreen.\",\n    \"If the sunscreen effect period extends beyond the end of a live performance, you only count the duration up to the end of that performance. If the sunscreen starts in the middle of a performance, you subtract the time before application.\",\n    \"The prefix sum array is computed by cumulatively adding the duration of each live performance to the previous sum. Specifically, `a[i]` stores the total time spent outdoors from the beginning up to the end of the i-th live performance. This allows for calculating time intervals efficiently by subtracting prefix sums.\",\n    \"The constraints include the ranges of T, N, s_i, and t_i. The large values (up to 10^15) necessitate using data types that can store such large numbers (e.g., long integers) and efficient algorithms like binary search to avoid exceeding time limits.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
