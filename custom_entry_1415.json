"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"The time is 1st January 20000014 Gazu is depressed with his life as he thinks there is nothing unique about him. One day he meets a travelling coder, Gazu tells him why he is depressed, to which coder replies  \u201cEveryone is one in a zillion my brother\u201d. The coder explained it like this.\\nConsidering every man and woman marries at the age of 30 and have kids. Now if your age is A years, then imagine A years before two people got married to produce one Gazu, agreed? Good now A+30 years before (assuming when your parents married they were 30 years old) four people got married (your grand parents) to produce one Gazu. \\nCoder continues if we go back in time like A+120 years, how many people got married  just to produce one Gazu? Gazu quickly replies 32, to this coder smiles and leaves. Now Gazu asks you how many people will first get married to produce one Gazu if he go back A+N years in time. Make a program to calculate it.\\n\\nINPUT\\nFirst line will contain number of testcases t , next t lines will contains the value of A+N.\\n0<t<100         1<A+N<30,001\\n\\nOUTPUT\\nFor each testcase print the number of people who will get married at that time. Assuming every one marries at the age of 30.\\n\\nSAMPLE INPUT\\n3\\n140\\n310\\n30\\n\\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\\n32\\n2048\\n4\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"for _ in range(eval(input())):\\n\\tn=eval(input())\\n\\tprint(2**(n/30+1))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the problem: The problem describes a scenario where each generation consists of two parents. Given A+N, which represents the number of years back in time, determine the number of marriages required to produce Gazu.\\n- Identifying the mathematical relationship: The number of marriages doubles every 30 years.  Thus, the number of marriages can be expressed as 2 to the power of (A+N)/30, but since initially 2 people are required the equation becomes 2**(n/30 + 1)\\n- Implementing the calculation: Read the number of test cases, then for each test case, read A+N, compute the number of marriages using the identified formula, and print the result.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does A+N represent in the context of the problem?\",\n    \"How does the number of marriages increase every 30 years?\",\n    \"How can the number of marriages be calculated based on A+N?\",\n    \"What is the significance of the '2 people' at the very beginning?\",\n    \"What data types should be used to handle the input values and the calculated result?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A+N represents the number of years back in time from Gazu's current age.\",\n    \"The number of marriages doubles every 30 years.\",\n    \"The number of marriages can be calculated using the formula 2**( (A+N) / 30 + 1).\",\n    \"The initial two people represent the first marriage required to start the lineage.\",\n    \"Integer data types should be used for the input A+N and a float for the result of  (A+N)/30 to avoid integer division, and then convert the final result into an integer or float depending on output.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
