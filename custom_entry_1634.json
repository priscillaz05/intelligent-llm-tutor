You are given a number N, you have to output the number of integers less than N in the sample space S.\\n \\nExample 1:\\nInput :\\nN = 9\\nOutput:\\n2\\nExplanation:\\n1 and 4 are the only Perfect Squares\\nless than 9. So, the Output is 2.\\nExample 2:\\nInput :\\nN = 3\\nOutput:\\n1\\nExplanation:\\n1 is the only Perfect Square\\nless than 3. So, the Output is 1.\\n \\nYour Task:\\nYou don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function countSquares() which takes an Integer N as input and returns the answer.\\n \\nExpected Time Complexity: O(sqrt(N))\\nExpected Auxiliary Space: O(1)\\n \\nConstraints:\\n1 <= N <= 10^{8}\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import math\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n\\n\\tdef countSquares(self, N):\\n\\t\\ts = math.sqrt(N)\\n\\t\\tif N == 0 or N == 1:\\n\\t\\t\\treturn 0\\n\\t\\telif N < 0:\\n\\t\\t\\treturn 0\\n\\t\\telif N == int(s) ** 2 and N % int(s) == 0:\\n\\t\\t\\treturn int(s) - 1\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\treturn int(s) + 1 - 1\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the problem: The problem asks us to count the number of perfect squares less than a given number N.\\n- Identifying an efficient algorithm: The expected time complexity is O(sqrt(N)). This indicates that calculating the square root of N is the key to solving the problem. The integer part of the square root of N gives the number of perfect squares less than or equal to N. We need to adjust this to count only those *less than* N.\\n- Edge case handling: Consider cases where N is 0, 1 or a negative number. These should return 0.\\n- Implementation: Calculate the square root of N. If N is a perfect square, the number of perfect squares less than N will be int(sqrt(N)) - 1. Otherwise, it will be int(sqrt(N)).\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the relationship between the square root of N and the number of perfect squares less than N?\",\n    \"How should the edge cases where N is less than or equal to 1 be handled?\",\n    \"If N itself is a perfect square, how does that affect the number of perfect squares less than N compared to when N is not a perfect square?\",\n    \"How can the math.sqrt function be used to optimize the calculation within the specified time complexity?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The integer part of the square root of N is the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to N. This value either equals the number of perfect squares less than N, or it is one more than that number (if N is itself a perfect square).\",\n    \"If N is less than or equal to 1, the function should return 0 because there are no perfect squares less than or equal to 1 (or less than 0 or a negative number).\",\n    \"If N is a perfect square, the count of perfect squares less than N is int(sqrt(N)) - 1. Otherwise, it is int(sqrt(N)). For example, if N is 9 (3*3), there are 2 perfect squares less than 9 (1 and 4). If N is 10, there are 3 perfect squares less than 10 (1, 4, and 9).\",\n    \"The math.sqrt function can be used to find the square root of N in O(1) time. Taking the integer part of this result can be efficiently calculated using int(math.sqrt(N)) which contributes to fulfilling the O(sqrt(N)) complexity requirement since the number of iterations is dependent on this value implicitly.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
