Each cell contains a non-negative integer which must be added to the path's sum.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: The constraint of moving only down or right is important.  A simple summation of all numbers might not lead to the optimal result. Consider possible edge cases like an empty grid or a grid with only one cell.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Dynamic programming seems appropriate, as each cell's optimal path is related to the optimal paths of its top and left neighbors. We can build a 1D array dp to represent current optimal paths from the top row.\\n- Implementing DP update rule: Update the dp array as we traverse through the grid and make sure that dp[j] stores the minimal path sum to grid[i][j] by considering path from top (dp[j]) or path from left (dp[j-1]).\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean to find the minimum path sum from the top-left to the bottom-right, and how are you restricted in your movements?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: It means finding the path with the smallest possible sum by adding the values of the cells you visit, and you can only move down or right from any cell.\",\n    \"How might you handle edge cases such as an empty grid or a grid with only a single cell?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: An empty grid would probably return 0. For a single-cell grid, the minimum path sum is just the value of that cell.\",\n    \"How can dynamic programming be applied to efficiently solve this problem?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: Dynamic programming can be used by storing the minimum path sum to reach each cell. For each cell, the minimum path sum would be the minimum of the path sums of its top and left neighbors, plus the cell's value.\",\n    \"Given the constraints, what are the possible ways to reach any cell within the grid?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: You can only reach a cell either from the cell above it (moving down) or from the cell to its left (moving right).\",\n    \"How would you implement the update rule in a bottom-up approach using Dynamic Programming?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: I can create an 1D dp array, initialize dp[0] with the value of the top-left cell.
