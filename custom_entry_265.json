The core rules of FizzBuzz (divisible by 3, 5, or both) need to be applied to construct the FizzBuzz string efficiently.\\n- Handling Large Input: The input index 's' can be as large as 10^18. This means a naive approach of generating the entire FizzBuzz string up to 's' is not feasible. Therefore, a more efficient method for calculating the starting position and extracting the relevant substring is required.\\n- Optimizing Sequence Generation: Binary search is used to efficiently determine the number from which to start generating the FizzBuzz sequence. The `calc_start` function is defined to calculate the character length of the FizzBuzz string up to a given number.\\n- String Extraction: Once the correct starting number is found via binary search, the FizzBuzz sequence is generated for the next 30 numbers to ensure a 20-character substring can be extracted. The substring starting at index `N - start` with a length of 20 characters is then printed.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you efficiently determine the character length of the FizzBuzz string up to a given number, considering the potential for very large numbers?\",\n    \"Given the very large input range (up to 10^18), how would you use binary search to locate the starting point in the FizzBuzz sequence?\",\n    \"How do you generate the FizzBuzz string for the numbers immediately following the starting point found during the binary search, ensuring you have enough characters to extract the desired 20-character substring?\",\n    \"How can you avoid exceeding memory or time limits when dealing with such large indices?\",\n    \"After computing the required FizzBuzz sequence, how do you extract the target 20-character substring?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"To efficiently determine the character length, I can iterate through the numbers, checking for divisibility by 3, 5, or both. Numbers divisible by 3 become \\\"Fizz\\\" (4 characters), by 5 become \\\"Buzz\\\" (4 characters), and by both become \\\"FizzBuzz\\\" (8 characters). Other numbers contribute their digit count. I can optimize this by pre-calculating character counts for ranges of numbers.\",\n    \"Given the large input range, binary search can be used to efficiently find the number from which the target substring starts. By calculating the character length up to the middle point of the current range, you can determine whether the target index falls before or after this point, narrowing the search range in each step.\",\n    \"After using binary search to find the number, I'll generate the FizzBuzz sequence for the next few numbers (e.g., up to 30 numbers) to ensure I have enough characters for the 20-character substring. This involves applying the FizzBuzz rules (divisibility by 3 and 5) to each number and concatenating the results.\",\n    \"To avoid exceeding memory or time limits, I'll avoid generating the entire FizzBuzz sequence up to the input index. Instead, I'll use binary search to pinpoint the starting number and then generate only a small portion of the sequence around that number.\",\n    \"Once the FizzBuzz sequence is computed, I'll extract the 20-character substring starting from the index calculated based on the starting number found by the binary search. This can be achieved using standard string slicing techniques.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
