"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"Midori like chocolates and he loves to try different ones. There are N shops in a market labelled from 1 to N and each shop offers a different variety of chocolate. Midori starts from ith shop and goes ahead to each and every shop. But as there are too many shops Midori would like to know how many more shops he has to visit. You have been given L denoting number of bits required to represent N. You need to return the maximum number of shops he can visit.\\nExample 1:\\nInput: i = 2, L = 3\\nOutput: 6\\nExplanation: There are 3 bits So N = 8\\nHence midori can visit 8 - 2 = 6 more shops.\\nExample 2:\\nInput: i = 1, L = 2\\nOutput: 3\\nExplanation: There are 2 bits so N = 4\\nHence midori can visit 4 - 1 = 3 more shops.\\nYour Task:  \\nYou dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function leftShops() which takes i and L as input parameter and returns the maximum number of shops that midori can visit.\\nExpected Time Complexity: O(1)\\nExpected Auxiliary Space: O(1)\\nConstraints:\\n1<= i <=N\\n1<= L <=30\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"class Solution:\\n\\n\\tdef leftShops(self, i, L):\\n\\t\\treturn 2 ** L - i\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understand the problem statement: The problem requires calculating the remaining number of shops to visit given the starting shop 'i' and the number of bits 'L' representing the total number of shops 'N'.\\n- Determine the formula for calculating N: Since L is the number of bits, N can be calculated as 2 raised to the power of L (2^L).\\n- Calculate the remaining shops: The remaining shops to visit can be calculated by subtracting the starting shop 'i' from the total number of shops 'N' (N - i).\\n- Return the calculated value.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How is the total number of shops, N, determined given the number of bits L?\",\n    \"What is the formula to calculate the number of remaining shops given the starting shop i and the total number of shops N?\",\n    \"Are there any edge cases to consider, such as when i is equal to N?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The total number of shops N is equal to 2 raised to the power of L (2^L).\",\n    \"The number of remaining shops is calculated as N - i, where N is the total number of shops and i is the starting shop.\",\n    \"If i is equal to N, then there are no more shops to visit, and the result would be 0.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
