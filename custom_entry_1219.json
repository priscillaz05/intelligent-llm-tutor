"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"Given an array of integers, transform each element into a string representing the difference between the element and the first element of the array. The string must include a sign (+ or -) to indicate whether the difference is positive or negative.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def equalize(arr):\\n\\treturn ['{:+d}'.format(i - arr[0]) for i in arr]\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding Problem: The task involves iterating through the input array, calculating the difference between each element and the first element, and then formatting the results as strings that include a sign (+ or -). The operation should be done for all the items on the array.\\n- Identifying Algorithmic Strategy: Implement a loop or list comprehension to iterate through the elements. Calculate the difference from the first element. Convert the difference to a string, ensuring the sign is included.\\n- Implementation Details: To correctly format the string, utilize Python's string formatting features to include the sign (+ or -) in the resulting string, even when the number is positive.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you efficiently iterate through the array and compute the difference between each element and the first element?\",\n    \"What Python string formatting methods can you use to ensure that a sign (+ or -) is always included in the output string?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases to consider when writing the function (e.g., empty array or single element array)?\",\n    \"How can you handle potential errors such as non-integer input in the array?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"You can use a loop or, more concisely, list comprehension to iterate through the array and perform the subtraction for each element. A list comprehension is preferable due to its brevity.\",\n    \"You can use the '{:+d}'.format() method in Python to format an integer as a string that always includes a sign. The + flag ensures the sign is present for both positive and negative numbers.\",\n    \"For an empty array, you might return an empty list. For a single-element array, the result would be ['+0'].\",\n    \"You can add error handling (e.g., a try-except block) to catch non-integer inputs and either skip those elements or raise an appropriate exception.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
