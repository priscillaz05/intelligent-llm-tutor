Funt during this year is equal to n (n \u2265 2) burles and the amount of tax he has to pay is calculated as the maximum divisor of n (not equal to n, of course). For example, if n = 6 then Funt has to pay 3 burles, while for n = 25 he needs to pay 5 and if n = 2 he pays only 1 burle.\\n\\nAs mr. Funt is a very opportunistic person he wants to cheat a bit. In particular, he wants to split the initial n in several parts n1 + n2 + ... + nk = n (here k is arbitrary, even k = 1 is allowed) and pay the taxes for each part separately. He can't make some part equal to 1 because it will reveal him. So, the condition ni \u2265 2 should hold for all i from 1 to k.\\n\\nOstap Bender wonders, how many money Funt has to pay (i.e. minimal) if he chooses and optimal way to split n in parts.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b7109) \u2014 the total year income of mr.

If `n` is even, splitting it into two equal parts (n/2 + n/2) if n/2 > 1, results tax as 2. If n is odd and n - 2 is prime, split n = 2 + (n-2) and tax will be 1 + 1 = 2, where maximum divisor of 2 is 1 and for n-2 it's 1 since n-2 is prime. Otherwise splitting into 3 parts will work, so the tax is 3.\\n- Optimizing Splitting Strategy: The goal is to minimize the sum of the largest divisors.  Even numbers can be split into 2's and have largest divisor 2, which can be written as sum of 1+1. Prime number has only divisor as 1. So based on that, split strategy need to be created.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: n can range up to 2 * 10^9, so we need to do prime check accordingly.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the maximum divisor of a number, and how does it relate to the tax Mr. Funt has to pay?\",\n    \"If n is prime, what is the optimal tax amount, and why?\",\n    \"If n is even, what is the optimal strategy to split n to minimize the tax, and what is the corresponding tax amount?\",\n    \"If n is odd and not prime, what strategies can you consider, and how do they influence the final tax amount?\",\n    \"How would you efficiently check if a large number is prime, considering the constraint 2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 * 10^9?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The maximum divisor of a number is the largest integer that divides the number (excluding the number itself). The tax Mr. Funt has to pay is equal to this maximum divisor.\",\n    \"If n is prime, the optimal tax amount is 1, since the only divisor of a prime number (other than itself) is 1.\",\n    \"If n is even, the optimal strategy is to split the number into two parts. The tax will be 2.\",\n    \"If n is odd and not prime, one strategy is to split n into 2 + (n-2).  Check if (n-2) is prime. If n-2 is prime, the tax is 1 (from the 2) + 1 (from n-2), which is 2. If n-2 is not prime. The tax will be 3.\",\n    \"To check if a large number is prime efficiently, you can iterate from 2 up to the square root of n. If you find a divisor in this range, the number is not prime. Otherwise, it is prime.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
