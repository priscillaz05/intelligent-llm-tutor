This strip is described by a sequence $A_1, A_2, \\\\ldots, A_N$, where for each valid $i$, the $i$-th cell is blocked if $A_i = 1$ or free if $A_i = 0$. Tzuyu and Nayeon are going to use it to play a game with the following rules:\\n- The players alternate turns; Nayeon plays first.\\n- Initially, both players are outside of the strip. However, note that afterwards during the game, their positions are always different.\\n- In each turn, the current player should choose a free cell and move there. Afterwards, this cell becomes blocked and the players cannot move to it again.\\n- If it is the current player's first turn, she may move to any free cell.\\n- Otherwise, she may only move to one of the left and right adjacent cells, i.e. from a cell $c$, the current player may only move to the cell $c-1$ or $c+1$ (if it is free).\\n- If a player is unable to move to a free cell during her turn, this player loses the game.\\nNayeon and Tzuyu are very smart, so they both play optimally. Since it is Nayeon's birthday, she wants to know if she can beat Tzuyu. Find out who wins.\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\\n- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.\\n- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \\\\ldots, A_N$.\\n\\n-----Output-----\\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string \\\"Yes\\\" if Nayeon wins the game or \\\"No\\\" if Tzuyu wins (without quotes).\\n\\n-----Constraints-----\\n- $1 \\\\le T \\\\le 40,000$\\n- $2 \\\\le N \\\\le 3\\\\cdot 10^5$\\n- $0 \\\\le A_i \\\\le 1$ for each valid $i$\\n- $A_1 = A_N = 1$\\n- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$\\n\\n-----Subtasks-----\\nSubtask #1 (50 points): $A_i = 0$ for each $i$ ($2 \\\\le i \\\\le N-1$)\\nSubtask #2 (50 points): original constraints\\n\\n-----Example Input-----\\n4\\n7\\n1 1 0 0 0 1 1\\n8\\n1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1\\n4\\n1 1 0 1\\n4\\n1 1 1 1\\n\\n-----Example Output-----\\nYes\\nNo\\nYes\\nNo\\n\\n-----Explanation-----\\nExample case 1: Since both Nayeon and Tzuyu play optimally, Nayeon can start e.g. by moving to cell $4$, which then becomes blocked. Tzuyu has to pick either the cell $3$ or the cell $5$, which also becomes blocked. Nayeon is then left with only one empty cell next to cell $4$ (the one Tzuyu did not pick); after she moves there, Tzuyu is unable to move, so she loses the game.\\nExample case 2: Regardless of what cell Nayeon moves to at the start, Tzuyu will always be able to beat her.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"T = int(input())\\nfor i in range(T):\\n\\tN = int(input())\\n\\tA = [int(a) for a in input().split()]\\n\\tz = {}\\n\\tc = 0\\n\\tfor i in range(N):\\n\\t\\tif A[i] == 0:\\n\\t\\t\\tc += 1\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tif c != 0:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif c in z.keys():\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tz[c] += 1\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tz[c] = 1\\n\\t\\t\\tc = 0\\n\\tif z == {}:\\n\\t\\tprint('No')\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tz_max = max(z.keys())\\n\\t\\tif z[z_max] > 1:\\n\\t\\t\\tprint('No')\\n\\t\\telif z_max == 1:\\n\\t\\t\\tprint('Yes')\\n\\t\\telif z_max % 2 == 0:\\n\\t\\t\\tprint('No')\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tfor i in range(z_max // 2 + 1, z_max):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif i in z.keys():\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tprint('No')\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\t\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprint('Yes')\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem describes a game played on a strip of cells where players alternate turns, moving to free cells. The key is understanding the constraints on movement (adjacent cells after the first move) and the condition for losing (no available move). The input array A represents blocked (1) and free (0) cells, with the edges always blocked.\\n- Identifying the Winning Strategy: Since both players play optimally, we need to determine if Nayeon (the first player) has a forced win. The solution seems to depend on the lengths of consecutive free cell segments.  If there are no free cells, Nayeon loses. If the largest segment of free cells appears more than once, Nayeon loses. If the largest segment is length 1, Nayeon wins. If the longest segment is even, Nayeon loses. If the longest segment is odd, Nayeon wins, unless a segment of length i exists, where z_max/2 + 1 <= i < z_max.\\n- Edge Cases: Handle cases with no free cells or all cells blocked at the start. Also, consider what happens when there are multiple segments of maximum length.  The problem specifies that $A_1 = A_N = 1$, ensuring edge cases are related to segments *between* the blocked ends.\\n- Algorithmic Approach: Identify the lengths of consecutive free cells. Store these lengths and their frequencies. Determine the maximum length. Apply logic based on the frequency of the maximum length and whether it is odd or even. If it's odd, check if any other intermediate segment lengths exist, which could change the outcome.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do the constraints $A_1 = A_N = 1$ simplify the problem?\",\n    \"How does the parity (odd or even) of the longest consecutive free cell segment affect the outcome of the game, and why?\",\n    \"In the case where the longest segment length is odd, what other conditions must be checked to determine the winner?\",\n    \"What happens if the dictionary z storing the segment lengths is empty?\",\n    \"How do you determine the lengths of consecutive free cells from the input array A?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The constraints $A_1 = A_N = 1$ ensure that there are blocked cells at both ends of the strip. This means we only need to consider sequences of free cells *between* blocked cells. This simplifies the logic by eliminating the need to handle edge cases where a free cell segment extends to the very beginning or end of the strip.\",\n    \"The parity of the longest consecutive free cell segment is a key factor. If the longest segment is even, Nayeon loses. If the longest segment is odd and other conditions are met, Nayeon wins. This is because the first player can occupy the middle cell of a long odd sequence to make it symmetric for the second player. If there is no way to play with the longest segment, Tzuyu can copy nayeon's action to make it symmetric so that Tzuyu can always win.\",\n    \"If the longest segment length (z_max) is odd, we must check if any other segment lengths `i` exist where z_max // 2 + 1 <= i < z_max. If such a segment exists, Nayeon loses, because this indicates a strategy that Tzuyu could exploit.\",\n    \"If the dictionary z is empty, it means there are no free cells in the strip (all $A_i = 1$). In this case, Nayeon cannot make any move, so she loses, and the output should be 'No'.\",\n    \"Iterate through the array A. Keep track of the current consecutive free cell count. When you encounter a blocked cell (1), record the count if it's not zero, and reset the count to zero. Store the segment lengths and their frequencies in a dictionary to assist with the determining the winning condition.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
