John has a list A of numbers, indexed 1 to N. He wants to create another list B having N+1 numbers, indexed from 1 to N+1, and having the following property:\\n\\nGCD(B[i], B[i+1]) = A[i],  \u2200 1  \u2264 i  \u2264 N\\n\\nAs there can be many such lists, John wants to know the list B in which sum of all elements is minimum. It is guaranteed that such a list will always exist.\\n\\nInput Format \\n\\nThe first line contains an integer T, i.e., the number of the test cases.

The goal is to minimize the sum of elements in B.\\n- Choosing an Algorithmic Strategy: The key is to realize that B[i] and B[i+1] must have A[i] as their GCD. The minimum values for B[i] and B[i+1] can be achieved by making them small multiples of A[i-1] and A[i] respectively.  Specifically, choosing B[i] and B[i+1] as LCM(A[i-1], A[i]) ensures the GCD is A[i].\\n- Edge Case Considerations: Need to append 1 at the beginning and end of list A to deal with edge cases i=1 and i=N.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Need to calculate LCM(A[i], A[i-1]) for each pair of consecutive elements in A and then construct the list B.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does GCD(B[i], B[i+1]) = A[i] mean in terms of the relationship between elements of array B and A?\",\n    \"If we are trying to minimize the sum of array B, how should we choose the values of B[i] and B[i+1] given A[i]?\",\n    \"What function would be helpful to calculate to determine B[i] such that GCD(B[i], B[i+1]) = A[i]?\",\n    \"Why are we adding 1 to the beginning and end of list A?\",\n    \"How will you format the output for each test case?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"It means that the greatest common divisor of the i-th and (i+1)-th elements of array B is equal to the i-th element of array A.\",\n    \"Since we are trying to minimize array B, we want to find the smallest values possible for B[i] and B[i+1] while maintaining the relationship GCD(B[i], B[i+1]) = A[i].\",\n    \"Calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of adjacent elements A[i] and A[i-1] such that B[i] = LCM(A[i], A[i-1]) is a good approach.\",\n    \"Adding 1 to the beginning and end of list A handles edge cases such that GCD(B[1], B[2]) = A[1] and GCD(B[N], B[N+1]) = A[N]. We set A[0] and A[N+1] to 1.\",\n    \"The output for each test case should be the elements of array B separated by a single space.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
