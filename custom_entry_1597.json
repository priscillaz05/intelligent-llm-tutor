The orchard is divided into H x W plots in the north, south, east, and west directions, and apples, oysters, and oranges are planted in each plot. Mr. Tanaka left such a will.\\n\\nDivide the orchard into as many relatives as possible on a parcel basis. However, if the same kind of fruit is planted in a plot that is located in either the north, south, east, or west direction of a plot, treat them as one large plot because the boundaries of the plot are unknown.\\n\\nFor example, in the following 3 \u00d7 10 section ('li' represents an apple,'ka' represents an oyster, and'mi' represents a mandarin orange)\\n\\n<image>\\n\\n\\nEliminating the boundaries between plots with the same tree gives:\\n\\n<image>\\n\\n\\nIn the end, it will be divided into 10 compartments, or 10 people.\\n\\nThe distribution must be completed before it snows and the boundaries of the plot disappear.

The task is to determine how many distinct plots the orchard can be divided into, considering that adjacent plots with the same fruit type are considered a single plot.\\n- Choosing an Algorithm: The key to solving this problem is to identify connected components of the same fruit. Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) are appropriate algorithms to traverse the grid and group connected fruits of the same type into a single plot.\\n- Implementation Details: Read the input grid. Iterate through each cell of the grid. If a cell contains a fruit that hasn't been visited, increment the plot count and use DFS or BFS to mark all connected cells of the same fruit type as visited.  The use of recursion or a stack/queue (for DFS/BFS) is important for efficiently exploring connected components.\\n- Handling Input and Output: The program must read multiple datasets and terminate when it encounters two lines of zeros. For each dataset, the program calculates and prints the number of distinct plots.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you identify and group adjacent plots with the same type of fruit?\",\n    \"What data structure is most appropriate for representing the orchard map?\",\n    \"Which search algorithm (DFS or BFS) is best suited for identifying connected components, and why?\",\n    \"How do you handle the multiple datasets in the input?\",\n    \"What are the base cases and recursive steps for the DFS approach in this problem?\",\n    \"How would you mark a visited cell to avoid recounting?\",\n    \"What are the space and time complexities of your proposed solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"By using a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to traverse the grid and explore adjacent cells with the same fruit type, effectively grouping them into connected components.\",\n    \"A 2D list (or array) is suitable, where each element represents a plot in the orchard and stores the fruit type as a character ('@', '#', '*').\",\n    \"Either DFS or BFS can be used. DFS might be slightly simpler to implement recursively, while BFS might be preferred if the grid is very large to avoid potential stack overflow issues. The choice depends on constraints and personal preference.\",\n    \"The input is processed inside a while loop that continues until two lines of zeros are encountered. Each iteration reads the dimensions of the grid and the grid itself, calculates the number of plots, and prints the result.\",\n    \"Base cases for DFS include hitting the boundaries of the grid or encountering a different fruit type. The recursive step involves checking the four adjacent cells (north, south, east, west) and recursively calling DFS on cells with the same fruit type.\",\n    \"By modifying the grid in place (e.g., changing the fruit character to a special value, like '.') or using a separate boolean 2D array to keep track of visited cells.\",\n    \"The space complexity is O(H*W) due to the storage of the grid and potential stack space for DFS (worst-case). The time complexity is also O(H*W) because each cell in the grid is visited at most once.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
