Understand that 'simplified' means the fraction is in its lowest terms (numerator and denominator have no common factors other than 1).\\n- Handling Constraints and Edge Cases: Consider the constraint 1 <= n <= 100. Address the case when n = 1, which should return an empty list since no such fractions exist.\\n- Choosing an Algorithm: Opt for a nested loop approach to iterate through all possible numerators and denominators within the given range. Use a set to store decimal representations of the simplified fractions to avoid duplicates.\\n- Simplification Logic: Implement a method to check if a fraction is simplified (e.g., by checking if the numerator and denominator are coprime using the greatest common divisor). Only include the fraction if it's simplified.\\n- Implementation Details: Construct the fraction string (numerator/denominator) and add the corresponding decimal value to the set to prevent duplicates.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for a fraction to be 'simplified,' and how can you check if a fraction is simplified?\",\n    \"What are the key constraints in this problem, and how might they influence your approach?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently avoid generating duplicate fractions in your solution?\",\n    \"What edge cases should be considered, and how will your solution handle them?\",\n    \"Can you explain your approach in terms of time and space complexity?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A simplified fraction is one where the numerator and denominator have no common factors other than 1. To check this, you can compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator. If the GCD is 1, the fraction is simplified.\",\n    \"The main constraint is 1 <= n <= 100, which means I can use a brute-force approach since the range of possible numerators and denominators is relatively small. The constraint also implies that n will always be a positive integer.\",\n    \"I can use a set to store the decimal representation of each fraction. Before adding a new fraction to the result list, I'll check if its decimal representation is already in the set. If it is, then the fraction is a duplicate and should not be added.\",\n    \"The main edge case is when n = 1, in which case I should return an empty list since no fractions satisfy the condition of being between 0 and 1 with a denominator less than or equal to n.\",\n    \"The time complexity is O(n^2 * log(n)), where n is the input number, due to the nested loops and the GCD calculation. The space complexity is O(n^2) in the worst case, as the number of simplified fractions can grow quadratically with n and the set storing the fractions will also grow with the number of fractions.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
