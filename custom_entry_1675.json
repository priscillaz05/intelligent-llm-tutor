In order to achieve this the height of each of the friends should not exceed h. If the height of some person is greater than h he can bend down and then he surely won't be noticed by the guard. The height of the i-th person is equal to a_{i}.\\n\\nConsider the width of the person walking as usual to be equal to 1, while the width of the bent person is equal to 2. Friends want to talk to each other while walking, so they would like to walk in a single row. What is the minimum width of the road, such that friends can walk in a row and remain unattended by the guard?\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and h (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 h \u2264 1000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of friends and the height of the fence, respectively.\\n\\nThe second line contains n integers a_{i} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 2h), the i-th of them is equal to the height of the i-th person.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nPrint a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum possible valid width of the road.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n3 7\\n4 5 14\\n\\nOutput\\n4\\n\\nInput\\n6 1\\n1 1 1 1 1 1\\n\\nOutput\\n6\\n\\nInput\\n6 5\\n7 6 8 9 10 5\\n\\nOutput\\n11\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first sample, only person number 3 must bend down, so the required width is equal to 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.\\n\\nIn the second sample, all friends are short enough and no one has to bend, so the width 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 is enough.\\n\\nIn the third sample, all the persons have to bend, except the last one. The required minimum width of the road is equal to 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 11.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"(n, h) = list(map(int, input().split()))\\narr = list(map(int, input().split()))\\nsum = 0\\nfor i in arr:\\n\\tif i <= h:\\n\\t\\tsum = sum + 1\\n\\tif i > h:\\n\\t\\tsum = sum + 2\\nprint(sum)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understand the Problem: Read the problem statement carefully, paying attention to the conditions under which a person needs to bend down (height > h) and the corresponding width increase (from 1 to 2).\\n- Input Processing: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers: the number of friends (n) and the height of the fence (h). The second line contains n integers, each representing the height of a friend.\\n- Algorithm Selection: Iterate through the heights of the friends. For each friend, check if their height is greater than the fence height (h). If it is, add 2 to the total width; otherwise, add 1.\\n- Edge Cases: Consider cases such as when all friends are shorter than the fence or all friends are taller.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Make sure to correctly parse the input, iterate through the friend's heights, and compute the total width based on the given conditions.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the input parameters and what do they represent?\",\n    \"How should I handle the case where a friend's height is less than or equal to the fence height?\",\n    \"How should I handle the case where a friend's height is greater than the fence height?\",\n    \"What is the expected output and how should it be formatted?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The input parameters are n (the number of friends), h (the height of the fence), and an array of n integers representing the heights of each friend.\",\n    \"If a friend's height is less than or equal to the fence height, the road width increases by 1.\",\n    \"If a friend's height is greater than the fence height, the road width increases by 2 because the friend has to bend down.\",\n    \"The expected output is a single integer representing the minimum width of the road, which is the sum of 1 or 2 for each friend based on their height relative to the fence height.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
