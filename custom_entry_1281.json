You have to construct the squares and rectangles using these sticks. Each unit of a stick can be used as length or breadth of a rectangle or as a side of square. A single unit of a stick can be used only once.\\nLet S be the sum of lengths of all sticks that are used in constructing squares and rectangles. The task is to calculate the maximum possible value of S.\\nNote: The element in array A[] is always unique.\\nExample 1:\\nInput:\\nN = 4\\nA[] = {3,4,6,5}\\nB[] = {2,3,1,6}\\nOutput: \\n38\\nExplanation: \\nThere are 2 sticks of length 3.\\nThere are 3 sticks of length 4.\\nThere is a 1 stick of length 6.\\nThere are 6 sticks of length 5.\\nOne square can be made using 4 sticks of\\n4th kind (5*4=20)\\nA rectangle can be made using 2 sticks of \\n4th kind and 2 sticks of 2nd kind (5*2+4*2=18)\\nS = 20 + 18 = 38\\nExample 2:\\nInput:\\nN = 1\\nA[] = {3}\\nB[] = {2}\\nOutput: \\n0\\nExplanation: \\nThere are only 2 sticks of length 3 which are \\nnot enough to make the square or rectangle.\\nYour Task: \\nYou don't need to read input or print anything.

Sticks can form the sides of squares or the length/breadth of rectangles.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy Selection: Recognize that to maximize the sum, we need to prioritize using as many sticks as possible. Divide the quantity of each stick type by 2 to find how many pairs of sticks are available. Each pair can contribute to either a rectangle or potentially a square.\\n- Optimization and Edge Cases: If there are an odd number of stick pairs after maximizing stick usage, the smallest stick length used in the rectangles should be removed to maximize overall utilization and thus, sum S.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What constitutes a valid shape construction (square or rectangle) from the given sticks, and what are the implications for stick usage?\",\n    \"How does the uniqueness of stick lengths (array A[]) affect the construction of squares and rectangles?\",\n    \"What is the relationship between the quantities of each stick type (array B[]) and the ability to construct shapes?\",\n    \"If the total count of stick pairs is odd, how can you optimize the sum S by considering the smallest stick length used in the rectangles?\",\n    \"Can you explain why dividing each element in B[] by 2 is critical to solving this problem, and how does that result contribute to the overall sum calculation?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A valid shape construction means using either 4 sticks of the same length for a square or 2 pairs of sticks (2 of one length and 2 of another) for a rectangle. Each stick unit can only be used once, so you can't reuse parts of sticks.\",\n    \"Since each stick length is unique, you can't use sticks from different lengths to form squares. However, you can form rectangles using pairs of different stick lengths.\",\n    \"The quantities in array B[] determine how many sticks of each length are available. If B[i] is less than 2, you can't even form a rectangle or contribute to S with that stick length; if B[i] is less than 4, you cannot form a square.\",\n    \"If the total count of stick pairs is odd, it means one pair isn't fully utilized. In this case, you can maximize S by removing the smallest stick length used in the rectangles (which can be found with the smallest A[i] for which B[i]//2 > 0 ) from the sum since that would be the minimal deduction from the overall sum S.\",\n    \"Dividing each element in B[] by 2 determines the number of pairs of sticks available for each length. Multiplying this by 2*A[i] then adds the total length contributed by these stick pairs to the sum S. This leverages the creation of a pair of sticks of same length for rectangle construction and prioritizes rectangle formation over trying to form squares with an odd number of sticks.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
