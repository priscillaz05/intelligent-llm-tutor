Add a small number to x1 and y1 to avoid errors.\\n- Rounding and Accuracy: Understand that the final answer should be rounded to the nearest integer, and that tests will allow a small degree of error.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does a power law distribution work, and what relationship does it imply between x and y?\",\n    \"Given two coordinate pairs (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), how can you determine the power law equation that fits these points?\",\n    \"What considerations should be made for edge cases like x1 or y1 being zero, and how can those cases be handled?\",\n    \"How can you calculate y3 using the power law equation once you have derived it, given x3?\",\n    \"What is the significance of rounding the final answer to the nearest integer, and how does this impact the accuracy of the solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A power law distribution implies that a relative change in one quantity results in a proportional relative change in the other quantity. It often follows the form y = k * x^a, where k and a are constants.\",\n    \"We can use the two given points to solve for the constants in the power law equation. Using the equation y = k * x^a, we can form two equations with two unknowns (k and a) and then solve for them.\",\n    \"If x1 or y1 are zero, it can cause issues with division and logarithms. Adding a tiny amount (e.g. 1e-9) to both x1 and y1 avoids these issues and ensures the calculation proceeds without errors.\",\n    \"Once the power law equation is derived (i.e. the constants are known), substitute x3 into the equation to calculate y3. y3 = k * x3^a.\",\n    \"Rounding to the nearest integer ensures the answer is an integer value and matches the expected output format.
