The input string `S` is always 16 characters long.\\n- Algorithm Selection: Iterate through both strings simultaneously. Compare characters at each index. If they are different, increment a counter. The final counter value is the minimum number of replacements.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Use `zip` to iterate through both strings in parallel. Initialize a counter to 0. The time complexity will be O(n), where n is the length of the strings.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the core requirement of the problem and what needs to be computed?\",\n    \"What algorithm can be used to solve this problem efficiently?\",\n    \"How can we compare the input string with the target string?\",\n    \"What data structure can we use to store the number of character replacements?\",\n    \"What is the expected time complexity of the algorithm?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The problem requires calculating the minimum number of character replacements to transform the input string S into the target string CODEFESTIVAL2016.\",\n    \"We can iterate through both strings and count the number of positions where the characters are different.\",\n    \"We can use `zip` to iterate through both strings in parallel, comparing characters at each index.\",\n    \"An integer variable can be used to store the count of replacements.\",\n    \"The expected time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the string.
