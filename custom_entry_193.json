The number of test cases is between 1 and 100, and the input numbers are between 1 and 100.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Factorials can grow quickly.  Although the input range is small (1-100), a recursive solution could reach the maximum recursion depth, and we must be mindful of possible arithmetic overflows if we were to calculate far larger numbers. Also, make sure to read the input correctly according to the input format.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Use either an iterative or recursive approach to calculate the factorial. Given the input constraints, both approaches are feasible and will complete execution quickly.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Read the input according to the specified format (number of test cases followed by the numbers for which factorials need to be calculated). Handle the base cases (n=0 or n=1) correctly in the factorial function.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the factorial of a number, and how can it be calculated?\",\n    \"Given the input constraints (1 <= n <= 100), is recursion a suitable approach, and why?\",\n    \"How should the input be read and processed according to the problem description?\",\n    \"Are there any specific edge cases to handle in the factorial calculation, and how should they be treated?\",\n    \"How can you ensure that your program handles multiple test cases correctly?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. It can be calculated as n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 2 * 1.\",\n    \"Yes, recursion is suitable because the input numbers are small (up to 100), and this makes it unlikely to exceed maximum recursion depth, and the code to implement is often elegant and readable.\",\n    \"The input should be read first for the number of test cases (t), then a loop should be executed 't' times. In each iteration, a number (n) should be read, and the factorial of n should be calculated and printed.\",\n    \"Yes, the base cases are n=0 and n=1, where the factorial is 1. These must be handled correctly to terminate the recursion or the iterative loop.\",\n    \"The program should read the number of test cases, then iterate through each test case, reading the input number, calculating its factorial, and printing the result within the loop.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
