We know that this section of the route took exactly t seconds to pass.\\n\\nAssuming that at each of the seconds the speed is constant, and between seconds the speed can change at most by d meters per second in absolute value (i.e., the difference in the speed of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed d in absolute value), find the maximum possible length of the path section in meters.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains two integers v_1 and v_2 (1 \u2264 v_1, v_2 \u2264 100) \u2014 the speeds in meters per second at the beginning of the segment and at the end of the segment, respectively.\\n\\nThe second line contains two integers t (2 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the time when the car moves along the segment in seconds, d (0 \u2264 d \u2264 10) \u2014 the maximum value of the speed change between adjacent seconds.\\n\\nIt is guaranteed that there is a way to complete the segment so that:  the speed in the first second equals v_1,  the speed in the last second equals v_2,  the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds doesn't exceed d. \\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nPrint the maximum possible length of the path segment in meters. \\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n5 6\\n4 2\\n\\nOutput\\n26\\nInput\\n10 10\\n10 0\\n\\nOutput\\n100\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first sample the sequence of speeds of Polycarpus' car can look as follows: 5, 7, 8, 6.

Determine how to choose the speeds at each second to maximize the total distance.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Consider using dynamic programming or a greedy approach. The greedy approach involves trying to maximize speed at each second while adhering to constraints.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Account for how to maximize speed from v1 and v2 such that the sum of speeds is greatest, and ensure all the speed increments follow the constraint d.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you calculate the speeds at each second to maximize the distance covered while ensuring the speed difference between consecutive seconds does not exceed d?\",\n    \"What happens if the maximum possible speeds at each second, incrementing by d from v1 and v2, exceed each other?\",\n    \"How should you handle the constraint that the speed at the first second is v1 and at the last second is v2?\",\n    \"Can you explain the greedy approach to maximize the speeds?\",\n    \"How would the solution change if there was no constraint for the difference between adjacent seconds?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"For each second, calculate the maximum possible speed by increasing by d from v1 going forward and from v2 going backward.

To calculate the speeds during a time unit use the smallest speed between the speeds calculated from each end. Repeat this process until you find all the speeds at each second.
