The function should return a list containing the human years, cat years, and dog years.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls:  Need to handle the special cases for the first and second years differently than subsequent years.  Must ensure that the input humanYears is greater than or equal to 1.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy:  Use conditional logic to handle the different calculations for the first year, the second year, and the years thereafter for both cat and dog years.  Store the calculated values in a list.\\n- Implementing Calculation Logic:  Implement the specific formulas provided for cat and dog years, considering the special cases and general calculation. Use a ternary operator to avoid if/else statement.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the base cases for cat and dog years when humanYears is 1?\",\n    \"How do you calculate cat and dog years after the first two years?\",\n    \"How can you handle the conditional calculations efficiently in Python?\",\n    \"What data structure should be used to return the result?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"When humanYears is 1, both cat and dog years are 15.\",\n    \"After the first two years, cat years increase by 4 for each additional year, and dog years increase by 5 for each additional year.\",\n    \"I can use a ternary operator (e.g., `value_if_true if condition else value_if_false`) to handle conditional calculations concisely.\",\n    \"A list should be used to return the result, containing human years, cat years, and dog years in that specific order.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
