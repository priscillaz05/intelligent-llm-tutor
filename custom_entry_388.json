Also, efficiently determining the divisors of a number is crucial.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: An efficient way is to iterate through the array and, for each number, count its divisors. The divisors can be found by iterating up to the square root of the number. If exactly four divisors are found, sum them up.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Optimize the divisor-counting process to avoid unnecessary computations.
