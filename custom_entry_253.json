Attempts to modify it (e.g. to cheat the tests in some way) will likely result in a test crash so it is not recommended for you to modify that section ;)*\\n~~~\\n\\n~~~if:c\\n*NOTE: In C, the* `Node` *struct is placed on top of your main solution (and the [Sample] Test Cases) because the compiler complains about not recognizing the* `Node` *datatype even after adding it to the Preloaded section.  Attempts to modify it (e.g. to cheat the tests in some way) will likely result in a test crash so it is not recommended for you to modify that section ;)*\\n~~~\\n\\nIf you are attempting this Kata in NASM then note that the code example shown directly above may not be relevant; please refer to the Sample Tests (written in C) for the exact definition of the `Node` structure.\\n\\n## Prerequisites\\n\\nThis Kata assumes that you are already familiar with the idea of a linked list.  If you do not know what that is, you may want to read up on [this article on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list).  Specifically, the linked lists this Kata is referring to are **singly linked lists**, where the value of a specific node is stored in its `data`/`$data`/`Data` property, the reference to the next node is stored in its `next`/`$next`/`Next`/`next_node` property and the terminator for a list is `null`/`NULL`/`None`/`nil`/`nullptr`/`null()`. \\n\\n## Task\\n\\n*If you are attempting this Kata in NASM, the code examples shown below may not be relevant at all - please refer to the Sample Tests (written in C) for the exact requirements.*\\n\\nCreate a function `stringify` which accepts an argument `list`/`$list` and returns a string representation of the list.  The string representation of the list starts with the value of the current `Node`, specified by its `data`/`$data`/`Data` property, followed by a whitespace character, an arrow and another whitespace character (`\\\" -> \\\"`), followed by the rest of the list.  The end of the string representation of a list must always end with `null`/`NULL`/`None`/`nil`/`nullptr`/`null()` (all caps or all lowercase depending on the language you are undertaking this Kata in).  For example, given the following list:\\n\\n```python\\nNode(1, Node(2, Node(3)))\\n```\\n\\n... its string representation would be:\\n\\n```python\\n\\\"1 -> 2 -> 3 -> None\\\"\\n```\\n\\nAnd given the following linked list:\\n\\n```python\\nNode(0, Node(1, Node(4, Node(9, Node(16)))))\\n```\\n\\n... its string representation would be:\\n\\n```python\\n\\\"0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 9 -> 16 -> None\\\"\\n```\\n\\nNote that `null`/`NULL`/`None`/`nil`/`nullptr`/`null()` itself is also considered a valid linked list.  In that case, its string representation would simply be `\\\"null\\\"`/`\\\"NULL\\\"`/`\\\"None\\\"`/`\\\"nil\\\"`/`\\\"nullptr\\\"`/`@\\\"NULL\\\"`/`\\\"null()\\\"` (again, depending on the language).\\n\\nFor the simplicity of this Kata, you may assume that any `Node` in this Kata may only contain **non-negative integer** values.  For example, you will not encounter a `Node` whose `data`/`$data`/`Data` property is `\\\"Hello World\\\"`.\\n\\nEnjoy, and don't forget to check out my other Kata Series :D\\n\\n~~~if:fortran\\n*NOTE: In Fortran, your returned string is* **not** *permitted to contain any leading and/or trailing whitespace.*\\n~~~\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def stringify(list):\\n\\treturn 'None' if list == None else str(list.data) + ' -> ' + stringify(list.next)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The task is to convert a linked list into its string representation, following a specified format.
