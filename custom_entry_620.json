Considering all elements incremented by K and all elements decremented by K as base and then iterating to find best optimal split point for minimize difference.\\n- Choosing an Algorithmic Approach: The key idea is to sort the array and then consider two possible scenarios. Either we increment all values less than a certain index and decrement all values greater than or equal to that index, or decrement all values less than a certain index and increment all values greater than or equal to that index. This can be solved using a single loop after sorting.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Edge cases include when K = 0, or when the array is empty.
