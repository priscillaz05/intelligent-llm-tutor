The key is to consider the different possible starting days of the year to determine the minimum and maximum weekend days.\\n- Determining the Calculation Strategy: The number of full weeks in a year (n // 7) contributes a fixed number of weekend days (2 * (n // 7)). The remaining days (n % 7) can result in a varying number of weekend days, depending on where they fall in the week. To minimize weekend days, consider starting the year with weekend days (saturdays and sundays), while to maximize weekend days, consider starting the year with workdays (monday to friday).\\n- Implementing the Solution: The minimum number of weekend days is achieved when the remaining days after full weeks contribute the least number of weekend days. The maximum number of weekend days is achieved when the remaining days contribute the most number of weekend days. We can obtain them when the year begins such that leftover days will contribute the minimum and maximum possible number of weekend days.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does the number of full weeks affect the number of weekend days in a year on Mars?\",\n    \"How do the remaining days (n % 7) affect the minimum and maximum number of weekend days, and what are the possible scenarios?\",\n    \"If a year starts on a weekend day, how does that impact the total number of possible weekend days?\",\n    \"If a year starts on a weekday, how does that impact the total number of possible weekend days?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the minimum and maximum number of weekend days in a Martian year, given the number of days, and the number of days in a work week and weekend?\",\n    \"What edge cases or boundary conditions should you consider to make the solution robust?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Each full week contributes exactly 2 weekend days, so the total number of weekend days from full weeks is 2 * (n // 7).\",\n    \"The remaining days (n % 7) can contribute 0, 1, or 2 weekend days, depending on where they fall within the week. To minimize the number of weekend days, we want to start the year such that the remaining days contribute as few weekend days as possible. To maximize the weekend days, we want the remaining days to be weekend days.\",\n    \"If the year starts on a weekend day, the remaining days will contribute as few weekend days as possible, since any leftover days will be at the beginning of the work week.\",\n    \"If the year starts on a weekday, the remaining days will contribute as many weekend days as possible, since any leftover days will be at the end of the week (weekend).\",\n    \"The minimum number of weekend days is calculated by assuming a start day that minimizes weekend days from n % 7. In our case, we can use  2 * (n // 7) + (n % 7) // 6.
