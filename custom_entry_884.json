Being a dutiful student, he immediately learns how to spell the word.\\n\\nHongcow has decided to try to make new words from this one. He starts by taking the word he just learned how to spell, and moves the last character of the word to the beginning of the word. He calls this a cyclic shift. He can apply cyclic shift many times. For example, consecutively applying cyclic shift operation to the word \\\"abracadabra\\\" Hongcow will get words \\\"aabracadabr\\\", \\\"raabracadab\\\" and so on.\\n\\nHongcow is now wondering how many distinct words he can generate by doing the cyclic shift arbitrarily many times. The initial string is also counted.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line of input will be a single string s (1 \u2264 |s| \u2264 50), the word Hongcow initially learns how to spell. The string s consists only of lowercase English letters ('a'\u2013'z').\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nOutput a single integer equal to the number of distinct strings that Hongcow can obtain by applying the cyclic shift arbitrarily many times to the given string.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\nabcd\\n\\nOutput\\n4\\n\\nInput\\nbbb\\n\\nOutput\\n1\\n\\nInput\\nyzyz\\n\\nOutput\\n2\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nFor the first sample, the strings Hongcow can generate are \\\"abcd\\\", \\\"dabc\\\", \\\"cdab\\\", and \\\"bcda\\\".\\n\\nFor the second sample, no matter how many times Hongcow does the cyclic shift, Hongcow can only generate \\\"bbb\\\".\\n\\nFor the third sample, the two strings Hongcow can generate are \\\"yzyz\\\" and \\\"zyzy\\\".\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"n = input().strip()\\nl = []\\nans = 0\\nfor i in range(len(n)):\\n\\tif n[i:] + n[:i] not in l:\\n\\t\\tl.append(n[i:] + n[:i])\\n\\t\\tans += 1\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tbreak\\nprint(ans)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires determining the number of unique strings that can be generated by cyclically shifting a given string. A cyclic shift involves moving the last character to the beginning.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints: The string length is limited to 50 characters. The string contains only lowercase English letters. We need to avoid counting duplicate cyclic shifts.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: The core idea is to perform cyclic shifts iteratively and store the generated strings in a list or set. Before adding a new shifted string, check if it's already present in the storage. Stop when a duplicate is found, as subsequent shifts will only produce repeating strings.\\n- Implementation Details: Use a `for` loop to iterate through the possible cyclic shifts. In each iteration, generate the shifted string by concatenating the suffix and prefix of the original string. Check for duplicates before adding to the list/set and incrementing the counter.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does a cyclic shift operation entail, and how does it transform the original string?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently track the distinct strings generated to avoid overcounting?\",\n    \"What conditions should terminate the loop to prevent infinite iterations and redundancy?\",\n    \"How do you handle cases where the input string consists of repeating characters, like 'bbb'?\",\n    \"How does the constraint on the string length (1 \u2264 |s| \u2264 50) influence your choice of data structures and algorithms?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A cyclic shift moves the last character of the string to the beginning. For example, 'abcd' becomes 'dabc'.\",\n    \"Use a list or set to store the unique strings. Before adding a new string, check if it already exists in the list/set.\",\n    \"Terminate the loop when a generated string is already in the list/set or when all possible shifts (length of string) have been performed.\",\n    \"In cases like 'bbb', all cyclic shifts result in the same string, so the count will be 1.\",\n    \"The length constraint allows for simpler algorithms and data structures. A list or set with linear search will suffice, as the number of possible strings is limited to 50.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
