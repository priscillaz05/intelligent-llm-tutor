Efficiency is a key concern due to the time limit constraint.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Consider the constraints on 'n' (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10000) and how this affects the choice of algorithm. Recognize that 1 is neither prime nor composite, and 2 and 3 are prime numbers. Need to handle edge cases where n is less than 4.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Explore efficient ways to identify composite numbers. Since n <= 10000, a simple approach of checking divisibility up to the square root of each number can be feasible. Consider using the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which is more efficient for finding multiple primes/composites in a given range.\\n- Implementing Optimization Techniques: Optimize the primality test by only checking divisibility up to the square root of each number. Implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes to precompute primes/composites up to n. Handle output formatting requirements to print space-separated composite numbers.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is a composite number, and how does it differ from a prime number?\",\n    \"What are the time complexity implications of checking each number for compositeness individually versus using an algorithm like the Sieve of Eratosthenes?\",\n    \"How can we optimize the primality test to reduce the computational overhead?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases to consider, especially when n is a small value (e.g., less than 4)?\",\n    \"How can we efficiently construct the list of composite numbers from a precomputed list of primes or using the Sieve of Eratosthenes?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one divisor other than 1 and itself, while a prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.\",\n    \"Checking each number individually has a time complexity of O(n * sqrt(n)), whereas the Sieve of Eratosthenes has a time complexity of O(n log log n), which is more efficient for larger ranges.\",\n    \"We can optimize the primality test by only checking for divisibility up to the square root of the number.
