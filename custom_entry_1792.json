Since we know the depth of the buried treasure and the condition of the strata to be dug, we can reach the buried treasure at the lowest cost with careful planning. So you decided to create a program that reads the condition of the formation and calculates the route to reach the buried treasure depth at the lowest cost.\\n\\nThe state of the formation is represented by cells arranged in a two-dimensional grid, and the position of each cell is represented by the coordinates (x, y). Let the upper left be (1,1), and assume that the x coordinate increases as it goes to the right and the y coordinate increases as it goes deeper down. You choose one of the cells with the smallest y-coordinate and start digging from there, then dig into one of the cells with the largest y-coordinate. There are two types of cells in the formation:\\n\\n1. A cell filled with soil. There is a fixed cost for each cell to dig.\\n2. Oxygen-filled cell. There is no need to dig, and each cell can be replenished with a fixed amount of oxygen. The oxygen in the cell that has been replenished with oxygen is exhausted and cannot be replenished again. Also, when you reach this cell, you must replenish oxygen.\\n\\n\\n\\nOnly left, right, and down cells can be dug from a cell. Once you have dug a cell, you can move it left or right, but you cannot move it up.\\n\\nYou must carry an oxygen cylinder with you when excavating. The moment the oxygen cylinder reaches zero, you will not be able to move, excavate, or replenish oxygen. The remaining amount is decremented by 1 each time you move the cell. Even if the remaining amount of the oxygen cylinder is 0 and the depth of the buried treasure is reached, it is not considered to have been reached. In addition, oxygen can be replenished in cells that have accumulated oxygen, but the excess capacity is discarded.\\n\\nCreate a program that inputs the size of the formation, the excavation cost, the capacity of the oxygen cylinder, the amount of oxygen in the initial state, and the information of the formation, and outputs the minimum cost to reach the deepest cell. However, if the minimum cost exceeds the excavation cost, or if you cannot reach the buried treasure no matter how you dig, please output \\\"NA\\\".\\n\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\nA sequence of multiple datasets is given as input.

The constraints include limited oxygen, digging costs, and movement restrictions (only left, right, and down).\\n- Representing the Grid: The grid can be represented as a 2D array, where each cell contains a value indicating either the digging cost (negative) or the amount of oxygen available (positive).\\n- Defining State: The state should include current position (x, y), remaining oxygen, and which cells in the current row have already been visited, to prevent moving back up. The amount of oxygen needs to be tracked as the excavation happens.\\n- Choosing Algorithm: A dynamic programming (DP) or recursion with memoization approach can be used to explore all possible paths. The DP state will be `dp[x][y][oxygen][visited]`, representing minimum cost to reach (x,y) with `oxygen` remaining given that `visited` nodes are already dug in the current row.\\n- Base Cases: The base cases are reaching the goal (bottom row), running out of oxygen, or exceeding the total excavation cost.\\n- Transitions: From each cell, explore the left, right, and down moves. Update the oxygen level and digging cost accordingly. Avoid moving up and ensure that the oxygen doesn't drop to zero. Cache the result for each state to avoid recomputation.\\n- Handling Oxygen: When entering an oxygen cell, replenish the oxygen up to the cylinder capacity.\\n- Output: If the minimum cost is greater than the maximum excavation cost, output \\\"NA\\\"; otherwise, output the minimum cost.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How should the grid be represented in the code, and what data types should be used to store the digging cost and oxygen values?\",\n    \"What are the base cases for the recursion or dynamic programming algorithm, and what values should be returned in each case?\",\n    \"How can the oxygen level be updated after each move, taking into account both oxygen consumption and replenishment?\",\n    \"How to determine the appropriate DP state considering the possible movements of left, right and down. \",\n    \"How do we keep track of the cells visited so far in one row so as to restrict movement of the digger upwards?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The grid can be represented as a 2D list (list of lists) of integers. Negative values represent digging costs, and positive values represent oxygen amounts. Integer data type is appropriate for both.\",\n    \"The base cases are:\\n1. Reaching the deepest row (y == H-1): Return 0 (no more cost).\\n2. Running out of oxygen (oxygen <= 0): Return infinity (unreachable).\\n3. Exceeding the maximum excavation cost: Return infinity (unreachable).\",\n    \"For each move, subtract 1 from the oxygen level. When entering an oxygen cell, add the oxygen amount to the current oxygen level, but not exceeding the cylinder capacity (m).\",\n    \"The DP state should be `dp[x][y][oxygen][visited]`, representing the minimum cost to reach cell (x, y) with `oxygen` amount of oxygen remaining, given the cells represented by the tuple `visited` has been visited or dug in the current row.\",\n    \"The cells visited so far in the current row can be stored in a boolean array/tuple of the row length. If a cell is already dug in that row then the corresponding element in array is set to True so that during the excavation, there is no movement back up.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
