"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"You were strolling outside the restaurant at the end of the universe. On a metaspiral path you stumble upon a weird device which takes a three-digit number as input and processes it. The Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy explains that it processes the input in the following manner: \\n- Multiplies it with 13, followed by 11 and then 7          \\n- Outputs all the distinct three-digit numbers possible from the digits of the new number (each digit can only be used once)          \\nYour friend Zaphod is in a playful mood, and does the following with the device-           \\n- Given a three-digit positive number $K$, he feeds it to the device for processing.          \\n- He then takes the numbers it gives as output, and send each of them through the device and again collect all the numbers sent out.          \\n- Repeats the above step $N$ times.          \\nTo test your wit, he challenges you to find the number of distinct 3-digit numbers which the device outputs over the $N$ steps. Can you?\\n\\n-----Input:-----\\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\\n- Each testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers $K, N$.\\n\\n-----Output:-----\\nFor each testcase, output a single integer denoting the number of distinct 3-digit numbers which the device outputs over the $N$ steps.\\n\\n-----Constraints-----\\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 1000$ \\n- $5 \\leq N \\leq 10^9$ \\n- Each digit of $K$ is non-zero           \\n\\n-----Sample Input:-----\\n1\\n\\n123 5         \\n\\n-----Sample Output:-----\\n27\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"for _ in range(int(input())):\\n\\ts = input().split()\\n\\tprint(len(set(s[0])) ** 3)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: Recognize that the device multiplies the input by 13, 11, and 7. Realize that the device then outputs all distinct three-digit numbers possible from the digits of the resulting number. Note that the initial input K is a three-digit number with non-zero digits.\\n- Identifying the Key Insight: Notice that after one iteration, the number of distinct three-digit numbers generated depends only on the distinct digits in the product 13 * 11 * 7 * K. Since K has three non-zero digits, and each digit is distinct, after the first operation, the possible three-digit numbers created will only depend on how many distinct digits exist in the product. The subsequent iterations do not change the possible three-digit outputs, because the same digits are being used.\\n- Determining the number of distinct digits: Recognize that since K is a three-digit number with non-zero digits, the resulting digits after multiplying by 13 * 11 * 7 are likely to contain some repetition of the same digits after the first multiplication. The number of possible three-digit output numbers is directly related to the number of distinct digits present in the product after the multiplication.\\n- Calculating the number of distinct three-digit numbers: Understand that the number of distinct digits raised to the power of three represents the maximum possible number of distinct three-digit numbers if all digits are distinct. Since the digits of the input number K are non-zero (1-9), the resulting set of digits after multiplying will consist of digits ranging from 0-9. The solution will calculate the number of distinct digits in the input number and calculate the final output by cubing the number of distinct digits of the input.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the significance of the device multiplying the input K with 13, 11, and 7?\",\n    \"How does the condition that each digit of K is non-zero affect the possible outcomes?\",\n    \"Why does the problem specify that the process is repeated N times?\",\n    \"What determines the set of distinct three-digit numbers that the device can output?\",\n    \"How does the number of distinct digits in the initial input K relate to the final answer?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The multiplication by 13, 11, and 7 serves to scramble the digits of the input K and produce a potentially larger number from which to extract distinct three-digit numbers.\",\n    \"The constraint that each digit of K is non-zero ensures that the initial number is a valid three-digit number with no leading zeros. It primarily affects the initial state, but the subsequent products will dictate the valid digits for forming the distinct three-digit outputs.\",\n    \"The repetition N times is intended to mislead. After the first iteration, the output is solely determined by the number of distinct digits available in the output from the device. Repeating does not influence final distinct digits available to be produced.\",\n    \"The set of distinct three-digit numbers that the device can output is determined by the distinct digits present in the final number obtained after multiplying the initial input K by 13, 11, and 7.\",\n    \"The number of distinct digits in the input K is not relevant. What matters is the number of distinct digits present *after* multiplying K by 13, 11, and 7. The final answer is determined by how many ways we can arrange three digits from those available digits.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
