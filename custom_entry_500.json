Avatar asked Sokka to go to the Southern WarZone from The Northern WarZone and gave him some money in a bag for his journey. Sokka has the World Map to guide him during his journey . The World Map is described as a $N$x$N$ grid where the Northern WarZone is denoted by $(0,0)$ and the Southern WarZone is denoted by $(N-1,N-1)$. Each location on the world map is denoted in a similar way by two integers r and c. For each location having:  \\n- $r = c$ denotes neutral land ( $(0,0)$ and $(N-1,N-1)$ also come under this category)       \\n- $r < c$ denotes the land under the rule of Water Tribes     \\n- $r > c$ denotes the land under the rule of Fire Kingdom   \\nBeing wise Sokka travels only from one location to any other valid location (by valid location we mean a location which exists on the world map grid i.e. for that location $0 \\leq r < N$ and $0 \\leq c < N$ ) just to the right $(r,c+1)$ or below $(r+1,c)$ the current location randomly. Due to the times of war , Sokka has to pay one coin  each time he transitions from one nation to another. Here a transition is counted when Sokka is in Water Tribe land and moves to Fire Nation Land crossing the neutral land or vice versa .The first move is obviously never counted as a transition. Moreover , the coin is to be payed exactly once for one such transition (eg. if he makes this transition k times he has to pay k coins).  \\nThe initial number of coins Sokka has is $2*N$. The probability that the coins he has when he reaches his destination is lesser than the number of coins he started his journey with can be expressed as a fraction $P/Q$, where P and Q are integers $(P \\geq 0, Q > 0)$  and Q is co-prime with $(10^9)+7$. You should compute $P/Q$ modulo $(10^9)+7$ for $T$ values of $N$.\\n\\n-----Input:-----\\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases.

Different regions of the grid represent Water Tribe, Fire Nation, or neutral land. Transitions between Water Tribe and Fire Nation land cost one coin, and Sokka starts with 2N coins.\\n- Identifying the Goal: Calculate the probability that Sokka has fewer than 2N coins when he reaches (N-1, N-1). This probability should be returned modulo (10^9) + 7.\\n- Simplifying the Transition Condition: Notice that a transition only occurs when moving between regions where r < c and r > c.  Neutral land (r = c) does not cause a transition.\\n- Analyzing Paths and Transitions:  Any path from (0,0) to (N-1, N-1) consists of N-1 moves down and N-1 moves right. Determine how to count the number of transitions for a given path.  The number of transitions is related to how many times the path crosses the r=c diagonal from above to below or vice-versa.\\n- Deriving Formula: The number of paths from (0,0) to (N-1, N-1) is given by binomial coefficient C(2N-2, N-1). The only way to have fewer than 2N coins is if the number of transitions is greater than 0, since Sokka starts with 2N coins. Thus, we only need to find out the number of paths which lead to one or more transitions. Also, with 2N initial coins, he can make at most (2N - 1) transitions.\\n- Focusing on the Key Insight: Sokka starts with 2N coins and each transition costs 1 coin.  So the probability we need to calculate is (number of paths with at least one transition) / (total number of paths). Now, we only need to consider paths that cross r=c diagonal *at least* once.\\n- Simplification by considering number of transitions: Notice that number of transitions is zero if and only if Sokka always moves through areas of same sign. That is, all the moves are either in areas where r < c or r > c. Since the path always starts at (0,0) and ends at (N-1, N-1), there is at least one neutral location (r = c). The condition for zero transitions is: the number of paths which doesn't cross the r=c diagonal, except at (0,0) and (N-1, N-1). The number of such path from (1,0) to (N-1,N-1) or (0,1) to (N-1, N-1) is abs(N-1-1) = N-2 right moves and abs(N-1 - 0) = N-1 down moves or vice versa. Therefore number of such paths = combination(N-2 + N-1, N-1) = combination(2N-3, N-1). Similarly, the number of such paths = combination(N-1 + N-2, N-2) = combination(2N-3, N-2) = combination(2N-3, N-1) because C(n,r) = C(n, n-r). Since the total number of paths = combination(2N-2, N-1), the number of paths where transition happens >= 1 = combination(2N-2, N-1) - 2*combination(2N-3, N-1).\\n-  Final Solution for given N: The solution can be further simplified. Since all paths have the same number of transitions after some value, the answer is going to be (n-1)/(n+1) using modular inverse since all paths must pass through the neutral territory at some point.\\n\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the conditions for Sokka to transition from one nation's land to another, and how does this affect the number of coins he has?\",\n    \"Given that Sokka starts with 2N coins, what must be true about the number of transitions for the final number of coins to be less than the initial amount?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently calculate the number of paths from (0,0) to (N-1, N-1) on the grid, and what does each path represent in the context of the problem?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the probability modulo (10^9)+7, considering that you need to divide two potentially large numbers?\",\n    \"Can you identify and handle the edge cases where the probability might be zero or one, and what conditions lead to these cases?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Sokka transitions when moving from Water Tribe land (r < c) to Fire Nation land (r > c) or vice versa, crossing the neutral land (r = c) in between.
