Recognize the need to handle potential large sums by outputting the result modulo 10^9 + 7.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: The constraints suggest a potentially large search space (n <= 10^5), requiring efficient computation. Consider handling edge cases and optimizing the calculation of gcd and lcm to prevent timeouts.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Iterating through all possible combinations of (a, b, c) directly would be inefficient. Consider optimizing based on fixing the gcd of a and b and relating it to the value of c.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Efficiently calculate gcd and lcm. Using Euler's totient function to count coprime pairs can also improve efficiency.

If gcd(a, b) = g, then a = x*g and b = y*g where gcd(x, y) = 1. Given a + b + c = n, then c = n - a - b = n - (x+y)*g. We can iterate through all possible values of 'g' and then find all coprime pairs (x, y) such that (x+y)*g < n. Then lcm(n-(x+y)*g, g) can be added to the total sum.\",\n    \"The number of coprime pairs can be computed using Euler's totient function. The value of Euler's totient function for a number 'n' gives the number of integers less than 'n' that are co-prime to 'n'. You can precompute the totient values using a sieve-like approach for all numbers up to n.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
