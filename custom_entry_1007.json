The Galactik Football Assosiation (GFA) has announced a football tournament between all the teams of all the planets in the galaxy.\\n\\nEach planet of the galaxy has a government. Some governments have a mutual agreement between them. If planet $A$ has mutual agreement with planet $B$, then there is a bidirectional spaceway between $A$ and $B$, using which anybody can go from $A$ to $B$ and vice-versa. People can use these spaceways to travel from one planet to another, if there exists a path between them using some of the spaceways.\\n\\nEach planet has its own football ground. The GFA has planned the matches in such a way that a team can have a match at any of these grounds. The GFA has come across some problems in the execution of their plan. They have found out that there are many pairs of planets between which there does not exist any path, so the football team of one of those planets can't reach the other planet. They requested the corresponding governments to make a spaceway between them, but they can\u2019t because of the absence of a mutual agreement. So the GFA suggested that they will make teleportation devices between some pairs of planets which will be used only by the football teams to travel.\\n\\nBut there are two types of governments in the galaxy\\n1. Some of the governments are greedy and they want to make money through the GFA. Each of these government has asked the GFA for a tax value which it has to pay if it wants to make a teleport ending at their planet.\\n2. Others want to sponsor the event, so they will give money to the GFA if they make a teleport ending at their planet. The GFA would always avoid such governments no matter what the consequences are, because these kind of governments always have some dirty plans up their sleeves.\\n\\nNow, the GFA wants to make bi-directional teleports between planets such that the football teams of any planet can reach any other planet to play a football match, using spaceways between the planets and/or teleports made by the GFA.\\n\\nThe GFA also has financial problems and want to spend as little money as possible. They have come to you so that you can help them calculate the minimum amount of money needed to fulfil their plan.\\n\\n------  Input ------\\nThe first line of the input consists of two space separated integers - $N$ and $M$. $N$ is the number of planets and $M$ is the number of spaceways. The description of the spaceways follows. \\nThe next $M$ lines, each contain two space separated integers $A$ and $B$, denoting a mutual agreement and hence a spaceway to travel, between planet $A$ and planet $B$.\\nThe next $N$ lines each contain a single integer, the integer on the $i^{th}$ line representing $C_{i}$. If $C_{i} \u2265 0$, then it represents the tax value which the GFA has to pay to the government of planet $i$ (it's a type $1$ government). If $C_{i} < 0$, then it represents the money that the $i^{th}$ government will pay to the GFA (it's a type $2$ government).\\n\\n------  Output ------\\nPrint the minimum amount needed for the GFA to fulfil their plan.

Some planets charge a tax for teleports, while others offer money. Type 2 governments (sponsors) should be avoided.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints: All planets must be reachable from each other. Type 2 governments must not be teleport endpoints. The goal is to minimize cost.\\n- Devising an Algorithm: A Disjoint Set Union (DSU) algorithm can efficiently identify connected components. After forming the components, we need to connect them with teleports, avoiding type 2 governments if possible. For each connected component, find the minimum cost (tax or sponsorship) among its planets. Then sum up the costs of connecting the components, minimizing the overall cost.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: If any connected component contains only type 2 governments (sponsors), it's impossible to connect all planets, so return -1. If there is only one connected component, then no teleport is required and the answer should be 0.\\n- Implementation Details: Create a DSU data structure. Iterate through the spaceways and perform union operations to connect planets. Then, iterate through all planets and find the minimum tax/sponsorship for each connected component. Finally, add up the costs. If there are multiple components, connect them by adding the minimum cost for each component and linking the component with the minimum tax with the rest of the components.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you identify the connected components of planets given the spaceways?\",\n    \"How do you handle the two types of governments (taxing and sponsoring) differently in terms of cost?\",\n    \"What data structure is suitable for tracking connected components and efficiently performing union operations?\",\n    \"How do you determine the minimum cost to connect all planets while avoiding sponsorships?\",\n    \"How can you ensure that your solution returns -1 when it's impossible to connect all planets?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The connected components can be identified using a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure. Initially, each planet is its own component. For each spaceway between planets A and B, perform a union operation to merge the components containing A and B.\",\n    \"For taxing governments, the cost is positive and represents the tax that the GFA must pay. For sponsoring governments, the cost is negative, but those governments are avoided (not used as teleport endpoints).\",\n    \"A Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure is well-suited for tracking connected components because it efficiently supports find (to determine which component a planet belongs to) and union (to merge two components) operations.\",\n    \"Find the minimum tax among the planets in each connected component. Then, add up the minimum costs for all connected components except for the component with the overall smallest tax. The total cost to connect all planets is equal to the sum of costs of all the connected component except the one with the overall smallest tax plus (number of connected components -2)* the cost of overall minimum tax. If a component only contains sponsoring governments, then it is not possible to connect all planets.\",\n    \"If, after identifying the connected components, you find any component containing exclusively sponsoring governments, it is impossible to connect all planets. In this case, the solution should return -1.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
