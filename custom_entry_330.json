"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"You just got done with your set at the gym, and you are wondering how much weight you could lift if you did a single repetition. Thankfully, a few scholars have devised formulas for this purpose (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-repetition_maximum)) :\\n\\n\\n### Epley\\n\\n\\n### McGlothin\\n\\n\\n### Lombardi\\n\\n\\nYour function will receive a weight `w` and a number of repetitions `r` and must return your projected one repetition maximum. Since you are not sure which formula to use and you are feeling confident, your function will return the largest value from the three formulas shown above, rounded to the nearest integer. However, if the number of repetitions passed in is `1` (i.e., it is already a one rep max), your function must return `w`. Also, if the number of repetitions passed in is `0` (i.e., no repetitions were completed), your function must return `0`.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def calculate_1RM(w, r):\\n\\tif r == 0:\\n\\t\\treturn 0\\n\\tif r == 1:\\n\\t\\treturn w\\n\\treturn round(max([w * (1 + r / 30), 100 * w / (101.3 - 2.67123 * r), w * r ** 0.1]))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understand the Problem: The function needs to calculate the estimated one-repetition maximum (1RM) based on three different formulas (Epley, McGlothin, and Lombardi).\\n- Handle Edge Cases: If the number of repetitions `r` is 0, return 0. If `r` is 1, it's already a 1RM, so return the weight `w`.\\n- Apply Formulas: Calculate the 1RM using each of the three formulas.\\n- Find the Maximum: Determine the largest 1RM value among the results from the three formulas.\\n- Round and Return: Round the maximum 1RM value to the nearest integer and return it.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the edge cases that I need to consider before applying the formulas, and what should I return in those cases?\",\n    \"Can you briefly explain each of the three formulas (Epley, McGlothin, and Lombardi) and the purpose of each variable in the formulas?\",\n    \"How should I combine the results from the three formulas to get the final result, and what post-processing should I apply to the combined result?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"If the number of repetitions `r` is 0, return 0. If `r` is 1, return the weight `w`.\",\n    \"Epley: `w * (1 + r / 30)`, where `w` is the weight lifted and `r` is the number of repetitions. McGlothin: `100 * w / (101.3 - 2.67123 * r)`.
