One day, the teacher became very angry and decided to give him a very rigorous punishment. He made him stand on the school field which is X axis. \\n\\nUtkarsh initially stood at X = 0. The teacher asked him to run to X = N.  But, to make the process quick, Utkarsh decided that he will make jumps of 2 or 3 steps only, i.e., from X = S he can jump to X = S+2 or X = S+3.\\n\\nUtkarsh decided that he will jump 2 steps with probability P/100 and jump 3 steps with probability 1-P/100.\\n\\nYou need to find the probability that he will reach exactly on X = N.  \\n\\nConstraints:\\n0 < N \u2264 10^6  \\n0 \u2264 P \u2264 100  \\n\\nInput Constraints:\\nThe first line contains two integer N and P.  \\n\\nOutput Constraints:\\nYour answer must contain exactly 6 digits after the decimal point.\\n\\nSAMPLE INPUT\\n5 20\\n\\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\\n0.320000\\n\\nExplanation\\n\\nThere are two ways to reach 5.\\n\\n2+3 with probability =0.2 * 0.8=0.16\\n\\n3+2 with probability =0.8 * 0.2=0.16\\n\\nSo, total probability = 0.32.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"N, P = list(map(int, input().split()))\\nProb = []\\nProb.append(0)\\nProb.append(0)\\nProb.append(P/100)\\nProb.append(1 - Prob[2])\\nfor i in range(4,N+1):\\n\\tProb.append(Prob[i-2]*Prob[2] + Prob[i-3]*Prob[3])\\n\\t\\t\\t\\nprint(\\\"%.6f\\\" %Prob[N])\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem asks for the probability of reaching point N from 0, taking only steps of size 2 or 3. The probability of a step of size 2 is P/100 and size 3 is 1-P/100.\\n- Choosing an Algorithmic Strategy: Dynamic programming can be used where the state Prob[i] represents the probability of reaching point i. The recurrence relation is Prob[i] = Prob[i-2] * (P/100) + Prob[i-3] * (1-P/100).\\n- Identifying Base Cases: Initialize the probabilities for the first few positions. Prob[0] is implicitly 1. However, the code initializes Prob[1] to 0, Prob[2] to P/100, and Prob[3] to 1-P/100. This accounts for starting at position 0.  Prob[i] = 0 for i < 0.\\n- Handling Constraints: N and P are integers within specified ranges. This allows us to use dynamic programming to compute probabilities within a reasonable time.\\n- Optimizing for Output: The output should be formatted to exactly six decimal places.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the problem asking for, and what are the allowed moves?\",\n    \"How can dynamic programming be used to solve this problem, and what does each state represent?\",\n    \"What are the base cases for the dynamic programming approach, and how should they be initialized?\",\n    \"How is the probability calculated at each step, and how does it relate to the probabilities of the previous positions?\",\n    \"How should the final answer be formatted to meet the problem's output constraints?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The problem asks for the probability of reaching position N from position 0 using only jumps of size 2 or 3, where the probability of a jump of size 2 is P/100 and the probability of a jump of size 3 is 1-P/100.\",\n    \"Dynamic programming can be used where Prob[i] represents the probability of reaching position i.
