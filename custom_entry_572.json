Tom has strength $TS$ and Jerry has strength $JS$. You are given $TS$ and your task is to find the number of possible values of $JS$ such that Jerry wins the following game.\\n\\nThe game consists of one or more turns. In each turn:\\nIf both $TS$ and $JS$ are even, their values get divided by $2$ and the game proceeds with the next turn.\\nIf both $TS$ and $JS$ are odd, a tie is declared and the game ends.\\nIf $TS$ is even and $JS$ is odd, Tom wins the game.\\nIf $TS$ is odd and $JS$ is even, Jerry wins the game.\\n\\nFind the number of possible initial values of $JS$ such that $1 \u2264 JS \u2264 TS$, there is no tie and Jerry wins the game.\\n\\n------  Input ------\\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $TS$.\\n\\n------  Output ------\\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \u2015 the number of values of $JS$ such that Jerry wins the game.\\n\\n------  Constraints ------\\n$1 \u2264 T \u2264 10^{5}$\\n$1 \u2264 TS \u2264 10^{18}$\\n\\n------  Subtasks ------\\nSubtask #1 (20 points): $T, TS \u2264 100$\\n\\nSubtask #2 (80 points): original constraints\\n\\n----- Sample Input 1 ------ \\n2\\n\\n1\\n\\n11\\n----- Sample Output 1 ------ \\n0\\n\\n5\\n----- explanation 1 ------ \\nExample case 1: We must have $JS = TS = 1$, but in this case, the game ends and a tie is declared in the first turn.\\n\\nExample case 2: If $JS \\\\in \\\\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\\\\}$, then $JS$ is even and $TS$ is odd, so Jerry wins the game in the first turn.

A tie occurs if both are odd.\\n- Identifying Winning Condition for Jerry: Jerry wins immediately if TS is odd and JS is even. If TS is even, both TS and JS must be repeatedly divided by 2 until TS becomes odd, after which Jerry wins if JS is even at that point.\\n- Counting Winning JS values: Count the number of even numbers between 1 and TS if TS is initially odd. If TS is initially even, reduce TS by repeatedly dividing by 2 until TS becomes odd, then count even numbers.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What conditions must be met for Jerry to win the game in the first turn?\",\n    \"If TS is even, what operations must be performed before determining if Jerry can win?\",\n    \"How can the number of possible values for JS be calculated once TS is odd?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Jerry wins in the first turn if TS is odd and JS is even.\",\n    \"If TS is even, both TS and JS are divided by 2 until TS becomes odd.\",\n    \"Once TS is odd, the number of even numbers from 1 to TS (inclusive) represents the number of JS values for which Jerry wins.
