He has applied to three companies named A, B, and C.\\n\\nYou know Utkarsh's order of preference among these 3 companies, given to you as characters first, second, and third respectively (where first is the company he prefers most).\\n\\nYou also know that Utkarsh has received offers from exactly two of these three companies, given you as characters x and y.\\n\\nUtkarsh will always accept the offer from whichever company is highest on his preference list.
