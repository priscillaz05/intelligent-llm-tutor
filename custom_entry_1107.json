Since Alice is an expert, she decided to play a game, she will give a number $x$ to Bob and will ask some questions:\\nThere will be 4 different kinds of queries:-\\n- \\nAlice gives an integer $i$ and Bob has to report the status of the $i^{th}$ bit in $x$, the answer is $\\\"ON\\\"$ if it is on else $\\\"OFF\\\"$.\\n- \\nAlice gives an integer $i$ and Bob has to turn on the $i^{th}$ bit in $x$.\\n- \\nAlice gives an integer $i$ and Bob has to turn off the $i^{th}$ bit in $x$.\\n- \\nAlice gives two integers $p$ and $q$ and in the binary representation of $x$ Bob has to swap the $p^{th}$ and the $q^{th}$ bits.\\nThe value of $x$ changes after any update operation.\\npositions $i$, $p$, and $q$ are always counted from the right or from the least significant bit.\\nIf anyone of $i$, $p$, or $q$ is greater than the number of bits in the binary representation of $x$, consider $0$ at that position.\\n\\n-----Input:-----\\n- First-line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. \\n- the first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $x, Q$.\\n- $2Q$ lines follow.\\n- first line is an integer, the query type.\\n- for each query of type 1 to 3, there will be the integer $i$\\n- for the query of type 4, there will be two space-separated integers, the integers $p, q$\\n\\n-----Output:-----\\nFor the queries of the first kind, print $\\\"ON\\\"$ or $\\\"OFF\\\"$.\\n\\n-----Constraints-----\\n- $1 \\\\leq T \\\\leq 10^3$\\n- $1 \\\\leq x \\\\leq 10^9$\\n- $1 \\\\leq Q \\\\leq 10^3$\\n- $1 \\\\leq i,p,q \\\\leq 30$\\n\\n-----Sample Input-----\\n1\\n2 2\\n2 \\n1\\n1 \\n1\\n\\n-----Sample Output:-----\\nON\\n\\n-----EXPLANATION:-----\\nthe binary representation of 2 is 10\\nfor query 1, we just have to update x to 11 (or 3 in decimal).\\nfor the next query, x is now 3 or 11 in binary so the answer is ON.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"t = int(input())\\nwhile t > 0:\\n\\t(n, q) = list(map(int, input().split()))\\n\\tblst = [0]\\n\\tfor i in range(1, 65):\\n\\t\\tblst.append(0)\\n\\ti = 1\\n\\twhile n > 0:\\n\\t\\tif n % 2:\\n\\t\\t\\tblst[i] = 1\\n\\t\\tn //= 2\\n\\t\\ti += 1\\n\\twhile q > 0:\\n\\t\\tn = int(input())\\n\\t\\tif n == 1:\\n\\t\\t\\tp = int(input())\\n\\t\\t\\tif blst[p]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprint('ON')\\n\\t\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprint('OFF')\\n\\t\\telif n == 2:\\n\\t\\t\\tp = int(input())\\n\\t\\t\\tif blst[p] == 0:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblst[p] = 1\\n\\t\\telif n == 3:\\n\\t\\t\\tp = int(input())\\n\\t\\t\\tif blst[p] == 1:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblst[p] = 0\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t(p, r) = list(map(int, input().split()))\\n\\t\\t\\tif blst[p] != blst[r]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblst[p] += 1\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblst[p] %= 2\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblst[r] += 1\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblst[r] %= 2\\n\\t\\tq -= 1\\n\\tt -= 1\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the problem: The problem requires simulating bitwise operations on a given number x based on different query types.\\n- Representing the number in binary: The input number x needs to be represented in binary form to access and manipulate individual bits.\\n- Handling different query types: There are four query types: checking the status of a bit, turning a bit on, turning a bit off, and swapping two bits. Each query type requires different operations on the binary representation of x.\\n- Implementing the bitwise operations: Use bitwise operators to efficiently perform the required operations on the binary representation of x.\\n- Managing edge cases: The problem states that if i, p, or q are greater than the number of bits in x, consider 0 at that position.  This needs to be handled correctly.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you represent the integer x in binary format so that you can perform the bitwise operations?\",\n    \"How do you check the status of the i-th bit in x and return \\\"ON\\\" or \\\"OFF\\\"?\",\n    \"How do you turn on the i-th bit in x?\",\n    \"How do you turn off the i-th bit in x?\",\n    \"How do you swap the p-th and q-th bits in x?\",\n    \"How would you handle the condition where i, p, or q is greater than the number of bits in the binary representation of x?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Convert the integer x into its binary representation and store the bits in a list or array. The index of each bit corresponds to its position from the right (least significant bit).\",\n    \"Use the bitwise AND operator to check if the i-th bit is set.
