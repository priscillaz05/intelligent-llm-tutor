In order to protect them, a decision to build a nature reserve has been made.\\n\\nThe reserve must have a form of a circle containing all lairs. There is also a straight river flowing through the forest. All animals drink from this river, therefore it must have at least one common point with the reserve. On the other hand, ships constantly sail along the river, so the reserve must not have more than one common point with the river.\\n\\nFor convenience, scientists have made a transformation of coordinates so that the river is defined by $y = 0$. Check whether it is possible to build a reserve, and if possible, find the minimum possible radius of such a reserve.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^5$) \u2014 the number of animals. \\n\\nEach of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $x_{i}$, $y_{i}$ ($-10^7 \\\\le x_{i}, y_{i} \\\\le 10^7$) \u2014 the coordinates of the $i$-th animal's lair. It is guaranteed that $y_{i} \\\\neq 0$. No two lairs coincide.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nIf the reserve cannot be built, print $-1$. Otherwise print the minimum radius.

The circle represents the nature reserve.\\n- Identifying Constraints: The key constraints are that the circle must contain all points and must be tangent to the x-axis (y=0).  If the animal lairs are on both sides of the x-axis, a solution is impossible.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: The solution uses a ternary search to find the optimal x-coordinate of the circle's center.  The y-coordinate of the center and the radius can then be calculated based on this x-coordinate. A binary search would also be applicable.\\n- Implementing the `cal` function: The `cal` function, given a potential x-coordinate (mid), calculates the minimum radius required to enclose all lairs, given that the circle is tangent to the x-axis. It does this by finding the maximum y-coordinate of the circle's center across all points.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: The code first checks if all y-coordinates have the same sign. If not, it prints -1 and exits, because in that situation there would need to be two intersections with the river.\\n- Optimizing Search: The ternary search narrows down the potential x-coordinate by repeatedly dividing the search interval into thirds and comparing the results from the `cal` function.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the conditions for a feasible solution, and what does it imply about the y-coordinates of the animal lairs?\",\n    \"How does the `cal` function determine the minimum radius required for a given x-coordinate of the circle's center?\",\n    \"Why is ternary search used to find the optimal x-coordinate of the circle's center, and what are its advantages in this context?\",\n    \"How does the code handle the constraint that the circle must be tangent to the x-axis (river)?\",\n    \"What are some potential edge cases or input scenarios that could lead to an infeasible solution, and how does the code address them?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A feasible solution exists only if all y-coordinates of the animal lairs have the same sign (either all positive or all negative). This is because the circle can only touch the x-axis once; if some points are above and some are below, the circle must intersect the river at least twice or not contain all points.\",\n    \"The `cal` function calculates the minimum radius by iterating through all animal lairs and computing the y-coordinate of the circle's center that would be required to include each lair, given the x-coordinate. It then takes the maximum of these y-coordinates. Then since the circle must be tangent to the x-axis, the y coordinate is also equal to the radius.\",\n    \"Ternary search is used because the function `cal(x)` is unimodal. This means that it has a single minimum. Therefore ternary search can be used to find the minimum.\",\n    \"The code ensures tangency by calculating the radius directly from the y-coordinate of the circle's center, given that the circle's bottom-most point must lie on the x-axis (y=0).\",\n    \"An infeasible solution occurs if the y-coordinates of the animal lairs have different signs, which would make it impossible to enclose all points with a circle that is tangent to the x-axis. The code checks for this condition and outputs -1 if it is true. Another case where the solution is impossible is when one of the points are on the river. The problem description states that all y coordinates must be nonzero.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
