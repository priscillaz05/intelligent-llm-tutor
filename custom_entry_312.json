Recognize that if the damage cost (Y) is less than or equal to the maximum rebatable amount (X), the rebate is the damage cost (Y). Otherwise, the rebate is the maximum rebatable amount (X).\\n- Implementing the Solution: Code a solution that reads the input, iterates through each test case, calculates the rebate using the min() function, and prints the result.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you handle multiple test cases in the input?\",\n    \"What happens if the damage cost is less than the maximum rebatable amount?\",\n    \"What happens if the damage cost is greater than the maximum rebatable amount?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently determine the smaller value between the maximum rebatable amount and the damage cost?\",\n    \"What is the purpose of the constraints specified in the problem description?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"You iterate through each test case using a loop (e.g., 'for i in range(t):').\",\n    \"The entire damage cost will be rebated.\",\n    \"Only the maximum rebatable amount will be rebated.\",\n    \"You can use the min() function to find the smaller value.
