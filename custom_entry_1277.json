The operations involve repeatedly removing characters that appear at least twice until all characters are unique.\\n- Identifying Key Strategies: A greedy approach is crucial. We should prioritize keeping larger characters towards the beginning of the string. A stack or similar data structure can help keep track of the characters included in the potential result.\\n- Addressing Implementation Details: The counts of each character are important to determine whether a character can be removed. We also need a boolean array/set to keep track of the characters already included in the result to ensure uniqueness. The removal process must also consider the lexicographical order.\\n- Optimizing for Lexicographical Order: While scanning the input string from left to right, the algorithm should consider removing smaller characters already present in the result if there are duplicates further down the string, and replacing them with larger ones to maximize the lexicographical order.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for a string to be lexicographically maximal, and how does it relate to the order of characters in the string?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: A string is lexicographically maximal if it is the largest possible string among all possible strings after performing the allowed operations. This means characters should be arranged so that the largest characters appear as early as possible.\",\n    \"How can you efficiently keep track of the characters that have already been included in the result string to ensure uniqueness?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: A boolean array (or set) can be used to keep track of whether a character has been included or not. This allows for quick checking and avoids adding duplicate characters.\",\n    \"How do you determine if a character at a particular index can be removed, and what criteria must be met?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: A character can be removed if it appears at least twice in the remaining part of the string. Maintaining counts for each character is important for this determination.\",\n    \"In what order should you process the input string to maximize the lexicographical order of the resulting string, and why is this order important?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: Processing the input string from left to right is essential. This is because characters closer to the beginning of the string have more weight in determining lexicographical order.
