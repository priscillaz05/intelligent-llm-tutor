Jerry goes first, and the player who cannot make a move loses. The task is to determine who wins assuming both play optimally.\\n- Identifying the Winning Condition: Jerry wins if he can force Tom into a position where Tom cannot make a move (i.e., the number of marbles is less than both M1 and M2 when it's Tom's turn).\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Analyze the game using modular arithmetic. Notice that if N % (M1 + M2) < M1, Tom cannot make a move after a certain sequence of moves. Therefore, the result depends on the remainder of N when divided by (M1 + M2).\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Consider the edge case where M1 is 0. If M1 is 0, then Jerry can always win by removing M2 until N < M2.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for a player to play optimally in this context?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: It means each player makes the best possible move at each turn to maximize their chances of winning, assuming the other player also plays optimally.\",\n    \"If N is less than both M1 and M2, who wins, and why?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: Tom wins because Jerry cannot make any move on the first turn.\",\n    \"What if M1 is 0? How does that change the game?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: If M1 is 0, Jerry can keep removing M2 until the remaining marbles is less than M2. In this case, Jerry wins as Tom will never be able to make a move.\",\n    \"How can you determine the winner by analyzing the remainder when N is divided by (M1 + M2)?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: If the remainder is less than M1, then Tom loses after a certain sequence of moves and Jerry wins. Otherwise, if the remainder is equal to or larger than m2 then the Jerry wins because jerry can make at least one move. If the remainder is equal to m1 then also jerry wins.\",\n     \"Can the condition (T*N < 10000000) affect the choice of an algorithm?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: No, it mainly suggests the program can run in time as there is not too many tests. The goal is still to come up with a efficient and correct solution.\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": []\n}\n```"
