The answer should be modulo $10^9 + 7$.\\n- Constraints and Input: Consider the constraints on the number of queries (q), the size of the input array (n), and the range of values in the array (3500 to 4500). The input involves reading the number of queries, the size of each array, and the array elements themselves.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: The number of possible multisets can grow exponentially, leading to large computations. Ensure modular arithmetic is correctly applied to keep the results within the required range. Efficient algorithms are needed due to the large input size.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Consider using dynamic programming or number theory techniques to efficiently count the multisets. Consider the limitations of basic prime checking algorithms due to constraints and look for optimizations.\\n- Implementation Details: Ensure that all values are taken modulo $10^9 + 7$ to prevent overflow. Handle edge cases, such as an empty array or cases where no valid multisets can be formed. Optimize the prime number generation and checking.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: When no elements are chosen for a multiset, the XOR is 0 which is not prime. Therefore, this case should not be counted.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you efficiently determine if a number is prime within the given constraints, especially given that numbers can be up to 8191 (the maximum XOR value)?\",\n    \"What approach would you take to count the number of valid multisets such that the XOR sum is a prime number, considering the multiset can contain duplicate elements?\",\n    \"How would you handle the modulo operation ($10^9 + 7$) to ensure the result does not overflow during intermediate calculations?\",\n    \"What data structure is most suitable for storing the counts of each unique number within the array, and why?\",\n    \"How would dynamic programming be applied to solve this problem, especially in tracking the number of multisets that XOR to a particular value?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Since the maximum XOR value is capped at 8191, we can precompute a list of primes using the Sieve of Eratosthenes or a similar method. This allows for O(1) primality checking by simply looking up if a number is in the precomputed list.\",\n    \"We can use dynamic programming. Let dp[i][j] be the number of multisets formed using the first i numbers from the array, where the XOR sum is j. Initialize dp[0][0] = 1. For each number a[i], we have two choices: either include it in the multiset or not. If we include it, dp[i+1][j ^ a[i]] += dp[i][j]. If we don't, dp[i+1][j] += dp[i][j]. After filling the table, sum up the values dp[n][p] for all primes p to find the total number of valid multisets.\",\n    \"Apply the modulo operation after every arithmetic operation, such as addition and multiplication. This keeps intermediate values small and prevents overflow. For example, instead of (a + b) % MOD, calculate (a % MOD + b % MOD) % MOD. Similarly, for multiplication, (a * b) % MOD is equivalent to ((a % MOD) * (b % MOD)) % MOD.\",\n    \"A Counter (from the collections module) is ideal for storing counts of each unique number. It efficiently tracks the frequency of each number and simplifies the process of iterating through unique numbers and their corresponding counts.\",\n    \"Dynamic programming can be used to track the number of multisets with a given XOR value. The state dp[i][x] represents the number of multisets formed using the first i elements of the array with a XOR sum of x. The transition involves considering whether to include the i-th element in the multiset or not. The base case is dp[0][0] = 1, and the final answer involves summing dp[n][p] for all prime numbers p.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
