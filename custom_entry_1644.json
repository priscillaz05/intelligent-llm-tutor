The goal is to maximize the sum of the first and last element of the rotated array.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: The array length can be large (up to 10^5). The naive solution of rotating the array and calculating the sum for each rotation would be too slow. We need an approach that avoids actual rotations. Note that the sum of first and last elements is important.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Notice that after each rotation, the last element becomes the first element, and the second to last becomes the last element. Therefore, keep track of the maximum of adjacent pairs. Also calculate the sum of the original first and last elements.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Handle edge cases where n=2, in which case the answer is always a[0] + a[1]. Use a variable to store the current maximum sum and update this when a larger sum is found.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the constraints on the input size, and how do these constraints impact the choice of algorithm?\",\n    \"How does right rotating the array affect the first and last elements, and how can we leverage this to optimize the search for the maximum sum?\",\n    \"Can we avoid actually performing rotations and directly calculate the maximum possible sum of the first and last elements after different rotations?\",\n    \"What edge cases should be considered, and how will these cases affect the code's behavior?\",\n    \"How would you efficiently keep track of the maximum sum of A[1] + A[N] while iterating or computing possible rotations?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The constraints are T <= 1000, 2 <= N <= 10^5, and 1 <= A[i] <= 10^9. The large N restricts us from performing rotations explicitly, as that would be O(N^2). We need to find a more efficient approach.\",\n    \"Each right rotation makes the last element the new first element and the second to last element the new last element. We can observe that we are essentially considering the sums of all adjacent pairs in the original array and the sum of first and last element. This can be used to avoid actual rotations and simply check the sum of all such pairs.\",\n    \"Yes, instead of rotating, we can compute the sums of all adjacent pairs (A[i] + A[i+1] where i+1 wraps around). The maximum of all such sums is the answer.\",\n    \"If N is 2, we simply return A[0] + A[1].\",\n    \"I can keep track of the maximum sum using a variable initialized to a small value. As I compute the sum of each possible A[1] + A[N] after rotation, I compare it with the current maximum and update the maximum if the new sum is larger.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
