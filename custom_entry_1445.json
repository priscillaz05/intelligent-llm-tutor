Yesterday he had enumerated the nodes of the tree in such a way: \\n- Let's call the nodes' level a number of nodes that occur on the way to this node from the root, including this node. This way, only the root has the level equal to 1, while only its two sons has the level equal to 2.\\n- Then, let's take all the nodes with the odd level and enumerate them with consecutive odd numbers, starting from the smallest levels and the leftmost nodes, going to the rightmost nodes and the highest levels.\\n- Then, let's take all the nodes with the even level and enumerate them with consecutive even numbers, starting from the smallest levels and the leftmost nodes, going to the rightmost nodes and the highest levels.\\n- For the better understanding there is an example: \\n1\\n/           \\\\\\n2                   4\\n/   \\\\                /       \\\\\\n3       5           7        9\\n/ \\\\      /  \\\\          /  \\\\       /  \\\\\\n6  8 10 12      14 16   18 20 \\n\\nHere you can see the visualization of the process. For example, in odd levels, the root was enumerated first, then, there were enumerated roots' left sons' sons and roots' right sons' sons.\\nYou are given the string of symbols, let's call it S. Each symbol is either l or r. Naturally, this sequence denotes some path from the root, where l means going to the left son and r means going to the right son.\\nPlease, help Chef to determine the number of the last node in this path.\\n\\n-----Input-----\\nThe first line contains single integer T number of test cases.\\nEach of next T lines contain a string S consisting only of the symbols l and r.\\n\\n-----Output-----\\nPer each line output the number of the last node in the path, described by S, modulo 109+7.\\n\\n-----Constraints-----\\n- 1 \u2264 |T| \u2264 5\\n- 1 \u2264 |S| \u2264 10^5\\n- Remember that the tree is infinite, so each path described by appropriate S is a correct one.\\n\\n-----Example-----\\nInput:\\n4\\nlrl\\nrll\\nr\\nlllr\\nOutput:\\n10\\n14\\n4\\n13\\n\\n-----Explanation-----\\nSee the example in the statement for better understanding the samples.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"for t in range(int(input())):\\n\\ts = input()\\n\\tn = 1\\n\\tfor i in range(len(s)):\\n\\t\\tif i % 2 == 0:\\n\\t\\t\\tif s[i] == 'l':\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tn = n * 2\\n\\t\\t\\tif s[i] == 'r':\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tn = n * 2 + 2\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tif s[i] == 'l':\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tn = n * 2 - 1\\n\\t\\t\\tif s[i] == 'r':\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tn = n * 2 + 1\\n\\tprint(n % (10 ** 9 + 7))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem describes a complete binary tree with a specific numbering scheme based on levels and left/right positions. The task is to find the node number reached by a given path (string of 'l' and 'r'). The numbering alternates between odd and even levels.\\n- Devising a Strategy: The core idea is to simulate the path through the tree, updating the node number at each step according to whether the current level is odd or even. The provided examples give clues as to how to update the node number. The key observation is that left and right movements on odd and even levels have different effects on the node number.\\n- Implementing the Solution: Initialize the node number to 1 (the root). Iterate through the path string. In each iteration, check if the level (represented by the index i in the path string) is odd or even. Based on whether it's 'l' or 'r', update the node number using the given rules. Finally, return the result modulo 10^9 + 7.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does the node numbering scheme change between odd and even levels?\",\n    \"How do 'l' and 'r' movements affect the node number on odd levels?\",\n    \"How do 'l' and 'r' movements affect the node number on even levels?\",\n    \"Why is the modulo operation (10^9 + 7) necessary?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"On odd levels, nodes are numbered with consecutive odd numbers, while on even levels, nodes are numbered with consecutive even numbers.\",\n    \"On odd levels:\\n  - Moving 'l' (left) means the node number is updated as n = n * 2.\\n  - Moving 'r' (right) means the node number is updated as n = n * 2 + 2.\",\n    \"On even levels:\\n  - Moving 'l' (left) means the node number is updated as n = n * 2 - 1.\\n  - Moving 'r' (right) means the node number is updated as n = n * 2 + 1.\",\n    \"The modulo operation is necessary to prevent integer overflow since the node numbers can become very large.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
