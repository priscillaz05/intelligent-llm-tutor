Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths \u2013 from a base to its assigned spaceship \u2013 do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 \u2264 R, B \u2264 10). For 1 \u2264 i \u2264 R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers x_{i} and y_{i} (|x_{i}|, |y_{i}| \u2264 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases.

The non-intersection constraint is about pairs of assignments. If lines cross, it leads to collision risk and \\\"No\\\" output, otherwise, \\\"Yes\\\" is printed if perfect matching is possible.\\n- Selecting Algorithmic Strategy: First, verify R equals B. If not, no perfect matching is possible. If yes, then check for intersection conditions. A brute-force approach would involve considering all possible perfect matchings and then checking for intersections for each matching.  To check for intersections, the program iterates through all pairs of assignment lines to find if they intersect. The crucial check is seeing if three points are on the same line. If any such combination exists, then the overall matching is considered to create intersections and hence is considered invalid.\\n- Implementing Intersection Checks: Determining if two line segments intersect can be done by checking if the orientation of the endpoints of each segment with respect to the other segment changes. This involves cross-product calculations to determine orientations.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the most important condition to check before trying to find any perfect matchings of spaceships and bases?\",\n    \"How can you detect if two line segments in a 2D plane intersect?\",\n    \"If R and B are equal, does that automatically guarantee a 'Yes' output? If not, why not?\",\n    \"What are some possible perfect matchings for R=2, B=2? \",\n    \"Given two line segments, how does the cross-product help determine if they intersect?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The most important condition is to check if R equals B. If they are not equal, a perfect matching is impossible, and the output should be 'No'.\",\n    \"One way to detect if two line segments intersect is to use cross-product calculations to determine the orientations of the endpoints of each segment with respect to the other segment. If the orientations change for both segments, then they intersect.\",\n    \"No, even if R and B are equal, it doesn't guarantee a 'Yes' output. The constraint about no two paths intersecting must also be satisfied.  Even with a perfect matching, the line segments connecting assigned spaceships and bases can intersect.\",\n    \"If R=2 and B=2, and the spaceships are s1 and s2, and the bases are b1 and b2, then two perfect matchings are possible: (s1-b1, s2-b2) and (s1-b2, s2-b1).  Each of these would then need to be tested for intersecting paths.\",\n    \"The cross-product allows determining the orientation of three points. If the cross-product (or its z-component) changes sign when considering endpoints of one line segment relative to the other, it suggests that the points lie on opposite sides of the line, indicating a possible intersection. The sign of the cross product indicates whether a point is to the left or right of a directed line segment.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
