If an element appears only once, its gap is 0.\\n- Choosing a data structure: A dictionary can be used to store the first index of each element. This allows for efficient lookup.\\n- Algorithmic strategy: Iterate through the array. If an element is not in the dictionary, add its index to the dictionary. If the element is already in the dictionary, calculate the difference between the current index and the first index stored in the dictionary, and update the maximum gap found so far.\\n- Handling edge cases: If no element appears more than once, the maximum gap will remain at its initial value which is negative infinity, so return 0 in this case.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the meaning of gap in this context and how do you calculate it?\",\n    \"What data structure would you use to efficiently store the first index of each number, and why?\",\n    \"How would you handle the edge case where the maximum gap is never updated (i.e., no element appears more than once)?\",\n    \"Can you explain the time complexity and space complexity of your proposed solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Gap is defined as the difference between the last and first index of a number, assuming 0-based indexing.  So, if a number first appears at index 'i' and last appears at index 'j', the gap is j-i.\",\n    \"I would use a dictionary (hash map) to store the first index of each number. This allows me to check if a number has already appeared and retrieve its first index in O(1) average time complexity.\",\n    \"If no element appears more than once, then the maximum difference will still be the initial value which is negative infinity. I should then return 0.\",\n    \"The time complexity of the solution is O(N) because we iterate through the array once. The space complexity is O(N) in the worst case, as the dictionary could potentially store all unique elements of the array.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
