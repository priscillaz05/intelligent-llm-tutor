Kolya will put them in the juicer in the fixed order, starting with orange of size a_1, then orange of size a_2 and so on. To be put in the juicer the orange must have size not exceeding b, so if Kolya sees an orange that is strictly greater he throws it away and continues with the next one.\\n\\nThe juicer has a special section to collect waste. It overflows if Kolya squeezes oranges of the total size strictly greater than d. When it happens Kolya empties the waste section (even if there are no more oranges) and continues to squeeze the juice. How many times will he have to empty the waste section?\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line of the input contains three integers n, b and d (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000, 1 \u2264 b \u2264 d \u2264 1 000 000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of oranges, the maximum size of the orange that fits in the juicer and the value d, which determines the condition when the waste section should be emptied.\\n\\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 1 000 000)\u00a0\u2014 sizes of the oranges listed in the order Kolya is going to try to put them in the juicer.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nPrint one integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of times Kolya will have to empty the waste section.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n2 7 10\\n5 6\\n\\nOutput\\n1\\n\\nInput\\n1 5 10\\n7\\n\\nOutput\\n0\\n\\nInput\\n3 10 10\\n5 7 7\\n\\nOutput\\n1\\n\\nInput\\n1 1 1\\n1\\n\\nOutput\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first sample, Kolya will squeeze the juice from two oranges and empty the waste section afterwards.\\n\\nIn the second sample, the orange won't fit in the juicer so Kolya will have no juice at all.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"(n, b, d) = list(map(int, input().split()))\\nl = list(map(int, input().split()))\\nc = 0\\ntw = 0\\nfor i in l:\\n\\tif i > b:\\n\\t\\tcontinue\\n\\ttw += i\\n\\tif tw > d:\\n\\t\\tc += 1\\n\\t\\ttw = 0\\nprint(c)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem describes a scenario where oranges are squeezed into a juicer. Oranges larger than 'b' are discarded. The juicer's waste section overflows when the total size of squeezed oranges exceeds 'd'. The task is to count how many times the waste section is emptied.\\n- Identifying Key Variables: 'n' is the number of oranges, 'b' is the maximum size of an orange that can be squeezed, 'd' is the waste section capacity, and the list 'a' contains the sizes of the oranges.\\n- Algorithmic Approach: Iterate through the oranges, check if each orange's size is within the limit 'b'. If it is, add it to the current waste size. If the waste size exceeds 'd', increment the empty count and reset the waste size to 0.\\n- Edge Cases: Consider the case where no oranges fit in the juicer or the waste section never overflows.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the constraints on the sizes of n, b, and d, and how might these constraints influence your solution?\",\n    \"How do you handle oranges that are too large to be put in the juicer?\",\n    \"How do you keep track of the total waste and the number of times the waste section is emptied?\",\n    \"What happens if no oranges are squeezed at all?\",\n    \"Could the value of d be very large, such that the waste section never overflows, and how would that affect the output?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The constraints (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100000, 1 \u2264 b \u2264 d \u2264 1000000) indicate that the input size can be large, potentially requiring efficient iteration. Also, b and d are within a manageable range, which shouldn't cause integer overflow issues with standard data types.\",\n    \"If an orange's size is greater than b, you should skip it and not add it to the total waste.\",\n    \"You can use a variable to accumulate the total waste and another variable to count the number of times the waste section is emptied. After processing each orange (that fits), check if the total waste exceeds d. If it does, increment the empty count and reset the total waste to zero.\",\n    \"If no oranges are squeezed (either because all are too large or there are no oranges), the waste section will never be emptied, so the output should be 0.\",\n    \"Yes, if d is very large compared to the orange sizes, the waste section might never overflow. In this case, the empty count will remain 0.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
