This needs to be done efficiently.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: A naive approach of comparing every pair of indices would be O(n^2), which is not efficient enough considering the constraint 1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^{6}. Need to consider how to optimize the search process.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Consider using two pointers, one starting from the beginning (i) and one from the end (j). For each i, find the largest possible j such that arr[i] <= arr[j].\\n- Implementation Considerations: While incrementing i, for each i start j from end. Move j to the left until the condition arr[i] <= arr[j] becomes true.
