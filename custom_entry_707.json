The players have been given points for scoring goals and points for committing fouls. Now, it is up to Alex to find the best player in the tournament. As a programmer, your job is to help Alex by telling him the highest number of points achieved by some player.\\n\\nYou are given two sequences $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\\\ldots, A_{N}$ and $B_{1}, B_{2}, \\\\ldots, B_{N}$. For each valid $i$, player $i$ scored $A_{i}$ goals and committed $B_{i}$ fouls. For each goal, the player that scored it gets $20$ points, and for each foul, $10$ points are deducted from the player that committed it. However, if the resulting number of points of some player is negative, this player will be considered to have $0$ points instead.\\n\\nYou need to calculate the total number of points gained by each player and tell Alex the maximum of these values.\\n\\n------  Input ------\\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.

If a player's total points are negative, their score is considered 0.\\n- Handling Multiple Test Cases: The input contains multiple test cases, so the solution needs to iterate through each test case.\\n- Finding the Maximum Score: For each test case, calculate each player's score and keep track of the maximum score achieved.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you handle the case where a player's total points are negative?\",\n    \"How do you iterate through the multiple test cases provided in the input?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the total points for each player based on goals and fouls?\",\n    \"How do you determine the maximum score among all players for each test case?\",\n    \"What data types are most suitable for storing the number of goals, fouls and the resulting point?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"If a player's total points are negative, you should set their score to 0 before comparing it with the current maximum score.\",\n    \"You iterate through the test cases using a loop that runs 'T' times, where 'T' is the number of test cases provided in the input.\",\n    \"The total points for each player is calculated as (goals * 20) - (fouls * 10).\",\n    \"For each test case, maintain a variable to track the maximum score encountered so far. Initialize it to 0.
