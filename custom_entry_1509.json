Overlapping is allowed if the end of one string matches the beginning of another. The goal is to find the optimal combination of strings and overlaps to minimize the final length.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: The number of strings is limited to 8, which means we can potentially explore all possible permutations of the input strings. This limitation guides the choice of a brute-force approach. Consider edge cases, such as when no overlaps are possible between strings, or when one string is entirely contained within another.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: The most suitable approach here is to try all possible permutations of the input strings and, for each permutation, try to overlap the strings greedily. Calculate the length of the resulting merged string and keep track of the minimum length found so far.\\n- Implementing Overlap Logic: For each permutation, iterate through the strings, attempting to overlap the current string with the accumulated merged string. Find the maximum possible overlap between the end of the merged string and the beginning of the current string. If no overlap is found, append the current string to the merged string. The length calculation must consider the characters added not the total.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the main objective of this problem, and what are we trying to minimize?\",\n    \"What constraints are given in the problem, and how might they influence the choice of algorithm?\",\n    \"Can you describe a strategy to find the shortest possible merged string, given the constraints and objectives?\",\n    \"When overlapping two strings, how do you determine the amount of overlap, and how does it affect the total length?\",\n    \"What edge cases or special conditions should you consider when solving this problem, and how might they affect your approach?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The main objective is to minimize the final length of the string after merging the given N strings by overlapping them as much as possible.\",\n    \"The constraint is that N is between 1 and 8. Because N is small, a brute-force approach that tries all possible permutations might be feasible.\",\n    \"A reasonable strategy would be to generate all possible permutations of the N strings. For each permutation, greedily merge the strings by finding the largest overlap between consecutive strings. Keep track of the minimum length obtained across all permutations.\",\n    \"To determine the amount of overlap, you need to find the largest suffix of the first string that matches the prefix of the second string. The length of the merged string will be the sum of the lengths of the two strings minus the length of the overlap.\",\n    \"Edge cases to consider include when there is no overlap between two consecutive strings (in which case they are simply concatenated) or when one string is entirely contained within another (in which case the length doesn't change after the merge).\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
