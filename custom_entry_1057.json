You should not break any stick, but you can link them up, and each matchstick must be used exactly one time.\\n\\n Your input will be several matchsticks the girl has, represented with their stick length.

Each stick must be used exactly once.\\n- Handling Invalid Inputs: Check if the number of matchsticks is less than 4, as a square requires at least 4 sides. Verify if the total length of all matchsticks is divisible by 4, because all sides of the square must be equal in length. If these initial conditions are false, then immediately return false.\\n- Calculating Side Length: Calculate the required side length of the square by dividing the total length of all sticks by 4.\\n- Employing Backtracking/DFS: Implement a backtracking or DFS algorithm to recursively check if a valid combination of matchsticks can be found for each side of the square. Keep track of which sticks have already been used. Optimize by sorting the matchsticks in descending order to potentially prune the search space earlier.\\n- Early Pruning: If at any point the length of the longest stick exceeds the side length, the solution is impossible because that stick can't be part of any side, return false immediately.\\n- Base Case: If all four sides can be formed using the matchsticks (i.e., the recursive calls return true for all sides), then return true; otherwise, return false.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you validate that a square can possibly be made before even starting the combinations?\",\n    \"What is the best way to keep track of which matchsticks you\u2019ve already used so you don\u2019t use them more than once?\",\n    \"How do you efficiently explore possible matchstick combinations to construct each side of the square? Should you consider any specific search strategies or optimizations?\",\n    \"How do you handle the base case in your backtracking/DFS approach to determine if a square can be successfully formed?\",\n    \"What kind of optimization you can do for this problem?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Before diving into combinations, validate the input. Ensure there are at least four matchsticks and the total length of the matchsticks is divisible by four. If not, a square cannot be formed.\",\n    \"Use a set to keep track of the indices of the matchsticks that have already been used. Before considering a matchstick, check if its index is in the used set. If it is, skip it.\",\n    \"Implement a backtracking or DFS strategy to explore matchstick combinations. Sort the matchsticks in descending order to prioritize longer sticks, which could help prune the search space earlier. During each recursive call, keep track of the current side length and the remaining target length.\",\n    \"The base case is reached when all four sides of the square have been successfully formed. This is equivalent to completing four rounds of stick selection where each side reaches the target length. If this condition is met, return true. Otherwise, if no combination yields a square, return false.\",\n    \"Sort the matchsticks in descending order to prioritize longer sticks, which could help prune the search space earlier.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
