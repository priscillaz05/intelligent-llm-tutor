The coverage for a zero is the number of adjacent ones (up, down, left, right). \\n- Choosing an Approach: Iterate through each cell in the matrix. If the cell is zero, check its four neighbors. If a neighbor exists and is equal to one, increment a running total. \\n- Handling Edge Cases: Ensure boundary conditions are handled, i.e., avoid checking neighbors that are outside the matrix bounds.\\n- Optimizing for Space: The solution should be O(1) space, meaning no extra data structures should be created that scale with the input size.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does 'coverage' mean in this context, and how should it be calculated for each zero in the matrix?\",\n    \"How should the algorithm handle cases where a zero is located at the edge of the matrix or near the boundary, so it doesn't try to access elements out of bounds?\",\n    \"What is the optimal space complexity for this problem, and how can we achieve it?\",\n    \"What is the time complexity of the proposed solution, and why?\",\n    \"If the matrix is very large, are there any potential optimizations to consider to reduce the number of operations or memory accesses?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Coverage refers to the number of adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) that contain a '1' for a given cell containing a '0'.\",\n    \"The algorithm should include boundary checks before accessing neighboring cells to ensure that it does not attempt to read outside of the matrix dimensions. Conditions like `i - 1 >= 0`, `i + 1 < len(matrix)`, `j - 1 >= 0`, and `j + 1 < len(matrix[0])` should be checked.\",\n    \"The optimal space complexity is O(1), which means the algorithm should use a constant amount of extra memory, regardless of the size of the matrix. This can be achieved by simply using a variable to accumulate the coverage total and not using any data structures dependent on the size of the input matrix.\",\n    \"The time complexity of the proposed solution is O(n*m), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns in the matrix, since we iterate through each cell once.\",\n    \"For very large matrices, potential optimizations could involve parallel processing or using techniques to reduce the number of conditional checks within the inner loop, but the fundamental O(n*m) complexity would remain.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
