Note the doubly-linked list is sorted and contains distinct elements.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Consider the edge case where no pairs sum to the target value (return an empty list). Be mindful of using constant space and linear time complexity.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Opt for the two-pointer approach due to the sorted nature of the list, where one pointer starts from the head and the other from the tail. Move the pointers accordingly based on whether their sum is less than, greater than, or equal to the target.\\n- Implementing Two-Pointer Movement: Start one pointer at the head and the other at the tail of the doubly linked list. Iterate while the 'head' pointer is before the 'tail' pointer. If the sum of the two pointers' values equals the target, add the pair to the result and move both pointers. If the sum is less than the target, advance the 'head' pointer. Otherwise, move the 'tail' pointer backward.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for the doubly linked list to be sorted, and how can this property be leveraged in solving the problem?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: The elements are in ascending order, which enables the use of a two-pointer approach by moving from both ends of the list.\",\n    \"What are the implications of the problem stating to use O(N) time complexity and O(1) space complexity when choosing an algorithm?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: This restricts the use of extra data structures, guiding the choice towards an in-place algorithm like the two-pointer approach.\",\n    \"How should you manage the two pointers (one at the head and one at the tail) based on whether their current sum is less than, greater than, or equal to the target?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: If the sum is equal to the target, add the pair to the result and move both pointers.
