Subsequent jumps are equal to the current distance from the start. The goal is to determine if the frog can reach a distance N.\\n- Identifying Potential Patterns: The frog's jumps follow a pattern. The first jump is 1, then if the frog is at x, it jumps x units. We need to determine if N can be reached through this jumping pattern.\\n- Formulating a Hypothesis: Based on the examples, it seems that N must be a power of 2 to be reachable. For example, 2 (2^1) is reachable (0 -> 1 -> 2), but 3 is not. This is because after the first jump, the frog is at position 1. Every subsequent jump is equal to the frog's position. Therefore, to reach N, the number N must be represented as 2^k where k is a non-negative integer.\\n- Validating the Hypothesis:  If N is a power of 2, the frog can reach it. After the initial jump to 1, if N is 2, the frog jumps 1 and reaches 2. If N is 4, after the initial jump to 1, the frog jumps 1 to reach 2, and then jumps 2 to reach 4, and so on.\\n- Edge Case Handling: If N is 1, the frog can reach it with the first jump. Odd numbers greater than 1 are not reachable, because after the first jump to 1, all later jumps will be of the same size as the current position and will only lead to even numbers plus 1, or if you're already at an even position, to another even position. If N is even, then N should be a power of 2.\\n- Developing the Algorithm: Check if N is 1. If it is, return true. If N is odd and greater than 1, return false. If N is even, repeatedly divide N by 2. If at any point, N becomes odd, then N cannot be written as 2^k so return false. If N eventually reaches 2, return true.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does the frog's jump distance change with each move, and how is this related to its current position?\",\n    \"What happens after the first jump, and how does it affect the reachable positions in subsequent steps?\",\n    \"Can you identify any specific number sequences that the frog can reach based on its jumping pattern?\",\n    \"What are the key characteristics of numbers that the frog can reach, and how can you use these characteristics to determine if the frog can reach N?\",\n    \"What edge cases exist, and how should they be handled separately from the main logic?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The frog's jump distance is equal to its current distance from the starting point (0). Therefore, if the frog is at position x, the next jump will be x units.\",\n    \"After the first jump, the frog is at position 1. From this point, the frog's jumps will always be equal to its current position, because each jump is determined by the current location.\",\n    \"The frog can reach positions that are powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, ...). After the first jump to 1, any subsequent jump will equal the frog's current position.\",\n    \"The frog can only reach numbers that are powers of 2. After the first jump to 1, each subsequent jump of x from position x will result in the frog reaching x+x = 2x. The initial value (1) multiplied by a power of 2 will always generate a power of 2.\",\n    \"The edge cases are when N is 1 (the frog can reach it directly) or when N is an odd number greater than 1 (the frog can never reach it after the first jump to 1, as each subsequent jump will result in an even position or an odd position plus one).\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
