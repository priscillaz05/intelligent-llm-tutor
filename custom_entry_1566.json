He can perform the following operation on it:\\nPick an index 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N and increase A_{i} by 1.\\n\\nHe would like to obtain an array whose mean and median are equal. Determine the minimum number of operations required to achieve this.\\n\\nNote: The median of an array A of length N is defined as follows:\\nSort the array A. Then, \\nIf N is even, the median is the (\\\\frac{N}{2})^{\\\\text{th}} element\\nIf N is odd, the median is the (\\\\frac{N + 1}{2})^{\\\\text{th}} element\\n\\nFor example, the median of the array [3,4,1,2] is 2 and the median of the array [3,4,1] is 3.\\n\\n------ Input Format ------ \\n\\n- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of testcases.

They are already equal, so no operations are required.\\n\\nTest Case $2$: It is optimal to apply the operation on $1^{st}$ and $2^{nd}$ index twice each. The array after applying these operations will be $[3, 3, 3, 3]$, which has both mean and median $3$.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def check(arr, mean, n):\\n\\tsum = 0\\n\\tfor i in range(len(arr)):\\n\\t\\tsum += arr[i]\\n\\tallowed_operations = n * mean - sum\\n\\tif allowed_operations < 0:\\n\\t\\treturn -1\\n\\trequired_operations = 0\\n\\tfor i in range((n - 1) // 2, n):\\n\\t\\trequired_operations += max(0, mean - arr[i])\\n\\tif required_operations > allowed_operations:\\n\\t\\treturn -1\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\treturn allowed_operations\\nfor i in range(int(input())):\\n\\tN = int(input())\\n\\tarr = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\\n\\tarr = sorted(arr)\\n\\tl = arr[(len(arr) - 1) // 2]\\n\\tr = arr[len(arr) - 1]\\n\\tans = -1\\n\\tn = len(arr)\\n\\twhile l <= r:\\n\\t\\tmid = (l + r) // 2\\n\\t\\tminOp = check(arr, mid, n)\\n\\t\\tif minOp != -1:\\n\\t\\t\\tans = minOp\\n\\t\\t\\tr = mid - 1\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tl = mid + 1\\n\\tprint(ans)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem asks to find the minimum number of operations (incrementing an element by 1) required to make the mean and median of an array equal.\\n- Identifying Key Concepts: Mean is the sum of elements divided by the number of elements. Median is the middle element of the sorted array (or the average of the two middle elements if the array has even length). Since we only increment elements, we can only increase the mean and median.\\n- Selecting Algorithmic Strategy: The strategy is to use binary search to find the target value where the mean and median are equal. The binary search will operate on a possible range of values that the median can take. A helper function is used to check if it's possible to achieve a particular median value and what the number of operations required are.\\n- Implementing the Helper Function: The helper function must calculate two values: allowed operations based on the desired mean, and required operations to make the array's median become the desired value. If the required operations exceed the allowed operations, the desired mean/median value cannot be achieved.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for the mean and median of an array to be equal, and why is this the goal?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: The mean (average) and median (middle element of sorted array) should have the same value.
