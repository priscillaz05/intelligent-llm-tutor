The tutorial tells many strange and unexpected for Johnny things, such as you have to be patient or that very important is solving many harder and harder problems. \\n\\nThe boy has found an online judge with tasks divided by topics they cover. He has picked $p^{k_i}$ problems from $i$-th category ($p$ is his favorite number). He wants to solve them in two weeks (the patience condition is too hard for Johnny, so for simplicity, he looks only at easy tasks, which can be solved in such a period). Now our future grandmaster has to decide which topics to cover first and which the second week. Help him assign topics in such a way, that workload is balanced.\\n\\nFormally, given $n$ numbers $p^{k_i}$, the boy wants to divide them into two disjoint sets, minimizing the absolute difference between sums of numbers in each set. Find the minimal absolute difference. Output the result modulo $10^{9}+7$.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nInput consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains one integer $t$ $(1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 10^5)$\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. Each test case is described as follows:\\n\\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $p$ $(1 \\\\leq n, p \\\\leq 10^6)$. The second line contains $n$ integers $k_i$ $(0 \\\\leq k_i \\\\leq 10^6)$.\\n\\nThe sum of $n$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $10^6$.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nOutput one integer\u00a0\u2014 the reminder of division the answer by $1\\\\,000\\\\,000\\\\,007$.\\n\\n\\n-----Example-----\\nInput\\n4\\n5 2\\n2 3 4 4 3\\n3 1\\n2 10 1000\\n4 5\\n0 1 1 100\\n1 8\\n89\\n\\nOutput\\n4\\n1\\n146981438\\n747093407\\n\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nYou have to minimize the difference, not it's remainder. For example, if the minimum difference is equal to $2$, but there is also a distribution where the difference is $10^9 + 8$, then the answer is $2$, not $1$.\\n\\nIn the first test case of the example, there're the following numbers: $4$, $8$, $16$, $16$, and $8$. We can divide them into such two sets: ${4, 8, 16}$ and ${8, 16}$. Then the difference between the sums of numbers in sets would be $4$.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import sys\\nreadline = sys.stdin.readline\\nT = int(readline())\\nAns = [None] * T\\nMOD = 10 ** 9 + 7\\nmod = 10 ** 9 + 9\\nfor qu in range(T):\\n\\t(N, P) = map(int, readline().split())\\n\\tA = list(map(int, readline().split()))\\n\\tif P == 1:\\n\\t\\tif N & 1:\\n\\t\\t\\tAns[qu] = 1\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tAns[qu] = 0\\n\\t\\tcontinue\\n\\tif N == 1:\\n\\t\\tAns[qu] = pow(P, A[0], MOD)\\n\\t\\tcontinue\\n\\tA.sort(reverse=True)\\n\\tcans = 0\\n\\tcarry = 0\\n\\tres = 0\\n\\tra = 0\\n\\tfor a in A:\\n\\t\\tif carry == 0:\\n\\t\\t\\tcarry = pow(P, a, mod)\\n\\t\\t\\tcans = pow(P, a, MOD)\\n\\t\\t\\tcontinue\\n\\t\\tres = (res + pow(P, a, mod)) % mod\\n\\t\\tra = (ra + pow(P, a, MOD)) % MOD\\n\\t\\tif res == carry and ra == cans:\\n\\t\\t\\tcarry = 0\\n\\t\\t\\tcans = 0\\n\\t\\t\\tra = 0\\n\\t\\t\\tres = 0\\n\\tAns[qu] = (cans - ra) % MOD\\nprint('\\\\n'.join(map(str, Ans)))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the problem: The problem is to divide a set of numbers, where each number is p raised to the power of ki, into two disjoint sets such that the absolute difference between the sums of the two sets is minimized. The result needs to be output modulo 10^9 + 7.\\n- Identifying edge cases and constraints: We need to handle multiple test cases. The values of n, p, and ki are up to 10^6. We need to consider the case where p=1 and the case where n=1.\\n- Choosing a strategy: A key observation is that sorting the powers in descending order allows us to greedily attempt to balance the sums. Start by placing the largest power in one set. Then, iterate through the remaining powers, adding them to the set with the smaller sum until the sums become equal, after which both sets are equal and the answer is zero. Otherwise calculate the difference between the two sums.\\n- Implementation details: Use modular arithmetic to prevent overflow and handle negative results correctly.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the core objective of this problem, and what are the key constraints that must be considered during implementation?\",\n    \"How does sorting the input powers affect the strategy for minimizing the difference between the two sets?\",\n    \"How can you use modular arithmetic to avoid overflow and ensure the correctness of the output?\",\n    \"What are some crucial edge cases to handle, and how would they impact the solution's logic?\",\n    \"What is the rationale behind the use of modulo 10^9 + 7, and how does it relate to the problem's output requirement?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The objective is to divide the powers of p into two sets such that the absolute difference of their sums is minimized, returning the result modulo 10^9 + 7. Constraints include handling multiple test cases and ensuring values stay within specified limits to avoid overflows.\",\n    \"Sorting the powers in descending order facilitates a greedy approach: starting with the largest power, the remaining powers are added to the set with the smaller sum, allowing for optimal balancing between the sets.\",\n    \"Modular arithmetic ensures that all intermediate and final values remain within manageable bounds. Specifically, apply the modulo operation after each addition or multiplication to prevent overflow and wrap the result within the specified range.\",\n    \"Edge cases to consider include scenarios where p=1, or n=1. When p=1, the problem reduces to whether n is odd or even. If n is odd the answer is 1, otherwise the answer is 0. When n=1, the answer is simply p to the power of the first element in the array, taken modulo 10^9 + 7.\",\n    \"The use of modulo 10^9 + 7 is to ensure that the output remains within the range of a 32-bit integer and also helps to prevent overflow. It's used as the final step to bring the answer within the constraints.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
