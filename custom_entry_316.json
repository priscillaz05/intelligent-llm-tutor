If the substring appears fewer than n times, the function should return -1.\\n- Choosing an Iterative Strategy: We must iterate to find multiple occurrences. We can use the `string.find()` method repeatedly, updating the starting position for each search. Handle the edge case where the substring is not found enough times by returning -1.\\n- Overlapping Occurrences: To account for overlapping occurrences, the search must begin from the index immediately after the end of the previous occurrence. Therefore, the start index for `string.find()` in each iteration will need to be updated.\\n- Initializing and Updating Index: Initialize `idx` to -1, so that the search starts from the beginning of the string. In each iteration, update `idx` with the new index returned by `string.find()`. If `string.find()` returns -1, it means the substring was not found, so return -1.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you handle the case where the substring appears fewer than 'n' times in the main string?\",\n    \"How do you ensure that overlapping occurrences of the substring are correctly identified and their indices returned?\",\n    \"Why is the `idx` variable initialized to -1 and how is it updated during each iteration?\",\n    \"Can you explain the role of the `string.find()` method and how its arguments are used to solve the problem?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"If `string.find()` returns -1 at any point, it means that there are less than 'n' occurrences of the substring. In this case, you should immediately return -1.\",\n    \"To find overlapping occurrences, the starting index of the search (the second argument to `string.find()`) must be updated to `idx + 1` in each iteration. This ensures that the search continues from the position immediately after the previous occurrence.\",\n    \"`idx` is initialized to -1 because the first call to `string.find()` should start the search from the beginning of the string. In each iteration, `idx` is updated with the index of the newly found substring using `idx = string.find(substring, idx + 1)`. If the substring isn't found, `idx` will be -1 after the call to find.\",\n    \"`string.find(substring, start)` searches for the first occurrence of `substring` within the string, starting from the index `start`. It returns the index of the first occurrence if found, and -1 otherwise. In this solution, the `start` argument is `idx + 1` to account for potential overlapping occurrences.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
