The colleagues were without any weapons, only the mathematician had a knife. And with no weapons they were not able to fight with the military, so they decided to kill themselves rather than being killed by military.\\nThey all decided that they will stand in a circle and the every third person will \\nkill himself but the mathematician didn't like this idea and had no intention \\nof killing himself. He calculates where should he stand so that he is the last one left. You have to tell the serial number of last man standing. \\nNote:- Instead of every 3rd position it will be every 2nd position and of course the number of colleagues will be much more than 40.\\n\\nInput:-\\nThe first line of input is an integer N  that specifies the number of test cases. After that every line contains an integer X  which is the number of colleagues.\\n\\nOutput:-\\nFor each test case generate a line containing the position of the colleague who survives. Assume that the colleagues have serial numbers from 1 to n and that the counting starts with person 1, i.e., the first person leaving is the one with number 2.\\n\\nConstraints:-\\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 1000\\n5 \u2264 X \u2264 100000000\\n\\nSAMPLE INPUT\\n4\\n5\\n11\\n45\\n23987443\\n\\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\\n3\\n7\\n27\\n14420455\\n\\nExplanation\\n\\nTaking the case of the first test case if there are 5 participants in the circle, the first to go is 2, followed by 4, followed by 1, followed by 5 which leaves 3 at the end.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"'''\\n   \\n\\tint main()\\n\\t{\\n\\tint t;\\n\\tcin>>t;\\n\\twhile(t--)\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tlong long a;\\n\\t\\tcin>>a;\\n\\t\\tif(a&(a-1)==0)\\n\\t\\t cout<<\\\"1\\\\n\\\";\\n\\t\\telse\\n\\t\\t {\\n\\t\\t \\tlong long n=a,p=2,m=0;\\n\\t\\t \\twhile(p<n)\\n\\t\\t \\t {\\n\\t\\t \\t \\tm++;\\n\\t\\t \\t \\tp=2*p;\\n\\t\\t\\t  }\\n\\t\\t\\t  p=p/2;\\n\\t\\t\\t  //cout<<\\\" m->\\\"<<m<<\\\" p->\\\"<<p<<endl;\\n\\t\\t\\t  cout<<2*(n-p)+1<<endl;;\\n\\t\\t }\\n\\t}\\n\\t}\\n'''\\nt=eval(input())\\nwhile t>0:\\n\\tt=t-1\\n\\ta=eval(input())\\n\\tif a&(a-1)==0:\\n\\t\\tprint(\\\"1\\\\n\\\")\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tn=a\\n\\t\\tp=2\\n\\t\\tm=0\\n\\t\\twhile p<n:\\n\\t\\t\\tm=m+1\\n\\t\\t\\tp=2*p\\n\\t\\tp=p/2\\n\\t\\tprint(2*(n-p)+1)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem describes a survival game where every second person is eliminated in a circle. The goal is to find the position of the last person standing, given the total number of people.\\n- Identifying the Pattern: The last person standing is determined by finding the largest power of 2 less than or equal to the total number of people, and then applying a formula based on that power of 2 and the total number of people. This pattern arises because when the number of people is a power of 2, the first person (position 1) always survives.\\n- Algorithm Choice: The most efficient way is to find the largest power of 2 that is <= the number of people given. We can repeatedly double a power of 2 from 1 until it exceeds the input, and then halve it back. The formula is 2*(n-p)+1.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: If the number of colleagues itself is a power of 2 (a&(a-1) == 0), then the survivor is always at position 1.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Can you explain the game's rules and how the elimination process works?\",\n    \"What is the significance of finding the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the number of people?\",\n    \"What is the edge case where the answer will automatically be 1, and when does this occur?\",\n    \"Could you describe the overall approach to determine the survivor's position, and which mathematical operations can be used for that?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"In the game, people stand in a circle, and every second person is eliminated. This process continues until only one person remains, who is declared the survivor.\",\n    \"The largest power of 2 less than or equal to the number of people is a key value because when the number of people is a power of 2, the person who starts at position 1 always survives. This power of 2 is used to calculate the offset in the final formula.\",\n    \"The edge case where the result is 1 is when the number of people is a power of 2, i.e., can be expressed as 2 raised to an integer power. This can be verified by the condition a&(a-1) == 0.\",\n    \"The approach involves finding the largest power of 2 (p) less than or equal to the number of people (n) and applying the formula 2*(n-p)+1 to calculate the survivor's position. This includes doubling and potentially halving the value of 'p' in iterations to reach the correct power of 2, along with arithmetic operations to produce the final result.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
