Key constraints include inverting colors of the squares in between the chosen squares, and using each square exactly once. The edge cases need to be checked at the beginning to see if the first or the last squares are already white. If they are, the answer is 0, as it is impossible to make them white through the given operation.\\n- Constructing an Auxiliary Array for Simplification: An array is constructed to represent whether each square is on the 'left' or 'right' side of an inversion pair. This helps simplify the counting of valid inversions.\\n- Validating the Configuration: The core condition for a valid solution is that the number of 'L' (left) and 'R' (right) assignments must be equal. If they aren't, then there are no solutions. \\n- Counting Inversion Pairs and Calculating Initial Ways: A variable keeps track of the number of available 'left' squares. The number of valid ways to pair an 'L' square with an 'R' square is computed iteratively. This yields a certain number of combinations.\\n- Accounting for Ordering of the Inversion Steps: After calculating the ways to make valid pairs, need to also consider the number of ways to arrange the N inversion operations. This is N!.\\n- Combining the Results: The final answer is the product of the initial ways with N! modulo 10^9+7.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the initial edge cases you should check for before diving into the more complex logic?\",\n    \"How can you represent whether each square is on the 'left' or 'right' side of an inversion to help solve the problem?\",\n    \"What condition must be met regarding the number of 'L' and 'R' assignments for a valid solution to exist?\",\n    \"How do you determine the number of valid ways to pair 'L' squares with 'R' squares?\",\n    \"Besides the pairing of squares, what other factor related to the operations needs to be considered in the calculation?\",\n    \"How do you combine the ways of making valid pairs with the arrangement of operations to obtain the final answer?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Before anything else, check if the first or last squares are white. If either is white, then there are no possible solutions, and you should return 0.\",\n    \"You can create an auxiliary array where each element represents either 'L' or 'R', indicating whether that square is on the left or right side of an inversion. This array is constructed based on the color of each square and its neighbor.\",\n    \"For a valid solution to exist, the number of 'L' assignments must equal the number of 'R' assignments. If they are not equal, the answer is 0.\",\n    \"To determine the number of valid ways, you can iterate through the 'L' and 'R' assignments, keeping track of the available 'L' squares and multiplying by them each time you encounter an 'R' square. Make sure to apply the modulo operation.\",\n    \"You also need to consider the arrangement of the N inversion operations. Since there are N operations, there are N! ways to arrange them.\",\n    \"Multiply the initial number of ways by N! to account for the arrangement of operations.
