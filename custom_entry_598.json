Acknowledge that lower density liquids should float to the top.\\n- Defining Density: Recognize the need for a mapping or dictionary to store the densities of different liquids (Honey, Water, Alcohol, Oil).\\n- Flattening the Array: Consider how to efficiently combine the 2D array into a 1D array for easy sorting.\\n- Sorting by Density: Use the density mapping to sort the liquids in the flattened array.\\n- Reconstructing the 2D Array: Divide the sorted 1D array back into a 2D array with the original width (number of columns).\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you handle the density differences between liquids, and what data structure would be appropriate for storing these densities?\",\n    \"How would you convert the 2D array into a 1D array to facilitate sorting?\",\n    \"What sorting algorithm would you use to sort the liquids based on their density, and how can you integrate the density mapping into the sorting process?\",\n    \"After sorting, how would you reconstruct the 2D array while maintaining the original width?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"I would use a dictionary to map each liquid to its density. This allows for easy lookup during the sorting process.\",\n    \"I would use a nested loop to iterate through each row and column of the 2D array, appending each element to a new 1D array.\",\n    \"I would use the `sorted` function with a custom key that uses the density dictionary to compare the liquids. This key function retrieves the density of each liquid, allowing the `sorted` function to arrange them accordingly.\",\n    \"I would iterate through the sorted 1D array, creating new rows by taking chunks of elements equal to the width of the original 2D array. These rows are then added to a new 2D array.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
