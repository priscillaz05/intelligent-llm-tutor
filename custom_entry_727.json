Each problem set must contain at least two problems, and all problems within a set must have unique difficulty levels. Each problem can only belong to one problem set.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints:  The key constraint is that each problem set needs at least two problems with unique difficulty levels. This means we need to count how many unique difficulty levels exist among the four problems.\\n- Developing an Algorithm: The number of unique difficulty levels determines the maximum number of problem sets. If there are 4 or 3 unique levels, we can always form 2 problem sets. If there are only 2 unique levels, we can form 2 problem sets only if each difficulty level appears twice in the input; otherwise, we can only form 1 problem set. If there is only 1 unique difficulty level, we cannot form any problem set because we need at least two distinct difficulty levels within a set.\\n- Edge Cases: Cases where all problem difficulties are the same. Cases where there are multiple repeating difficulties.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the conditions necessary to form a valid problem set?\",\n    \"How does the number of distinct difficulty levels affect the maximum number of problem sets?\",\n    \"If there are only two distinct difficulty levels, what additional check is required to determine the maximum number of problem sets?\",\n    \"What is the base case or the simplest scenario where no problem sets can be formed?\",\n    \"How do you handle the input and process it to determine the difficulty levels?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A valid problem set must contain at least two problems, and no two problems in the set can have the same difficulty level.\",\n    \"If there are four or three unique difficulty levels, then two problem sets can be created. If there is only one unique difficulty level, no problem set can be created.\",\n    \"If there are only two distinct difficulty levels, we need to check if each difficulty level appears exactly twice. If so, we can create two problem sets. If not, we can only create one problem set.\",\n    \"The simplest scenario where no problem sets can be formed is when all four problems have the same difficulty level.\",\n    \"The input consists of four space-separated integers, which represent the difficulty levels of the problems.
