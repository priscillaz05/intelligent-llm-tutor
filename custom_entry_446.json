The T-shirt size is either a string M or a string consisting of several (possibly zero) characters X and one of the characters S or L.\\n\\nFor example, strings M, XXL, S, XXXXXXXS could be the size of some T-shirts. And the strings XM, LL, SX are not sizes.\\n\\nThe letter M stands for medium, S for small, L for large. The letter X refers to the degree of size (from eXtra). For example, XXL is extra-extra-large (bigger than XL, and smaller than XXXL).\\n\\nYou need to compare two given sizes of T-shirts $a$ and $b$.\\n\\nThe T-shirts are compared as follows:\\n\\nany small size (no matter how many letters X) is smaller than the medium size and any large size;\\n\\nany large size (regardless of the number of letters X) is larger than the medium size and any small size;\\n\\nthe more letters X before S, the smaller the size;\\n\\nthe more letters X in front of L, the larger the size.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nXXXS < XS\\n\\nXXXL > XL\\n\\nXL > M\\n\\nXXL = XXL\\n\\nXXXXXS < M\\n\\nXL > XXXS\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases.\\n\\nEach test case consists of one line, in which $a$ and $b$ T-shirt sizes are written. The lengths of the strings corresponding to the T-shirt sizes do not exceed $50$.

Sizes ending in 'S' are smaller than 'M' and 'L', while sizes ending in 'L' are larger than 'M' and 'S'. The number of 'X's dictates the degree of smallness (for 'S') or largeness (for 'L').\\n- Formulating a Scoring System: Consider assigning scores to each size based on its type and the number of 'X's.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Consider edge cases like comparing 'M' with other sizes, and sizes with varying numbers of 'X's.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you quantify the comparison between a size ending in 'S' and a size ending in 'L'?\",\n    \"What scoring logic can you implement to compare sizes with different numbers of 'X's?\",\n    \"How should the comparison handle the 'M' size, given its position between 'S' and 'L'?\",\n    \"How can you extract the relevant information (number of 'X's and the final letter) from the T-shirt size string?\",\n    \"Which data structure can be used to compare the string sizes and return the appropriate comparision operator?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Any size ending in 'S' is always smaller than any size ending in 'L', regardless of the number of 'X's.\",\n    \"For sizes ending in 'S', a higher number of 'X's indicates a smaller size (more negative score). For sizes ending in 'L', a higher number of 'X's means a larger size (more positive score).  M can be assigned a value of 0, S will be a negative value determined by the # of 'X's, and L will be a positive number determined by the # of 'X's\",\n    \"The 'M' size falls between 'S' and 'L'. So, 'M' is greater than any 'S' size and smaller than any 'L' size.\",\n    \"The information can be extracted by analyzing the string from right to left to find the final character ('S', 'M', or 'L') and then counting the number of 'X' characters preceding it.\",\n    \"Integers can be used to score the size of the T-shirt and comparison operators can be used to determine the result.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
