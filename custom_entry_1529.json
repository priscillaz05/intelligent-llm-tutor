We need to compute A_0, A_1, ..., A_M, where A_L is the count of such binomial coefficients for a given L, and M is the maximum L for which A_L > 0.\\n- Breaking Down the Binomial Coefficient:  C(N, K) = N! / (K! * (N-K)!).  The divisibility by P^L depends on the number of factors of P in N!, K!, and (N-K)!. We need to find a way to efficiently calculate the number of factors of P in a factorial.\\n- Legendre's Formula: Legendre's formula gives the exponent of a prime p in n! as sum(floor(n / p^i)) for i = 1 to infinity.  This allows to calculate the number of factors of P in N!, K! and (N-K)!. The exponent of P in C(N,K) is exponent(N!) - exponent(K!) - exponent((N-K)!).\\n- Lucas's Theorem: Lucas's theorem can be used to analyze binomial coefficients modulo a prime number. It states that if n = n_k p^k + ... + n_1 p + n_0 and m = m_k p^k + ... + m_1 p + m_0 are the base p expansions of n and m respectively, then C(n, m) congruent to C(n_k, m_k) * ... * C(n_0, m_0) mod p.\\n- Dynamic Programming or Iterative Counting: We could potentially build up the values of A_L iteratively or use dynamic programming. This is difficult given constraints.\\n- Optimized Counting:  The given solution decomposes N in base P. The counters pprev and nprev keep track of the counts for larger and smaller powers of P. This leverages Lucas' theorem more cleverly than a direct implementation, enabling it to work for large N.  \\n- Implementation Details: We have to loop through all k from 0 to N, which is not possible since N can be as large as 10^{18}.  Therefore we need an optimized solution like the one in the Ground Truth.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you determine if a number is divisible by P^L but not P^(L+1)?\",\n    \"How can Legendre's formula be used to find the number of factors of P in N!?\",\n    \"How can Lucas's Theorem be used to calculate binomial coefficients modulo a prime, and why is this helpful?\",\n    \"Given the constraint that N can be as large as 10^18, how would you avoid iterating through all possible values of K from 0 to N?\",\n    \"Explain the base P decomposition and the logic behind using 'pprev' and 'nprev' counters to efficiently compute the values.\",\n    \"What are the edge cases or special conditions to consider in this problem, and how would you handle them?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"To determine if a number is divisible by P^L but not P^(L+1), you can find the highest power of P that divides the number.
