The number of cakes for each selected number is determined by the number of set bits (1s) in its binary representation.\\n- Identifying Key Steps: The core steps are calculating the number of set bits for each number, selecting the K numbers with the highest number of set bits, and summing the set bits of the selected numbers to find the maximum number of cakes.\\n- Developing an Algorithm: An efficient algorithm will calculate the number of set bits for each input number. Then the numbers should be sorted based on their set bit counts. Finally, it selects the top K numbers and sum their bit counts.\\n- Edge Cases and Constraints: Consider the constraints such as N (number of input numbers), K (number of numbers to select), and the range of input numbers (0 to 10^5). Also, consider an edge case where K is 0.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you efficiently calculate the number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of a number?\",\n    \"What data structure can you use to store the numbers along with their corresponding set bit counts, facilitating easy sorting?\",\n    \"How does the constraint on the input numbers (0 to 10^5) affect your approach to calculating set bits?\",\n    \"What should you do if K is 0?\",\n    \"How can you handle the input and output efficiently, considering the number of test cases?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Efficiently calculate the number of set bits in a number by using bit manipulation techniques like n & (n - 1), which clears the least significant bit. Counting how many times this operation can be done until n becomes 0 will determine the total number of set bits.\",\n    \"A list of tuples or a dictionary, where keys are the original numbers and values are their corresponding set bit counts, can be used. The dictionary can be sorted based on the values (set bit counts). Alternatively, one can maintain a list of the set bit counts and then use this for sorting indices of the original number list\",\n    \"The constraint on input numbers (0 to 10^5) implies that we can use a direct iterative approach without worrying about overflow or extremely large numbers. We don't need to precompute results for a large range since the constraint limits the upper bound.\",\n    \"If K is 0, it means Monk doesn't select any number. Therefore, the maximum number of cakes he can have is 0.\",\n    \"Use the input() function in python to take inputs efficiently.
