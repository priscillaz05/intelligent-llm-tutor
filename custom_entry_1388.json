The goal is to determine the outcome assuming optimal play.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints: The Cat cannot enter node 0 (Hole). The graph size is limited (3-50 nodes). Mouse starts at node 1, Cat at node 2, Hole at node 0.\\n- Selecting Algorithmic Approach: A suitable approach is using Dynamic Programming or a modified Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore possible game states. A state can be represented by (mouse_position, cat_position, turn). The values can be cached to avoid repeated computations. The game can be seen as a minimax problem where the players want to maximize their chances of winning. Determine win/loss/draw from a given state by exploring further turns via BFS and keeping track of visited positions.\\n- Identifying Edge Cases: Handle cases where the graph is small or has specific structures (e.g., disconnected components). Consider optimal play implications \u2013 a draw means neither player can force a win.\\n- Encoding Game State: The state should encode the mouse's position, the cat's position, and whose turn it is. This is crucial for detecting repeated positions and applying the rules correctly.\\n- Optimizations: Implement memoization (caching) to avoid redundant computations. Reduce the state space by considering only reachable states.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you represent the game's state effectively to avoid redundant computations?\",\n    \"What conditions determine a win, loss, or draw for each player, and how do you encode these in the algorithm?\",\n    \"How can you optimize the search to explore only reachable states and reduce computational complexity?\",\n    \"How do you implement the optimal play strategy for both players in the search algorithm?\",\n    \"How do you handle edge cases, such as small graphs, disconnected components, or specific initial positions?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The game's state can be represented as a tuple (mouse_position, cat_position, turn), where turn indicates whose move it is (Mouse or Cat). Memoization, or caching, can be employed to store the result (win, loss, draw) for each state, avoiding recomputation.\",\n    \"A Mouse wins if it reaches node 0. A Cat wins if it occupies the same node as the Mouse. A Draw occurs if a position (mouse_position, cat_position, turn) is repeated during the game. These conditions need to be encoded in the search algorithm to determine the outcome of each state.\",\n    \"Optimize the search by only exploring reachable states from the current game state. Consider the graph's structure and connectivity to prune the search space. Memoization helps avoid revisiting explored states.\",\n    \"Implement a Minimax approach where each player chooses the move that maximizes their chance of winning, assuming the opponent plays optimally. Use recursion or iteration to explore all possible moves and select the optimal one based on the opponent's possible responses.\",\n    \"Handle small graphs with specific checks. For disconnected components, determine if the Mouse can reach the Hole before the Cat can reach the Mouse. For initial positions, ensure that the starting conditions are correctly handled, such as the Cat not starting at the Hole (node 0).\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
