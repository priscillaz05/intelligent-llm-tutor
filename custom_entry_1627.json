The elephant with number K (1 \u2264 K \u2264 N) will be happy if he receives at least A_{K} candies. There are C candies in all in the Zoo.\\n\\nThe Zoo staff is interested in knowing whether it is possible to make all the N elephants happy by giving each elephant at least as many candies as he wants, that is, the K^{th} elephant should receive at least A_{K} candies. Each candy can be given to only one elephant. Print Yes if it is possible and No otherwise.\\n\\n------ Input ------ \\n\\nThe first line of the input file contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of exactly 2 lines. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and C, the total number of elephants and the total number of candies in the Zoo respectively. The second line contains N space separated integers A_{1}, A_{2}, ..., A_{N}.\\n\\n------ Output ------ \\n\\nFor each test case output exactly one line containing the string Yes if it possible to make all elephants happy and the string No otherwise. Output is case sensitive. So do not print YES or yes.\\n\\n------ Constraints ------ \\n\\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 1000\\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 100\\n1 \u2264 C \u2264 10^{9}\\n1 \u2264 A_{K} \u2264 10000, for K = 1, 2, ..., N\\n\\n----- Sample Input 1 ------ \\n2\\n2 3\\n1 1\\n3 7\\n4 2 2\\n----- Sample Output 1 ------ \\nYes\\nNo\\n----- explanation 1 ------ \\nCase 1. We can give one candy to the first elephant and two candies to the second elephant and make them both happy. Hence the answer is Yes. Alternatively we can give one candy to each elephant and left one candy for ourselves but they again will be happy.\\n\\nCase 2. Even if we give four candies to the first elephant and two candies to the second elephant we will have only one candy left and can not make last elephant happy since he needs two candies for his happiness. Hence the answer is No.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"for i in range(int(input())):\\n\\tx = list(map(int, input().split()))\\n\\tv = list(map(int, input().split()))\\n\\tc = x[1]\\n\\tfor i in v:\\n\\t\\tc = c - i\\n\\tif c >= 0:\\n\\t\\tprint('Yes')\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tprint('No')\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem states that there are N elephants, each needing a certain amount of candies A_K to be happy. We have C candies in total. The goal is to determine if it's possible to distribute candies such that every elephant is happy, i.e., receives at least the required number of candies.\\n- Formulating an Algorithm: To solve this, calculate the total number of candies required by all elephants. Compare this total with the number of candies available, C. If the total required candies is less than or equal to C, then it's possible to make all elephants happy. Otherwise, it is not possible.\\n- Handling Multiple Test Cases: The input contains T test cases. Therefore, the above steps must be repeated for each test case.\\n- Optimizing for Constraints: Given constraints of N <= 100 and A_K <= 10000, the sum of required candies will be at most 100 * 10000 = 10^6, which fits within the integer range and poses no overflow issues. C can be as large as 10^9, so integer arithmetic is appropriate.\\n- Input Parsing: Parse the input correctly, extracting N, C, and the list of required candies A_K for each test case.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you calculate the total number of candies needed by all the elephants?\",\n    \"How do you determine whether it is possible to make all elephants happy given the total number of candies needed and the number of candies available?\",\n    \"What should you do if the input contains multiple test cases?\",\n    \"Given the constraints, is there a possibility of integer overflow when calculating the total candies needed, and how would you mitigate this if necessary?\",\n    \"How would you efficiently read and parse the input data in the specified format?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Sum the values of A_K for all elephants from K = 1 to N. This sum represents the total number of candies required.\",\n    \"If the sum of candies required is less than or equal to C (the total candies available), it's possible to make all elephants happy; otherwise, it's not possible.\",\n    \"Loop through each test case, read the input data for each case, perform the calculation, and print the corresponding output (Yes or No).\",\n    \"Given the constraints 1 \u2264 N \u2264 100 and 1 \u2264 A_{K} \u2264 10000, the maximum possible sum is 100 * 10000 = 1,000,000, which is well within the range of standard integer types. So, integer overflow is not a concern.\",\n    \"First, read the integer T (number of test cases). Then, for each test case, read N and C from the first line and the list A_1, A_2, ..., A_N from the second line using appropriate input parsing techniques (e.g., using `map(int, input().split())` in Python).\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
