This means no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\\n- Identifying Constraints: Each row can only have one queen. Each column can only have one queen. Diagonals must be checked to ensure no two queens attack each other diagonally. Need to find all distinct valid configurations.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: Backtracking is an efficient approach for solving this problem. Iterate through each row, trying to place a queen in each column. If a placement is valid, recursively call the function for the next row. If a placement is invalid, backtrack and try the next column.\\n- Implementation Details: Use helper function for backtracking. Maintain auxiliary data structures to track rows, columns, and diagonals that are occupied by a queen. Convert the final board configuration to the required string format.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the constraints that define a valid placement of queens on the board?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\",\n    \"How can backtracking be applied to solve the N-Queens problem?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: Try placing a queen in each column of a row, and recursively call the function for the next row if the placement is valid. If the placement is invalid, backtrack and try the next column.\",\n    \"What data structures can be used to keep track of occupied rows, columns, and diagonals?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: Sets or lists can be used to track occupied rows and columns. The diagonals can be identified using row + col and row - col.\",\n    \"When should the algorithm backtrack and how is it implemented?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: The algorithm should backtrack when a queen placement leads to an invalid configuration. Backtracking is implemented by undoing the queen placement and trying the next column.\",\n    \"How would you represent the board configuration in the required string format once a valid solution is found?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: Use a list of strings where each string represents a row. 'Q' represents a queen, and '.' represents an empty space.\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\",\n    \"Try placing a queen in each column of a row, and recursively call the function for the next row if the placement is valid.
