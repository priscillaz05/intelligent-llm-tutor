If it's impossible, return -1.\\n- Identifying Edge Cases and Simplifications: If there are already 1s in the array, the number of operations is simply n - (number of 1s). If the gcd of all elements is not 1, it's impossible to make all elements 1.\\n- Choosing an Algorithmic Strategy: Iterate through all possible subarrays to find the shortest subarray whose GCD is 1.  Once a subarray with GCD equal to 1 is found, it takes (length of array - 1) + (length of shortest subarray with gcd equal to 1) operations to transform all the other elements to 1.\\n- Implementation Details: Use `math.gcd` to compute the greatest common divisor.
