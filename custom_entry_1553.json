Recognize that there is a limitation to using only arithmetic operations. Note that the print statement should construct the required pattern of repeating digits based on the loop index.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Consider the edge cases in terms of different values of the loop counter `i` and how they translate to the number to be printed. Acknowledge that using string manipulation is prohibited and would result in a score of 0. Recognize the constraint $1 \\\\leq N \\\\leq 9$ which limits the loop counter `i` to a maximum value of 8 and, in turn, the number of digits in the largest number to be printed to a maximum of 8.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Because of the prompt and the forbidden nature of strings, construct the correct output based on chained if-else to achieve printing a number with identical digits based on the iteration number.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Construct a series of conditional statements to correctly print the required numbers based on the value of the loop counter `i`.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What kind of operations am I allowed to use and what am I explicitly not allowed to use?\",\n    \"What are the ranges of the inputs and how can that help simplify my solution?\",\n    \"How do I create different repeating digits without string concatenation?\",\n    \"How would a chain of if/else statements help achieve the problem's goal?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"I'm only allowed to use arithmetic operations and `print`. I am not allowed to use string operations.\",\n    \"The input is a positive integer between 1 and 9. The loop will run from 1 up to N-1. The largest number to print will have a repeating digit of 8.\",\n    \"I would generate numbers using only multiplication and addition and also without string manipulations. So using chained conditional checks is helpful.\",\n    \"A chain of if/else statements can map the iteration variable to specific numbers that need to be printed. Each statement checks for a given value of `i` and constructs the corresponding repeated digit number using the if statement's conditional value. Because of the prompt and the forbidden nature of strings, this is an accepted approach.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
