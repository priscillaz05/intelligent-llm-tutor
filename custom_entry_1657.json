Events have start and end days, and we can attend an event on any day within its range.\\n- Data Structures Choice: A min-heap can be used to keep track of available events sorted by their end day. We can also sort the events by start day.\\n- Algorithm Selection: Iterate through days. For each day, add events that start on or before that day to the min-heap. Then, greedily attend the event that ends earliest. Clean up the heap by removing any events that have already passed.\\n- Time Complexity Optimization: Sorting the events by start day will allow us to add potentially attendable events efficiently. Using a min-heap to keep track of the earliest ending events will allow us to choose which event to attend for the current day efficiently.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Why is it important to sort the events by their start day?\",\n    \"What is the purpose of using a min-heap, and what are we storing in the heap?\",\n    \"How do you manage the current day, and how does it influence event selection?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases or constraints that need to be considered, and how might they affect the solution?\",\n    \"How do you remove expired events from the heap, and why is it important?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Sorting events by their start day ensures that you can efficiently identify and add events that are available to attend on or before a given day.\",\n    \"The min-heap is used to store the end days of the events that are currently available to be attended. This allows us to efficiently pick the event that ends the soonest, applying a greedy approach.\",\n    \"The current day is incremented during each iteration. Events starting on or before the current day are added to the heap and any events with an end day prior to the current day is removed from the heap. We attend the event with the earliest end day from the heap.\",\n    \"Constraints include the number of events, and the range of start and end days. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the input arrays are empty, or when all events overlap.\",\n    \"Expired events (events with end dates before the current day) are removed from the heap to ensure only valid events are considered and to ensure that the heap does not grow unbounded, allowing efficient execution. This avoids attending events in the past.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
