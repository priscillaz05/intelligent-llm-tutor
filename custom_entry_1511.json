Two strings can only be combined if the last character of the first string matches the first character of the second string.\\n- Identify the key conditions: The combining condition is crucial. If no two strings can be combined, return 0.\\n- Categorize strings: Divide the input strings into four categories based on their first and last characters: BB, RR, BR, and RB.\\n- Optimize the combination: Determine how many BR and RB pairs can be combined. The number of such combinations is limited by the minimum of BR and RB counts.\\n- Handle edge cases: Consider cases where there are no BR or RB strings.  Also, when the answer evaluates to the length of the string (meaning a single string), the problem requires to return 0.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you determine if two strings can be combined?\",\n    \"What are the four possible categories for each string based on their first and last characters?\",\n    \"How do you maximize the length of the combined string given the combining condition?\",\n    \"What edge cases need to be considered to ensure the function returns the correct output?\",\n    \"How do you handle the cases where there are only BB/RR strings or when the combined string length equals the length of the single string?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Two strings can be combined if the last character of the first string is equal to the first character of the second string.\",\n    \"The four possible categories are BB, RR, BR, and RB, representing the combinations of the first and last characters of a string.\",\n    \"Maximize the combination by pairing BR and RB strings as much as possible.
