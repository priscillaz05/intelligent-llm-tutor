The i-th vertex has m_i outgoing edges that are labeled as e_i[0], e_i[1], \u2026, e_i[m_i-1], each representing the destination vertex of the edge. The graph can have multiple edges and self-loops. The i-th vertex also has an integer k_i written on itself.\\n\\nA travel on this graph works as follows. \\n\\n  1. Gildong chooses a vertex to start from, and an integer to start with. Set the variable c to this integer. \\n  2. After arriving at the vertex i, or when Gildong begins the travel at some vertex i, add k_i to c. \\n  3. The next vertex is e_i[x] where x is an integer 0 \u2264 x \u2264 m_i-1 satisfying x \u2261 c \\\\pmod {m_i}. Go to the next vertex and go back to step 2. \\n\\n\\nIt's obvious that a travel never ends, since the 2nd and the 3rd step will be repeated endlessly.\\n\\nFor example, assume that Gildong starts at vertex 1 with c = 5, and m_1 = 2, e_1[0] = 1, e_1[1] = 2, k_1 = -3. Right after he starts at vertex 1, c becomes 2. Since the only integer x (0 \u2264 x \u2264 1) where x \u2261 c \\\\pmod {m_i} is 0, Gildong goes to vertex e_1[0] = 1. After arriving at vertex 1 again, c becomes -1. The only integer x satisfying the conditions is 1, so he goes to vertex e_1[1] = 2, and so on.\\n\\nSince Gildong is quite inquisitive, he's going to ask you q queries. He wants to know how many distinct vertices will be visited infinitely many times, if he starts the travel from a certain vertex with a certain value of c. Note that you should not count the vertices that will be visited only finite times.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import io, sys\\ninput = lambda f=io.StringIO(sys.stdin.buffer.read().decode()).readline: f().rstrip()\\nLCM = 2520\\nn = int(input())\\nk = list(map(int, input().split()))\\n(m, e) = ([0] * n, [None] * n)\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\tm[i] = int(input())\\n\\te[i] = list(map(int, input().split()))\\nnxt = []\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\tfor j in range(LCM):\\n\\t\\tx = (j + k[i]) % LCM\\n\\t\\ty = e[i][x % m[i]] - 1\\n\\t\\tnxt.append(y * LCM + x)\\nloop = [None] * (n * LCM)\\nfor i in range(n * LCM):\\n\\tif loop[i]:\\n\\t\\tcontinue\\n\\tloop[i] = set()\\n\\t(cur, rec) = (nxt[i], [i])\\n\\twhile True:\\n\\t\\tif loop[cur] is not None:\\n\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\t\\tloop[cur] = loop[i]\\n\\t\\trec.append(cur)\\n\\t\\tcur = nxt[cur]\\n\\tif loop[cur]:\\n\\t\\tfor u in rec:\\n\\t\\t\\tloop[u] = loop[cur]\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\twhile rec[-1] != cur:\\n\\t\\t\\tloop[i].add(rec.pop() // LCM)\\n\\t\\tloop[i].add(cur // LCM)\\nout = []\\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\\n\\t(x, y) = map(int, input().split())\\n\\tout.append(len(loop[(x - 1) * LCM + y % LCM]))\\nprint(*out, sep='\\\\n')\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem describes a traversal on a directed graph where the next vertex to visit is determined by a formula involving the current vertex, a value 'c', and properties of the graph (k_i, m_i, and e_i).\\n- Identifying the Goal: The objective is to determine, for a given starting vertex and initial value of 'c', the number of distinct vertices that will be visited infinitely often during the traversal.\\n- Choosing a Traversal Strategy: Given that the graph traversal is infinite, we need to identify cycles.  We are looking for vertices within a cycle.\\n- Handling the 'c' value: Understand how the value of 'c' evolves and impacts the traversal. The value 'c' is updated by adding k_i at each vertex and is used modulo m_i to determine the next vertex.\\n- Recognizing the Key Challenge: How to efficiently detect and count the vertices belonging to infinite loops without simulating infinitely long traversals.\\n- Optimization Approach: The solution utilizes the LCM (Least Common Multiple) of all possible values of m_i to track the state of the traversal and detect loops, as the maximum value of m_i is limited to 10. This drastically reduces the search space and makes it practical to determine the cyclical behavior of the graph.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does the value 'c' affect the traversal, and what is its role in determining the next vertex?\",\n    \"Why is it important to identify cycles in the graph traversal, and how does the problem statement define the desired output based on these cycles?\",\n    \"How does limiting the value of m_i help to optimize the solution and what value of LCM is suitable and why?\",\n    \"How to use 'loop' array to avoid repeated calculations and efficiently identify vertices within infinite loops?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The value 'c' is updated at each vertex by adding k_i. The updated value of 'c' modulo m_i determines the index of the next vertex in the outgoing edges array e_i.\",\n    \"Identifying cycles is crucial because the problem asks for the number of distinct vertices that are visited infinitely many times. These vertices are those that lie within a cycle that the traversal enters.\",\n    \"Limiting the value of m_i to a small number allows for using LCM and make the search space manageable. The problem states that 1 <= m_i <= 10, so the LCM of numbers from 1 to 10 is sufficient, which is 2520. Using LCM is important for detecting recurring patterns because after LCM steps, the state should be the same, or in some loop.\",\n    \"The loop array is used to mark vertices that have already been visited during a traversal. When a cycle is detected, all vertices belonging to this cycle are marked, which avoids redundant calculations and ensures efficient identification of vertices within infinite loops. If loop[i] already has some value then that means it is already a part of some cycle.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
