Each student has exactly $k$ votes and is obligated to use all of them. So Awruk knows that if a person gives $a_i$ votes for Elodreip, than he will get exactly $k - a_i$ votes from this person. Of course $0 \\le k - a_i$ holds.\\n\\nAwruk knows that if he loses his life is over. He has been speaking a lot with his friends and now he knows $a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$ \u2014 how many votes for Elodreip each student wants to give. Now he wants to change the number $k$ to win the elections. Of course he knows that bigger $k$ means bigger chance that somebody may notice that he has changed something and then he will be disqualified.\\n\\nSo, Awruk knows $a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$ \u2014 how many votes each student will give to his opponent. Help him select the smallest winning number $k$. In order to win, Awruk needs to get strictly more votes than Elodreip.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains integer $n$ ($1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of students in the school.\\n\\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 100$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of votes each student gives to Elodreip.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nOutput the smallest integer $k$ ($k \\\\ge \\\\max a_i$) which gives Awruk the victory. In order to win, Awruk needs to get strictly more votes than Elodreip.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n5\\n1 1 1 5 1\\n\\nOutput\\n5\\nInput\\n5\\n2 2 3 2 2\\n\\nOutput\\n5\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first example, Elodreip gets $1 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 1 = 9$ votes. The smallest possible $k$ is $5$ (it surely can't be less due to the fourth person), and it leads to $4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 = 16$ votes for Awruk, which is enough to win.\\n\\nIn the second example, Elodreip gets $11$ votes. If $k = 4$, Awruk gets $9$ votes and loses to Elodreip.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"n = int(input())\\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\\nmayor = max(a)\\nel = sum(a)\\nwhile mayor > 0:\\n\\ttotal = 0\\n\\tfor i in range(len(a)):\\n\\t\\taux = a[i]\\n\\t\\taux = mayor - aux\\n\\t\\ttotal = total + aux\\n\\tif total > el:\\n\\t\\tprint(mayor)\\n\\t\\tbreak\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tmayor = mayor + 1\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understand the Problem: The goal is to find the smallest value of $k$ such that Awruk receives strictly more votes than Elodreip. Each of the $n$ students gives $a_i$ votes to Elodreip and $k - a_i$ votes to Awruk.\\n- Determine the Constraints: $k$ must be greater than or equal to the maximum value in the $a$ array. Awruk's total votes must be strictly greater than Elodreip's total votes.\\n- Devise a Strategy: Start with $k$ equal to the maximum value in $a$.  Iteratively increase $k$ and calculate the total votes for Awruk until Awruk's votes are greater than Elodreip's votes.\\n- Implement the Solution: Calculate the sum of $a_i$ (Elodreip's votes). Find the maximum value in $a$ (initial $k$). Iterate, incrementing $k$, and in each iteration compute Awruk's total votes and compare with Elodreip's total. Stop and output $k$ when Awruk wins.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the smallest possible value for k, and how do you find it?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the total number of votes Awruk receives for a given value of k?\",\n    \"How do you determine if Awruk wins the election for a given value of k?\",\n    \"What stopping condition should be used for your loop to ensure the most efficient solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The smallest possible value for k is the maximum value in the array a.

The total number of votes Awruk receives is the sum of k - a[i] for all i from 0 to n-1.\",\n    \"Awruk wins the election if the total number of votes he receives is strictly greater than the total number of votes Elodreip receives.
