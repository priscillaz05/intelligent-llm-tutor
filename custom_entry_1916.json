Since `'He wrd'`are all tied, they occur in the same relative order that they do in the original string, `'Hello world'`.\\n\\nNote that ties don't just happen in the case of characters occuring once in a string. See the second example, `most_common(\\\"Hello He worldwrd\\\")`should return `'lllHeo He wordwrd'`, not `'lllHHeeoo  wwrrdd'`.  **This is a key behavior if this method were to be used to transform a string on multiple passes.**\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"from collections import Counter\\n\\ndef most_common(s):\\n\\tcount = Counter(s)\\n\\treturn ''.join(sorted(s, key=lambda c: -count[c]))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The goal is to reorder a string's characters based on their frequency, preserving the original order for characters with the same frequency. This requires a stable sorting mechanism.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints: The sorted string must have the same length as the input string, and the sorting must be stable.\\n- Choosing Data Structures and Algorithms: A `Counter` object can efficiently count character frequencies. The `sorted` function with a custom key function enables frequency-based sorting while maintaining stability.\\n- Implementing Sorting Logic: Use a lambda function within `sorted` to sort characters by their frequency (in descending order) using the `Counter` object. This ensures that characters with the same frequency retain their original order.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for the transformation to be stable, and how does this constraint affect the choice of sorting algorithms?\",\n    \"How can the `Counter` object be used to efficiently determine the frequency of each character in the string?\",\n    \"What type of sorting algorithm is suitable when preserving original order is essential?\",\n    \"How would you implement the sorting logic using a lambda function, and what should the lambda function return?\",\n    \"How do you ensure that the output string has the same length as the input string?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A stable transformation means that elements that compare equal (in this case, characters with the same frequency) maintain their original order in the input string. This requires using a stable sorting algorithm, which Python's `sorted` function provides by default.\",\n    \"The `Counter` object efficiently counts the occurrences of each character in the string, creating a dictionary-like object where keys are characters and values are their frequencies.\",\n    \"Python's built-in `sorted` function provides a stable sorting algorithm.\",\n    \"You would use a lambda function as the `key` argument to the `sorted` function. The lambda function would return the negative frequency of the character (using `Counter[character]`), which sorts the characters in descending order of frequency while maintaining stability.\",\n    \"Since we are reordering the existing characters in the string and not adding or removing any characters, the output string inherently maintains the same length as the input string. The `join` function concatenates the sorted characters back into a string.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
