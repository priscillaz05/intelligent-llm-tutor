The goal is to assign a unique date to each of the 'n' events within given ranges [li, ri], ensuring no two events occur on the same day.\\n- Data Structures and Sorting: Consider sorting the events based on their end dates (ri). This helps prioritize events with earlier deadlines, increasing the chances of finding a valid assignment.\\n- Algorithm Development: Iterate through the sorted events. For each event, attempt to assign the earliest possible date (li). If that date is already taken, increment the date until an available date within the range [li, ri] is found.\\n- Checking for Uniqueness: Use a set to keep track of assigned dates to ensure uniqueness.\\n- Output Generation: After assigning dates to all events, ensure the output is in the original order of the events.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you sort the events to efficiently find a solution, and why is sorting necessary?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: I would sort the events by their end dates (ri) because events with earlier end dates are more constrained.

Before assigning a date to an event, I check if the date is already in the set. If it is, I try the next date until I find one that is not in the set.\\n\",\n    \"If the earliest possible date (li) for an event is already taken, how do you find an alternative date within the range [li, ri]?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: If the earliest date is taken, I increment the date by one and check if the new date is within the range [li, ri] and not already taken. I continue incrementing and checking until I find an available date or exceed ri, which would indicate no possible assignment exists (but the problem guarantees a solution).\\n\",\n    \"How do you maintain the original order of the events in the output?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: I would store the original index of each event before sorting. After assigning dates, I sort the events back to their original order based on the stored index before printing the assigned dates.\\n\",\n    \"What data structures would be suitable for efficiently checking date availability, and why?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: A set data structure would be efficient for checking date availability. Sets provide O(1) average-case time complexity for checking if an element (date) is already present, which is much faster than using a list (O(n) time complexity).
