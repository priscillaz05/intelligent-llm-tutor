We need to traverse the tree level by level and calculate the sum of nodes at each level.\\n- Choosing an Algorithmic Strategy: A Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach using a queue is well-suited for level-order traversal. This allows us to visit nodes level by level and compute the sum for each level.\\n- Implementing Level-Order Traversal: Use a queue to store nodes at the current level. Iterate through the queue, processing each node by adding its value to the current level's sum and enqueueing its children (left and right, if they exist).\\n- Tracking the Maximum Sum: Maintain a variable to keep track of the maximum level sum encountered so far. After calculating the sum for each level, update the maximum sum if the current level's sum is greater than the current maximum.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What data structure is best suited for level-order traversal of a binary tree, and why?\",\n    \"How do you handle null or empty nodes when calculating the sum of a level?\",\n    \"How do you ensure that you are processing all nodes at the current level before moving to the next level?\",\n    \"What should be the initial value of the variable that keeps track of the maximum level sum, and why?\",\n    \"How do you handle binary trees that contain both positive and negative node values?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A queue is best suited for level-order traversal because it allows you to process nodes in a FIFO (First-In, First-Out) manner, ensuring that you visit nodes at each level before moving to the next.\",\n    \"When calculating the sum of a level, null or empty nodes should be skipped; they do not contribute to the sum. You can check if the node is null before adding its value to the level's sum.\",\n    \"To ensure that you are processing all nodes at the current level before moving to the next, use the length of the queue at the start of the level's processing as a counter, iterating through that many nodes.\",\n    \"Initialize the maximum level sum to negative infinity or the value of the root node. This ensures that the first level's sum will always be greater, thus correctly setting the initial maximum.\",\n    \"Since the tree contains positive and negative node values, the solution should handle them correctly by adding both positive and negative values to calculate the level sum. There are no special adjustments needed.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
