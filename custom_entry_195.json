To amuse himself, he decides to play the following game : he draws a sequence of N squares on the ground, numbered 1 to N, and writes an integer in each square. He starts at square k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 N). The game consists of one forward phase followed by one backward phase.\\n- In the forward phase, Calvin makes zero or more moves of the following type : if his current position is p, he can jump to p+1 or p+2 as long as he stays within the N squares.\\n- In the backward phase, Calvin makes zero or more moves of the following type : if his current position is p, he can jump to p\u22121 or p\u22122 as long as he stays within the N squares.\\nHe plays such that he finally ends up at square 1, and then he stops. He starts with a score of 0, and each time he jumps from square i to square j, he adds the integer written in square j to his score. Find the maximum score Calvin can obtain by playing this game. Recall that Calvin must start at square k and end at square 1. The integer on the square where he starts is not included in his score.\\nFor example, suppose N = 5 and the numbers in squares are 5, 3, \u22122, 1, 1. If k = 2, Calvin starts on the second square. He can make a forward move to square 4, another to square 5, a backward move to square 4, another to square 2, and another to square 1. His total score is 1+1+1+3+5 = 11. You can check that this is the maximum score possible.\\n\\n-----Input format-----\\n\u2022 Line 1 : Two space-separated integers, N and k, with 1 \u2264 k \u2264 N.\\n\u2022 Line 2 : A space-separated sequence of N integers, the numbers in squares 1, 2 . . . , N .\\n\\n-----Output format-----\\nA single line with a single integer, the maximum score Calvin can obtain by playing the game.\\n\\n-----Test Data-----\\nThe testdata is grouped into two subtasks with the following constraints on the inputs.\\n\u2022 Subtask 1 [30 points] : 1 \u2264 N \u2264 3000.\\n\u2022 Subtask 2 [70 points] : 1 \u2264 N \u2264 106.\\nIn all subtasks, the number in each square is between \u22121000 and 1000 inclusive.\\n\\n-----Example-----\\nHere is the sample input and output corresponding to the example above.\\n\\n-----Sample input-----\\n5 2\\n5 3 -2 1 1\\n\\n-----Sample output-----\\n11\\n\\nNote: Your program should not print anything other than what is specified in the output format.

Start at `k`, end at 1, and only the values of jumped squares are added to the score.\\n- Decompose Problem: The problem can be broken down into calculating the maximum possible score from `k` to `i` in the forward phase and from `i` to 1 in the backward phase, and then combining these to maximize the total score.\\n- Select Algorithmic Strategy: Dynamic programming seems suitable. Compute the best score to reach any square from `k` in the forward direction and from any square to 1 in the backward direction.\\n- Potential Pitfalls: Ensure proper handling of edge cases and array indices. Optimization is necessary to meet constraints for larger N. Be careful about double-counting the value of the square where the forward and backward phases meet.\\n- Implementation Details: Use two arrays `forward` and `backward` to store the maximum scores for the forward and backward phases respectively. Iterate through possible meeting points `i` to find the maximum combined score.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean to move in the 'forward phase' and 'backward phase', and how do the available jumps impact possible routes?\",\n    \"How would you use dynamic programming to calculate the maximum score for the forward and backward phases separately?\",\n    \"How should the algorithm handle the combination of forward and backward phases to avoid double-counting or missing optimal solutions?\",\n    \"How can the array indices be carefully managed to avoid index out of bounds errors, especially with jumps of 1 or 2 squares?\",\n    \"What optimizations can be employed to ensure the solution is efficient enough to handle the large constraints of up to N = 10^6?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Moving in the 'forward phase' means jumping from the starting square `k` to a higher-numbered square (p+1 or p+2), and in the 'backward phase' means moving from a square to a lower-numbered square (p-1 or p-2), both within the range 1 to N. The jumps determine the possible paths and thus affect the score.\",\n    \"For the forward phase, dp[i] = arr[i] + max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]), starting from k. Similarly, for the backward phase, dp[i] = arr[i] + max(dp[i+1], dp[i+2]), ending at 1. These recurrence relations calculate the maximum score to reach or from a square.\",\n    \"To combine the forward and backward phases, iterate through all possible meeting points `i` (where the transition happens). The maximum total score is `forward[i] + backward[i] - arr[i]`, subtracting `arr[i]` to correct for double-counting the meeting square's value.\",\n    \"Careful array indexing is crucial. Ensure that jumps stay within the array bounds (1 to N). Check conditions such as `i-1 >= 0` and `i+1 < N` before accessing those indices.\",\n    \"For N up to 10^6, an O(N) dynamic programming solution is needed. No nested loops or sorting should be performed during calculation of forward and backward arrays. The loop to determine `ans` is also linear, which maintains the efficient O(N) performance. Also, use appropriate data types to store the score (e.g., int) without overflow issues.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
