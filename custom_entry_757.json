This year he wants a Bracket sequence as a Birthday present. More specifically, he wants a bracket sequence so complex that no matter how hard he tries, he will not be able to remove a simple subsequence!\\n\\nWe say that a string formed by $n$ characters '(' or ')' is simple if its length $n$ is even and positive, its first $\\\\frac{n}{2}$ characters are '(', and its last $\\\\frac{n}{2}$ characters are ')'. For example, the strings () and (()) are simple, while the strings )( and ()() are not simple.\\n\\nKuroni will be given a string formed by characters '(' and ')' (the given string is not necessarily simple). An operation consists of choosing a subsequence of the characters of the string that forms a simple string and removing all the characters of this subsequence from the string. Note that this subsequence doesn't have to be continuous. For example, he can apply the operation to the string ')()(()))', to choose a subsequence of bold characters, as it forms a simple string '(())', delete these bold characters from the string and to get '))()'. \\n\\nKuroni has to perform the minimum possible number of operations on the string, in such a way that no more operations can be performed on the remaining string. The resulting string does not have to be empty.\\n\\nSince the given string is too large, Kuroni is unable to figure out how to minimize the number of operations. Can you help him do it instead?\\n\\nA sequence of characters $a$ is a subsequence of a string $b$ if $a$ can be obtained from $b$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe only line of input contains a string $s$ ($1 \\\\le |s| \\\\le 1000$) formed by characters '(' and ')', where $|s|$ is the length of $s$.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nIn the first line, print an integer $k$ \u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of operations you have to apply. Then, print $2k$ lines describing the operations in the following format:\\n\\nFor each operation, print a line containing an integer $m$ \u00a0\u2014 the number of characters in the subsequence you will remove.\\n\\nThen, print a line containing $m$ integers $1 \\\\le a_1 < a_2 < \\\\dots < a_m$ \u00a0\u2014 the indices of the characters you will remove. All integers must be less than or equal to the length of the current string, and the corresponding subsequence must form a simple string.\\n\\nIf there are multiple valid sequences of operations with the smallest $k$, you may print any of them.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n(()((\\n\\nOutput\\n1\\n2\\n1 3 \\n\\nInput\\n)(\\n\\nOutput\\n0\\n\\nInput\\n(()())\\n\\nOutput\\n1\\n4\\n1 2 5 6 \\n\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first sample, the string is '(()(('. The operation described corresponds to deleting the bolded subsequence. The resulting string is '(((', and no more operations can be performed on it. Another valid answer is choosing indices $2$ and $3$, which results in the same final string.\\n\\nIn the second sample, it is already impossible to perform any operations.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import sys\\ns = input()\\nj = len(s)\\nn = len(s)\\nans = []\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\tif i >= j:\\n\\t\\tbreak\\n\\tif s[i] == '(': \\n\\t\\twhile True:\\n\\t\\t\\tj -= 1\\n\\t\\t\\tif i >= j:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\t\\t\\tif s[j] == ')':\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tans.append(i)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tans.append(j)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbreak\\nif len(ans) == 0:\\n\\tprint(0)\\n\\tsys.exit()\\nelse:\\n\\tprint(1)\\nprint(len(ans))\\nans = [ans[i] + 1 for i in range(len(ans))]\\nans.sort()\\nprint(*ans)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the problem: The task is to find the minimum number of operations to remove simple bracket subsequences from a given string. A simple bracket sequence consists of n/2 '(' followed by n/2 ')'. The operations involve selecting a simple subsequence and removing it from the string. The goal is to minimize the number of operations until no further simple subsequences can be removed.\\n- Identifying the core logic: The algorithm should iteratively find and remove simple bracket subsequences until no such subsequences exist. One possible approach is to find matching '(' and ')' pairs and remove them in each operation. Since we want to minimize the number of operations, we want to find the longest possible simple sequence in each operation.\\n- Algorithm Design: The algorithm iterates through the string, looking for '(' characters. When it finds one, it searches for a matching ')' character to its right. If a match is found, it adds both indices to a list, effectively forming a simple sequence. After finding all such pairs, the algorithm outputs the number of operations (which will be 1 if any pairs were found, and 0 otherwise), the length of the sequence, and the sorted list of indices.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What defines a 'simple' bracket sequence, and why is it important to the problem?\",\n    \"How do you identify and extract a simple subsequence from a given string of brackets?\",\n    \"What is the core strategy for minimizing the number of operations needed to remove all possible simple subsequences?\",\n    \"How do you handle cases where no simple subsequences can be found in the given string?\",\n    \"What are the key steps for implementing the solution, and how can you ensure correct index handling when extracting subsequences?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A 'simple' bracket sequence is a string of even length where the first half consists of '(' and the second half consists of ')'.

In this case, the algorithm should output 0, indicating no operations are needed.\",\n    \"The key implementation steps are: 1) Iterate through the string. 2) Find matching '(' and ')' pairs. 3) Store the indices of these pairs. 4) Sort the indices. 5) Output the number of operations (1 if pairs were found, 0 otherwise), the length of the indices list, and the sorted list of indices + 1 (since the problem wants 1-based indices, and the code will likely use 0-based indices during processing).  Careful index management is essential to ensure the extracted subsequence is indeed simple and that indices are correctly tracked and adjusted.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
