Of course, she's proud of her achievments. But, to prepare herself for more complicated situations, she keeps challenging herself to handle tricky tasks.\\nHer current challenge involves the following things:\\n- A square matrix of the form N*N.  \\n- B bombs planted at various cells of the square matrix.\\n- There can be multiple bombs at a given cell. \\n- Only the four corners of the square matrix have a bomb defusor, so if a bomb is moved to any one of the four corners, it will be defused.\\n\\nFrom a given cell, any bomb can be moved in all the four directions, North, South, East, West respectively.\\n\\nRohu is given the number of bombs and the dimensions of the square matrix she's going to be dealing with, you've to help her figure out the minimum number of moves required to defuse all the bombs.\\n\\nNote-1: She's not going to enter the matrix, she's just going to move the bombs from outside. \\nNote-2: The matrix is 1-indexed. \\n\\n-----Input-----\\n- The first line of each test case contains two integers N, denoting the dimension of the square matrix, and B denoting the number of bombs. This will be followed by two lines, where the first line will denote the x-coordinate of all the bombs, and the second line will denote the y-coordinate of all the bombs. x[0], y[0] will be the position of the first bomb, ... , x[B-1], y[B-1] will be the position of the Bth bomb.\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n- Output a single line containing the minimum number of moves required.\\n\\n-----Subtasks-----\\n- 1 \u2264 N, B \u2264 100000: 50 points\\n\\n- 1 \u2264 N, B \u2264 1000: 30 points\\n\\n- 1 \u2264 N, B \u2264 10: 20 points\\n\\n-----Constraints-----\\n- 1 \u2264 N, B \u2264 100000\\n\\n-----Example 1-----\\nInput:\\n3 3\\n1 2 3\\n3 2 1\\n\\nOutput:\\n2\\n\\n-----Example 2-----\\nInput:\\n2 1\\n1\\n1\\n\\nOutput:\\n0\\n\\n-----Explanation-----\\nExample case 1:Only the bomb at {2,2} needs to be moved in two steps.\\nExample case 2:No bomb needs to be moved anywhere.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"(n, b) = list(map(int, input().split()))\\nx = list(map(int, input().split()))\\ny = list(map(int, input().split()))\\nans = 0\\nfor i in range(b):\\n\\tans += min(x[i] - 1, n - x[i]) + min(y[i] - 1, n - y[i])\\nprint(ans)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires finding the minimum number of moves to defuse all bombs in an N*N matrix by moving them to one of the four corners (1,1), (1,N), (N,1), (N,N).  The moves can be in North, South, East, and West directions.\\n- Optimizing Movements: The goal is to minimize the number of moves for each bomb individually.  The minimum moves for a single bomb located at (x, y) will be the minimum of moving it to the nearest corner.\\n- Algorithm Selection: For each bomb, calculate the moves required to reach each of the four corners. The minimum of these four values will be the minimum moves required to defuse that bomb. Accumulate these minimum moves for all bombs.\\n- Corner Cases: Edge cases, such as when a bomb is already at a corner (moves = 0), must be considered.  Also, the fact that there can be multiple bombs at the same cell should not affect the logic since we calculate the moves for each bomb separately.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the coordinates of the four corners of the matrix, and how can these be used to calculate the number of moves required to defuse a bomb?\",\n    \"Given a bomb at position (x, y) in an N x N matrix, how can you determine the minimum number of moves to reach any of the four corners?\",\n    \"What is the minimum number of moves required to move a bomb from a given location (x, y) to the corners (1,1), (1, N), (N, 1), and (N, N)?\",\n    \"How do you handle the case where a bomb is already at one of the corners?\",\n    \"How does the size of the matrix, N, affect the calculation of the minimum number of moves?\",\n    \"If there are multiple bombs at the same cell, how does this affect the calculation of the total number of moves required to defuse all the bombs?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The four corners of the matrix are (1, 1), (1, N), (N, 1), and (N, N). These corners represent the defusing locations. To calculate the moves, we consider the Manhattan distance (sum of absolute differences of coordinates) from the bomb's location to each corner.\",\n    \"For a bomb at (x, y), calculate the Manhattan distance to each corner: (1, 1), (1, N), (N, 1), and (N, N).
