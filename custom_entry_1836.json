Recognize that powers of 2 are at the end of the sequence and should be handled accordingly.\\n- Devising Comparison Strategy: Design a function that can determine the position of any given number within the Sharkovsky ordering. This would likely involve finding the largest power of 2 that divides the number and its odd factor.\\n- Implementing Lexicographical Comparison: Compare the numbers based on the power of 2 and the odd factor; powers of 2 should be compared in reverse order, and the odd factors should be compared in ascending order.
