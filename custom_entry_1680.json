You need to find for each query the sum of elements of the array with indexes from l_{i} to r_{i}, inclusive.\\n\\nThe little girl found the problem rather boring. She decided to reorder the array elements before replying to the queries in a way that makes the sum of query replies maximum possible. Your task is to find the value of this maximum sum.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b710^5) and q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 2\u00b710^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array and the number of queries, correspondingly.\\n\\nThe next line contains n space-separated integers a_{i} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 2\u00b710^5) \u2014 the array elements.\\n\\nEach of the following q lines contains two space-separated integers l_{i} and r_{i} (1 \u2264 l_{i} \u2264 r_{i} \u2264 n) \u2014 the i-th query.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nIn a single line print a single integer \u2014 the maximum sum of query replies after the array elements are reordered.\\n\\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n3 3\\n5 3 2\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n1 3\\n\\nOutput\\n25\\n\\nInput\\n5 3\\n5 2 4 1 3\\n1 5\\n2 3\\n2 3\\n\\nOutput\\n33\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"from sys import stdin, stdout\\n(n, m) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())\\nl = list(map(int, stdin.readline().split()))\\nl1 = [0] * n\\nfor i in range(m):\\n\\t(p, q) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())\\n\\tl1[p - 1] += 1\\n\\tif q != n:\\n\\t\\tl1[q] -= 1\\nc = 0\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\tc += l1[i]\\n\\tl1[i] = c\\nl1.sort()\\nl.sort()\\na = 0\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\ta += l[i] * l1[i]\\nstdout.write(str(a) + '\\\\n')\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem asks us to reorder the array elements to maximize the sum of query replies. Each query asks for the sum of elements within a given range.\\n- Identifying the Optimal Strategy: To maximize the sum, we should multiply the largest numbers in the array by the number of times they appear in all the queries. Thus, we need to determine the frequency of each index in all queries.\\n- Algorithm Selection: Calculate the frequency of each index by iterating through each query. A prefix sum-like array can efficiently compute the frequency. Sort both the original array and the frequency array in ascending order. Then, multiply corresponding elements and accumulate the sum.\\n- Edge Case Handling: There are no specific edge cases other than dealing with potentially large numbers. Ensure usage of appropriate data types.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you determine the number of times each element is included in the queries?\",\n    \"Why is sorting the array elements and their frequencies necessary for maximizing the sum?\",\n    \"How does using a prefix sum array contribute to an efficient solution?\",\n    \"What data types should be used to accommodate potentially large sums?\",\n    \"What happens if the indices in the query are not 1-based?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Iterate through the queries and increment a counter for each index within the query range.\",\n    \"Sorting allows us to pair the largest values in the array with the indices that appear most frequently, thereby maximizing the overall sum.\",\n    \"A prefix sum array allows efficient calculation of frequency by incrementing at the start index and decrementing at the end index, then calculating the cumulative sum. This reduces the calculation to O(n+q) time complexity.\",\n    \"64-bit integers should be used, such as 'long long' in C++ or standard integers in Python because the sum can grow large with array elements up to 2 * 10^5.\",\n    \"The provided solution assumes 1-based indexing. If it's 0-based, adjustments to index calculations (specifically, 'l1[p - 1] += 1' and 'l1[q] -= 1') will be needed to align with 0-based indices.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
