You have to make a number in such a way that it contains the first digit and last digit occurring in X^{1 }, X^{2 }, X^{3},  .... X^{N}.\\nFor Example: let's take  X=12 and N=5.\\nlet l is last digit and f is first digit.\\n12^{1  }= 12, the first digit of 12 is 1(f1) and last digit is 2 (l1).\\n12^{2} = 144, the first digit of 144 is 1 (f2) and last digit is 4 (l2).\\n12^{3} = 1728, the first digit of 1728 is 1 (f3) and last digit is 8  (l3).\\n12^{4} = 20736, the first digit of 20736 is 2 (f4) and last digit is 6 (l4).\\n12^{5} = 248832, the first digit of 248832 is 2 (f5) and last digit is 2 (l5).\\nWe made a number in the format f1 l1 f2 l2 f3 l3 f4 l4 f5 l5 .\\nso number becomes 1214182622.\\n \\nExample 1:\\nInput:\\nX = 10, N = 2\\nOutput:\\n1010\\nExplanation:\\n10^{1} = 10. So, f1=1 and l1=0\\n10^{2} = 100. So, f2=1 and l2=0\\nTherefore, Output is 1010.\\nExample 2:\\nInput:\\nX = 99, N = 1\\nOutput:\\n99\\nExplanation:\\n99^{1} = 99. So, f1=9 and l1=9\\nTherefore, Output is 99.\\n \\nYour Task:\\nYou don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function powerGame() which takes 2 Integers X and N as input and returns the answer.\\n \\nExpected Time Complexity: O(N*(Sum of number of digits in X^{1}, X^{2}..., X^{N}))\\nExpected Auxiliary Space: O(1)\\n \\nConstraints:\\n10 <= X <= 100\\n1 <= N <= 8\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"class Solution:\\n\\n\\tdef powerGame(self, X, N):\\n\\t\\tnew_number = ''\\n\\t\\tfor i in range(1, N + 1):\\n\\t\\t\\tnumber = X ** i\\n\\t\\t\\tnew_number = new_number + str(number)[0] + str(number)[-1]\\n\\t\\treturn new_number\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding Problem Constraints: The problem requires calculating powers of X from 1 to N, extracting the first and last digits of each power, and concatenating these digits into a single string.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Be mindful of large numbers that might result from exponentiation and ensure the correct extraction of the first and last digits.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Iterate from 1 to N, calculate X to the power of i, convert the result to a string, extract the first and last characters/digits, and append to the result string.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Convert the numbers to strings for easy extraction of the first and last digits.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the approach to extract the first and last digit of a number?\",\n    \"How should the extracted digits be combined to form the final output?\",\n    \"What are the potential issues with large numbers resulting from the power calculation?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Convert the number to a string and extract the character at index 0 and index -1.\",\n    \"Concatenate the first and last digits as strings.\",\n    \"For the given constraints the result from power calculation should be within the range of integer therefore no issue of integer overflow.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
