But the problem is that Benny doesn't know how to reach to the gift shop. Her friend Mike has created a special set of instructions for her. \\nA set of instructions is a string which consists of letters {'L', 'R', 'U', 'D'}. \\n\\nFor simplicity, let's assume that Benny is staying at point (0, 0) on the infinite plane. She consistently fulfills all the instructions written by Mike. Let's assume that now she is staying at point (X, Y).  Then depending on what is the current instruction she moves in some direction: \\n'L' -- from  (X, Y) moves to point (X, Y - 1)\\n'R' -- from  (X, Y) moves to point (X, Y + 1)\\n'U' -- from  (X, Y) moves to point (X - 1, Y)\\n'D' -- from (X, Y) moves to point (X + 1, Y)\\n\\nThe weather is cold because it's winter now. Initially, all points are snowy. But if Benny have already visited some point at any time this point becomes icy (because Benny has just taken a shower). Every time, when Benny makes a step into icy points she slips and falls down.\\n\\nYou are given a string S which denotes a set of instructions for Benny. Your task is to calculate how may times she will fall down.\\n\\nInput format\\n\\nSingle line contains string S.\\n\\nOutput format\\n\\nOutput how many times Benny will fall down.\\n\\nConstraints\\n\\n- 1 \u2264\\nS\\n\u2264 10^5\\nSAMPLE INPUT\\nRRULDL\\n\\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\\n2\\n\\nExplanation\\n\\nBenny's route consists of points \\n\\n0 0 (becomes icy) --> 0 1 (becomes icy) --> 0 2 (becomes icy) --> -1 2 (becomes icy) --> -1 1 (becomes icy) --> 0 1 (is icy) --> 0 0 (is icy)\\n\\nSo Benny made two steps into icy points.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"# Hacker Earth\\n# Problem Statement\\n# 'L' -- from (X, Y) moves to point (X, Y - 1)\\n# 'R' -- from (X, Y) moves to point (X, Y + 1)\\n# 'U' -- from (X, Y) moves to point (X - 1, Y)\\n# 'D' -- from (X, Y) moves to point (X + 1, Y)\\n\\n# Import libraries\\nimport sys\\nimport pdb\\n\\ndef findBennyFallCount(myCommand):\\n\\t# initialization\\n\\tfallCount = 0\\n\\tcurrentX = 0\\n\\tcurrentY = 0\\n\\tvisitedLocaiton = {}\\n\\tvisitedLocaiton[currentX] = []\\n\\tvisitedLocaiton[currentX].append(currentY)\\n\\t\\n\\t# process the command\\n\\tfor cmd in myCommand:\\n\\t\\t# update current location based on the command received\\n\\t\\tif cmd == 'L':\\n\\t\\t\\tcurrentY -= 1\\n\\t\\tif cmd == 'R':\\n\\t\\t\\tcurrentY += 1\\n\\t\\tif cmd == 'U':\\n\\t\\t\\tcurrentX -= 1\\n\\t\\tif cmd == 'D':\\n\\t\\t\\tcurrentX += 1\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tpass\\n\\t\\t# Update visited location and fall count\\n\\t\\tif currentX in visitedLocaiton:\\n\\t\\t\\tif currentY in visitedLocaiton[currentX]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfallCount += 1\\n\\t\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvisitedLocaiton[currentX].append(currentY)\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tvisitedLocaiton[currentX] = []\\n\\t\\t\\tvisitedLocaiton[currentX].append(currentY)\\n\\treturn(fallCount)\\n\\n\\ndef getOneLine(inFile):\\n\\tif inFile != \\\"\\\":\\n\\t\\treturn(inFile.readline().rstrip())\\n\\treturn(sys.stdin.readline().rstrip())\\n\\n\\ndef main():\\n\\t\\n\\t# Toggle mode of input\\n\\t# inFile = open(\\\"input5.txt\\\", 'r')\\n\\tinFile = \\\"\\\"\\n\\t\\n\\t# number of cases\\n\\tmyCommand = getOneLine(inFile)\\n\\t\\n\\t# Result string\\n\\tresult = findBennyFallCount(myCommand)\\n\\tresult = str(result)\\n\\t\\n\\t# print the output\\n\\tsys.stdout.write(result)\\n\\tif inFile != \\\"\\\":\\n\\t\\tinFile.close()\\n\\t\\n\\t\\nmain()\\n\\n# Simple test case\\n# RRULDL\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires simulating Benny's movement based on a sequence of instructions (L, R, U, D) on a 2D plane. The goal is to count the number of times Benny steps on a previously visited location.\\n- Data Structures: A dictionary (or hash map) can be used to store the coordinates Benny has visited. This allows for efficient checking of previously visited locations.\\n- Algorithm: Iterate through the instruction string. For each instruction, update Benny's current coordinates. Check if the new coordinates are already in the visited locations dictionary. If they are, increment the fall count. Otherwise, add the new coordinates to the visited locations dictionary.\\n- Edge Cases: The starting point (0, 0) should be considered visited before any instructions are processed.\\n- Coordinate Updates: 'L' decrements the Y coordinate, 'R' increments the Y coordinate, 'U' decrements the X coordinate, and 'D' increments the X coordinate.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you efficiently keep track of visited locations to determine if Benny falls?\",\n    \"How should you handle the initial position (0, 0) before processing any instructions?\",\n    \"What data structure is best suited for storing and checking visited coordinates?\",\n    \"How should the coordinates be updated based on each instruction (L, R, U, D)?\",\n    \"How do you increment the 'fallCount' only when a previously visited location is encountered?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A dictionary (or hash map) can efficiently store visited coordinates as keys, allowing for quick lookups to determine if a location has been visited before.\",\n    \"The initial position (0, 0) should be added to the visited locations set before processing any instructions to correctly identify the first fall if Benny returns to (0,0).\",\n    \"A dictionary is suitable because it offers fast lookups (O(1) on average) to check if a coordinate pair has been visited.\",\n    \"'L' should decrement the Y coordinate, 'R' should increment the Y coordinate, 'U' should decrement the X coordinate, and 'D' should increment the X coordinate.\",\n    \"The 'fallCount' should be incremented only when the current coordinates are found to already exist as a key in the visited coordinates dictionary during the iteration through instructions.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
