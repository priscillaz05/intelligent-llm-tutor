Then, compare the maximum loot from these two scenarios.\\n- Applying Dynamic Programming: Apply dynamic programming to each subproblem. At each house, decide whether to rob it or not, based on which decision yields the most loot without robbing adjacent houses.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Address the base cases where the input list is empty or contains only one house. If the list is empty, return 0; if it has only one house, return the amount in that house.\\n- Maximizing Total Loot: After solving each subproblem using dynamic programming, return the maximum loot obtained from both cases.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does the circular arrangement of houses affect the solution strategy compared to a linear arrangement?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: The circular arrangement means that robbing the first house makes it impossible to rob the last house, and vice versa, which requires splitting the problem into two separate scenarios.\",\n    \"How can you break down the problem into smaller, manageable subproblems?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: By considering two cases: one where the first house is robbed (and the last is not) and another where the last house is robbed (and the first is not).\",\n    \"How would you apply dynamic programming to determine the maximum loot for each subproblem?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: I would use two variables, 'now' and 'prev', to represent the maximum loot up to the current house, considering whether or not to rob it.\",\n    \"What edge cases should be considered, and how do they affect the algorithm's behavior?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: Edge cases include an empty list of houses (return 0) and a list with only one house (return the loot from that house).\",\n    \"How does the algorithm ensure that adjacent houses are not robbed?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: The algorithm updates 'now' and 'prev' such that the current house is only robbed if it yields a higher loot than not robbing it, while ensuring that 'prev' represents the loot from two houses ago.\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Expected Answer: The circular arrangement means that robbing the first house makes it impossible to rob the last house, and vice versa, which requires splitting the problem into two separate scenarios.\",\n    \"Expected Answer: By considering two cases: one where the first house is robbed (and the last is not) and another where the last house is robbed (and the first is not).\",\n    \"Expected Answer: I would use two variables, 'now' and 'prev', to represent the maximum loot up to the current house, considering whether or not to rob it.\",\n    \"Expected Answer: Edge cases include an empty list of houses (return 0) and a list with only one house (return the loot from that house).\",\n    \"Expected Answer: The algorithm updates 'now' and 'prev' such that the current house is only robbed if it yields a higher loot than not robbing it, while ensuring that 'prev' represents the loot from two houses ago.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
