The key determines the order in which the columns of the message are arranged during encoding. The task is to reverse this process to retrieve the original message.\\n- Generating the Numeric Key: The first step involves converting the input key into a numeric key. This is done by sorting the characters of the key alphabetically and then determining the original index of each character in the unsorted key. For example, if the key is 'crazy', sorting it gives 'acryz', and the numeric key becomes '23154' as 'c' was at index 2, 'r' at index 3, 'a' at index 1, 'z' at index 5, and 'y' at index 4 in the sorted sequence.\\n- Decoding the Message: The encoded message is treated as a grid of characters, with the number of columns equal to the length of the key. The decoding process involves reordering the columns according to the numeric key and then concatenating the columns to form the decoded message.\\n- Handling Trailing Whitespace: Finally, any trailing whitespace at the end of the decoded message needs to be removed.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How is the numeric key generated from the input key, and what purpose does it serve in decoding the message?\",\n    \"How is the encoded message structured into a grid, and how does the length of the key influence this structure?\",\n    \"What steps are involved in reordering the columns of the grid, and how does the numeric key guide this process?\",\n    \"Why is it necessary to remove trailing whitespace from the decoded message, and how does this impact the overall result?\",\n    \"Are there any edge cases or constraints to consider while implementing the decoding function?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The numeric key is generated by sorting the characters of the input key alphabetically and then determining the original index of each character in the unsorted key. This numeric key specifies the order in which the columns need to be rearranged to decode the message.\",\n    \"The encoded message is structured into a grid with the number of columns equal to the length of the key. The message is filled in row by row, and any remaining spaces are filled with whitespace characters.\",\n    \"Reordering the columns involves rearranging them according to the order specified by the numeric key. For example, if the numeric key is '23154', then the columns should be rearranged such that column 2 comes first, followed by column 3, then column 1, then column 5, and finally column 4.\",\n    \"Removing trailing whitespace is necessary to ensure that the decoded message is clean and free from extraneous characters. The encoded message might have been padded with whitespace, and the decoding process might introduce additional whitespace at the end.\",\n    \"Consider the length of the message being shorter than the key length; proper handling should be implemented for this case to prevent out-of-bounds access. Also the key should contain unique letters and digits, as stated in the problem description.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
