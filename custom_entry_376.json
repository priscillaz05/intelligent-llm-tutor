Points are given as (x, y) coordinates, and queries specify a rectangular range (sx, tx, sy, ty). The output should be a sorted list of the indices of the points within the range.\\n- Data Structure Choice: A KD-tree is an efficient data structure for range search problems in multi-dimensional spaces. However, the ground truth solution uses a different approach that partitions the space based on x-coordinates into sqrt(n) blocks and then sorts the y-coordinates within each block. This leverages bisect_left and bisect_right for efficient searching.\\n- Preprocessing: Sort the points by their x-coordinates. Divide the sorted points into blocks of size sqrt(n). For each block, sort the points by their y-coordinates.\\n- Query Processing: For each query, find the blocks of points that potentially intersect the x-range [sx, tx]. Then, for each block, perform a binary search on the y-coordinates to find the points within the y-range [sy, ty]. Finally, filter the points found in each block to only include those within the specified x and y ranges, collecting the indices of these points.\\n- Output: Sort the collected indices in ascending order and print them, one per line, followed by a blank line after each query.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you efficiently find points within a rectangular range in a 2D plane, given the constraints and input format?\",\n    \"What preprocessing steps can you perform on the input points to optimize the range search queries?\",\n    \"How does the chosen data structure divide the space, and how does this division aid in efficient range searching?\",\n    \"Given a query range [sx, tx, sy, ty], how can you efficiently identify the relevant blocks or sections of your data structure to search within?\",\n    \"After identifying the relevant blocks, how can you efficiently find the points within each block that fall within the specified y-range [sy, ty] and ensure they are also within the x-range [sx, tx]?\",\n    \"How should the resulting indices be formatted and printed according to the problem's output specifications?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"By first sorting points by x-coordinate, dividing them into blocks of sqrt(n), and sorting within each block by y-coordinate. Then, by using binary search to identify relevant blocks based on sx and tx and searching y-coordinates within each block based on sy and ty.\",\n    \"Sort the points primarily by x-coordinate and then, within each block of sqrt(n) points based on x-coordinate, sort by y-coordinate.\",\n    \"The ground truth solution approach divides the space into vertical strips based on the sorted x-coordinates, with each strip containing sqrt(n) points, sorted by x.  Within each strip, the points are then sorted by their y-coordinates.  This combines space partitioning with sorting to enable efficient range queries using binary search within each strip.\",\n    \"By using binary search (bisect_left and bisect_right) on the low and high x-coordinate values of the blocks to find the blocks that potentially intersect the x-range [sx, tx].\",\n    \"Perform a binary search on the sorted y-coordinates within each relevant block to find points within the range [sy, ty].
