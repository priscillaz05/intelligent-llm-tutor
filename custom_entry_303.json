You may go for a cup of coffee or go take a nap while you wait for the answer. But if you try it here in Code Wars you will most likely get a code timeout before any answers.\\n\\nFor this particular Kata we want to **implement the memoization solution**. This will be cool because it will let us *keep using the tree recursion* algorithm while still keeping it sufficiently optimized to get an answer very rapidly.\\n\\nThe trick of the memoized version is that we will keep a cache data structure (most likely an associative array) where we will store the Fibonacci numbers as we calculate them. When a Fibonacci number is calculated, we first look it up in the cache, if it's not there, we calculate it and put it in the cache, otherwise we returned the cached number.\\n\\nRefactor the function into a recursive Fibonacci function that using  a memoized data structure avoids the deficiencies of tree recursion Can you make it so the memoization cache is private to this function?\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def memoized(f):\\n\\tcache = {}\\n\\n\\tdef wrapped(k):\\n\\t\\tv = cache.get(k)\\n\\t\\tif v is None:\\n\\t\\t\\tv = cache[k] = f(k)\\n\\t\\treturn v\\n\\treturn wrapped\\n\\n@memoized\\ndef fibonacci(n):\\n\\tif n in [0, 1]:\\n\\t\\treturn n\\n\\treturn fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding Problem Deficiencies: Recognize the inefficiency of the basic recursive Fibonacci calculation, stemming from redundant calculations in overlapping subproblems.\\n- Identifying Memoization as a Solution: Understand that memoization involves caching previously computed values to avoid recomputation.\\n- Implementing a Memoization Decorator: Construct a decorator that creates and manages a private cache for storing Fibonacci numbers.\\n- Applying the Decorator: Apply the memoization decorator to the recursive Fibonacci function.\\n- Ensuring Correctness and Performance: Test the memoized Fibonacci function to verify its correctness and improved performance.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the primary cause of inefficiency in a naive recursive Fibonacci implementation, and how does memoization address this?\",\n    \"How can a decorator be used to add memoization to a function, and why is this approach suitable for keeping the cache private?\",\n    \"What steps are involved in creating a memoization decorator, and how does it interact with the original function?\",\n    \"How does the memoization decorator check if a value is already cached, and how does it retrieve or compute the value?\",\n    \"Why is it important to keep the cache private to the memoized Fibonacci function, and how does the decorator achieve this?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The primary cause of inefficiency is the redundant calculation of overlapping subproblems.
