The final answer is the sum of magic fractions for each number from 1 to N.\\n- Identifying Key Properties: A magic fraction a/b must be a proper fraction (a < b), irreducible (gcd(a,b) = 1), and its numerator and denominator must multiply to N!.\\n- Devising a Counting Strategy: Build an array `ans` to store the number of magic fractions for each number from 1 to N.  Iterate from 2 to N. If a number `i` is prime, then the number of magic fractions for `i` is twice the number of magic fractions for `i-1`. If it is not prime, the number of magic fractions is the same as that for `i-1`.\\n- Accounting for the base cases: The number of magic fractions for N=1 is 0 and for N=2 is 1.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you determine if a fraction is a valid magic fraction?\",\n    \"How should the count of magic fractions be aggregated across all numbers from 1 to N?\",\n    \"How does knowing whether a number is prime affect the number of magic fractions possible for that number?\",\n    \"What are the base cases for computing the number of magic fractions, and how do they impact the iterative or recursive calculation?\",\n    \"How do you handle the input and output according to the problem statement, including the input range and the expected output format?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A fraction a/b is a valid magic fraction if it's a proper fraction (a < b), irreducible (gcd(a,b) = 1), and the product of its numerator and denominator equals N!.\",\n    \"You need to calculate the number of magic fractions for each number from 1 to N and then sum up all these counts to get the final answer.\",\n    \"If a number is prime, it introduces a new factor in the factorial, doubling the number of possible magic fractions compared to the previous number.
