Now, given the Teemo's attacking ascending time series towards Ashe and the poisoning time duration per Teemo's attacking, you need to output the total time that Ashe is in poisoned condition.\\n\\nYou may assume that Teemo attacks at the very beginning of a specific time point, and makes Ashe be in poisoned condition immediately.\\n\\nExample 1:\\n\\nInput: [1,4], 2\\nOutput: 4\\nExplanation: At time point 1, Teemo starts attacking Ashe and makes Ashe be poisoned immediately. This poisoned status will last 2 seconds until the end of time point 2. And at time point 4, Teemo attacks Ashe again, and causes Ashe to be in poisoned status for another 2 seconds. So you finally need to output 4.\\n\\n\\n\\nExample 2:\\n\\nInput: [1,2], 2\\nOutput: 3\\nExplanation: At time point 1, Teemo starts attacking Ashe and makes Ashe be poisoned. This poisoned status will last 2 seconds until the end of time point 2. However, at the beginning of time point 2, Teemo attacks Ashe again who is already in poisoned status. Since the poisoned status won't add up together, though the second poisoning attack will still work at time point 2, it will stop at the end of time point 3. So you finally need to output 3.\\n\\n\\n\\nNote:\\n\\nYou may assume the length of given time series array won't exceed 10000.\\nYou may assume the numbers in the Teemo's attacking time series and his poisoning time duration per attacking are non-negative integers, which won't exceed 10,000,000.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"class Solution:\\n\\n\\tdef findPoisonedDuration(self, timeSeries, duration):\\n\\t\\tif not timeSeries:\\n\\t\\t\\treturn 0\\n\\t\\tprev = timeSeries[0]\\n\\t\\tret = 0\\n\\t\\tcount = 0\\n\\t\\tfor t in timeSeries[1:]:\\n\\t\\t\\tdiff = t - prev\\n\\t\\t\\tif diff > duration:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcount += 1\\n\\t\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tret += diff\\n\\t\\t\\tprev = t\\n\\t\\tret += (count + 1) * duration\\n\\t\\treturn ret\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires calculating the total poisoned time given a series of attack times and a poisoning duration. Overlapping poison durations do not stack; instead, the poison effect is refreshed.\\n- Edge Cases: Consider cases where the attack time series is empty, or the duration is zero.\\n- Iterative Calculation: Iterate through the attack time series, calculate the effective poison time for each attack, and sum these times to get the total poisoned duration.\\n- Overlap Handling: When an attack occurs before the previous poison effect wears off, calculate the overlap and only add the non-overlapping time to the total duration.\\n- Final Duration: Handle the last attack in the time series carefully; it will always contribute the full duration to the total.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What should the function return if the input `timeSeries` is empty?\",\n    \"If an attack occurs while Ashe is already poisoned, how should the poisoned duration be handled?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the poisoned duration when two attacks are separated by more than the poisoning duration?\",\n    \"How do you handle the last attack in the `timeSeries` to ensure the correct poisoned duration is calculated?\",\n    \"If duration is zero, what should be the return value?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"If the `timeSeries` is empty, the function should return 0 because there are no attacks and thus no poisoned duration.\",\n    \"If an attack occurs while Ashe is already poisoned, the poisoned duration is extended from the time of the new attack but only up to the original duration from the first attack in the series. The total contribution to the overall duration is equal to the difference in attack times.\",\n    \"When two attacks are separated by more than the poisoning duration, the total poisoned duration increases by the full poisoning duration each time.\",\n    \"The last attack always adds the full duration unless another attack occurs within the duration of the attack.\",\n    \"If the duration is zero then the return value should be zero\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
