If a node is unreachable, the distance should be -1. The output should be the distances to all nodes except the starting node, in increasing order of their node number.\\n- Data Structures: A dictionary can represent the graph, where keys are nodes and values are dictionaries of adjacent nodes and edge weights. A list can store the calculated shortest distances.\\n- Algorithm Selection: Dijkstra's algorithm is suitable for finding the shortest paths in a graph. It involves maintaining a priority queue of nodes to visit, based on their current shortest distance from the start node.\\n- Handling Unreachable Nodes: Initialize the distances to all nodes as -1. During Dijkstra's algorithm, if a node's distance remains -1 after processing all reachable nodes, it means it's unreachable.\\n- Edge Cases: The graph could be disconnected, or there might be multiple edges between the same nodes with different weights. Handle these by taking the minimum weight in the update function. The start node should be excluded from the output.\\n- Output Formatting: Print the shortest distances to the $n-1$ nodes (excluding the start node) separated by spaces.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you represent the graph structure in code to efficiently store and access nodes and edges?\",\n    \"What algorithm is most appropriate for finding the shortest paths in a weighted graph, and why?\",\n    \"How should the data structures be initialized to handle the case where some nodes are unreachable from the starting node?\",\n    \"How can you modify Dijkstra's algorithm to efficiently manage the set of unvisited nodes and prioritize nodes with shorter distances?\",\n    \"What steps are necessary to format the output according to the problem's requirements, ensuring that the correct distances are printed in the correct order?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A dictionary where keys are node numbers and values are dictionaries representing adjacent nodes and their associated edge weights is an effective way to represent the graph.
