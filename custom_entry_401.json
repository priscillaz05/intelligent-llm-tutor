Given a pair of traversal, return true if it is possible to construct unique binary tree from the given traversals otherwise return false.\\nEach traversal is represented with an integer: preorder - 1, inorder - 2, postorder - 3.   \\nExample 1:\\nInput:\\na = 1, b=2\\nOutput: 1\\nExplanation: We can construct binary tree using inorder traversal and preorder traversal. \\nExample 2:\\nInput: a = 1, b=3\\nOutput: 0 \\nExplanation: We cannot construct binary tree using preorder traversal and postorder traversal. \\nConstraints:\\n1 <= a,b <=3\\nYour Task:\\nYou don't need to read input or print anything.

The valid combinations are preorder and inorder, or postorder and inorder.\",\n    \"Inorder traversal is essential because it provides the relative order of the left and right subtrees with respect to the root, which is necessary to uniquely reconstruct the tree in combination with preorder or postorder.\",\n    \"Yes, some combinations are impossible. For example, only preorder and postorder cannot uniquely define a binary tree since they don't provide enough information about the relative positions of nodes and subtrees without inorder.\",\n    \"The integer representation is used as shorthand for different traversals: 1 for preorder, 2 for inorder, and 3 for postorder. This representation allows the code to easily check which types of traversals are provided as input.\",\n    \"You can check if one of the traversals is inorder (represented by 2) and both traversals are not inorder at the same time.
