This involves calculating the anchor day for the century, adjusting for leap years, and accounting for the specific month.\\n- Break Down the Algorithm:\\n  - Define functions for calculating the anchor day of the century, determining if a year is a leap year, finding the doomsday for a given month, and finding the number of days in a month.\\n  - Calculate the weekday of the doomsday for the given year.\\n  - Find the difference between the first day of the month and the doomsday.\\n  - Determine the first Sunday of the month and generate the sequence of Sundays.\\n- Address Constraints: Make sure to handle potential edge cases and ensure the year and month fall within the defined ranges.\\n- Optimize and Debug: Review the logic to avoid errors in date calculation.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you determine the anchor day for a given century, and why is this important for calculating the day of the week?\",\n    \"How does the leap year status affect the calculation, and how do you account for it in determining Sundays?\",\n    \"Can you explain the Doomsday algorithm's core concept and how it simplifies finding the weekday of any date?\",\n    \"How do you ensure the generated Sunday dates stay within the number of days in the given month, considering leap years?\",\n    \"What are potential edge cases, and how do you ensure your code handles the constraints provided (year range, month value)?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The anchor day is based on the century. It's calculated using a formula based on the century modulo 4. This serves as a reference point for the Doomsday algorithm, as it gives us a known day of the week for a particular date in that century.\",\n    \"Leap years shift the Doomsday for January and February. In a leap year, January's Doomsday is January 4 and February's is February 29. This shift needs to be considered when calculating the first Sunday of those months.\",\n    \"The Doomsday algorithm finds a specific 'doomsday' in each year. From this 'doomsday,' you can easily calculate the day of the week for any other date in that year by counting the number of days between the target date and the 'doomsday.'\",\n    \"By using the number of days in the given month as an upper bound.  The loop generating Sundays should stop when the calculated Sunday exceeds the total days in the month. This is done in the code through the condition `i <= days_month(month, leap_year(year))`.\",\n    \"Edge cases can include invalid month values or years outside the constraints. Ensure you can parse the input values correctly and that the year is within 2000-5000 and the month is not greater than 12. Input validation is critical.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
