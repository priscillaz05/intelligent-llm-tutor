The goal is to find the minimum specialty (sum of all cells) of such a matrix, given its dimensions N x M.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints and Simplifications: Since we want to minimize the specialty, we need to find the configuration of 1s in the matrix that satisfies the special matrix condition while minimizing the total number of 1s.  We observe the symmetry between rows and columns, if m < n, we reduce the problem to n = m. \\n- Devising a Strategy: The core idea is to create a matrix where the row sums and column sums are equal. This can be achieved by arranging 1s along the diagonal in a specific manner. We determine 'i' which is the maximal value such that sum of first 'i' natural numbers is less than or equal to min(N, M),  We calculate the specialty r by calculating the sum of squares from 1 to i, and adjust based on (N-s), where s is sum of the first i natural numbers.\\n- Implementing the Solution: The code calculates 'i' and then computes the minimum specialty 'r' based on the sums of consecutive numbers derived from 'i' and how it relates to N (or M, whichever is smaller).\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the definition of a 'special' matrix, and what condition must each cell satisfy?\",\n    \"Why are we trying to minimize the 'specialty' of the matrix, and how does it relate to the number of 1s in the matrix?\",\n    \"If N and M are different, how does that affect the problem, and what simplification can be made?\",\n    \"What are the steps to construct a matrix such that the matrix is special and has a minimal specialty?\",\n    \"How does the value 'i' which corresponds to the maximal value such that sum of first i natural number is less than or equal to N ( or M ) affect your solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A 'special' matrix is a binary matrix where A[i][j] = 1 if and only if the sum of the i-th row equals the sum of the j-th column.\",\n    \"We aim to minimize the specialty because it's the sum of all the cells, which directly corresponds to the number of 1s in the matrix. Minimizing the number of 1s while still satisfying the special matrix condition will give us the minimum specialty.\",\n    \"If N and M are different, we can take the minimum of N and M, since any excess rows or columns will contribute zeros and not affect the minimum specialty.  In effect we reduce the bigger one to that of the smaller of the two, since the question allows the matrix to not be of size N * M.\",\n    \"To construct a matrix that's special and has minimal specialty, try to arrange 1s such that row sums equal column sums. One way is to start with the main diagonal and potentially distribute 1s in a pattern that minimizes the overall count.\",\n    \"The value i is an important number as it identifies how many rows and columns can have consecutive numbers (1, 2, 3, ...) of ones, and based on N(or M) - sum of first i natural numbers how much adjustment is necessary based on calculating r.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
