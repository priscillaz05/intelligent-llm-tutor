The shock absorbers are gone and you think it can handle about 15 more bumps before it dies totally.\\n\\nUnfortunately for you, your drive is very bumpy! Given a string showing either flat road (\\\"_\\\") or bumps (\\\"n\\\"), work out if you make it home safely. 15 bumps or under, return \\\"Woohoo!\\\", over 15 bumps return \\\"Car Dead\\\".\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def bumps(road):\\n\\treturn 'Woohoo!' if road.count('n') <= 15 else 'Car Dead'\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding Problem Requirements: Read the problem carefully and understand the conditions for the car to survive the drive. Extract information about the maximum number of bumps the car can handle and the return string based on the number of bumps encountered.\\n- Formulating an Approach: Come up with a way to count the bumps, i.e., the occurrences of the character 'n' in the string, then return the correct string based on whether the number of bumps is greater than 15.\\n- Considering Edge Cases: Think about edge cases like an empty string or a string with no bumps and how these cases affect the number of bumps. Acknowledge that these edge cases should not affect the normal operation of the algorithm, but they can affect the string passed in.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you count the number of bumps in the road string?\",\n    \"What should the function return if the number of bumps is less than or equal to 15?\",\n    \"What should the function return if the number of bumps is greater than 15?\",\n    \"How does the function handle an empty input string?\",\n    \"How can this solution be expressed concisely using a conditional expression (ternary operator)?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"You can count the number of bumps by counting the occurrences of the character 'n' in the road string.\",\n    \"If the number of bumps is less than or equal to 15, the function should return 'Woohoo!'\",\n    \"If the number of bumps is greater than 15, the function should return 'Car Dead'.\",\n    \"An empty input string would result in zero bumps being counted, and it will still return the correct result Woohoo! since it would be less than 15.\",\n    \"This solution can be expressed concisely as a ternary conditional:  `return 'Woohoo!' if road.count('n') <= 15 else 'Car Dead'`\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
