You can do the following operations on that array:\\n\\nRemove the leftmost element of the array, with index l, for the cost A_{l}. This can be done any number of times if the array is non-empty (has at least 1 element).\\nRemove the rightmost element of the array, with index r, for the cost A_{r}. This can be done any number of times if the array is non-empty (has at least 1 element).\\nRemove both the leftmost and rightmost element, with indexes l and r respectively, for a fixed cost X which is given. This operation can only be done K times and only if the array has at least 2 elements left.\\n\\nIf the array has only 1 element left, then the rightmost element is the same as the leftmost element so the first and second operations will have the same cost.\\n\\nYou have to print the minimum cost to *clear the array* (remove all elements using one of the three operations above).\\n\\nNOTE: The answer may not fit in 32-bit integers, so please use 64-bit data types in your programming language.\\n\\n------ Input Format ------ \\n\\n- The first line of the input contains T - the number of test cases.

Then we can do the third operation to remove $10$ and $13$ for cost $7$, which makes the array $[11, 12]$. We can again do the third operation to remove $11$ and $12$ for cost $7$ which clears the array.\\n\\nThe total cost is therefore $23$, which is the minimum cost possible.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"for _ in range(int(input())):\\n\\t(n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())\\n\\tl = list(map(int, input().split()))\\n\\tl.sort()\\n\\tl.reverse()\\n\\t(i, j) = (0, 1)\\n\\t(cs, ans) = (sum(l), sum(l))\\n\\twhile k > 0:\\n\\t\\tp = l[i] + l[i + 1]\\n\\t\\tcs -= p\\n\\t\\tif j * x + cs < ans:\\n\\t\\t\\tans = j * x + cs\\n\\t\\ti += 2\\n\\t\\tj += 1\\n\\t\\tk -= 1\\n\\tprint(ans)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem asks to find the minimum cost to clear an array by removing elements from either end or both ends at a fixed cost, with a limit on the number of combined removals.\\n- Identifying Operations: There are three possible operations: remove the leftmost element, remove the rightmost element, or remove both. Removing both has a limited count `K` and fixed cost `X`.\\n- Defining Constraints: The goal is to minimize the total cost by strategically using these operations. The input array elements and fixed cost `X` can be up to 10^9, so 64-bit integers are required.\\n- Exploring Edge Cases: Need to handle the case where the array contains only one element, in which case left and right removals are equivalent. Also consider cases where K=0 or K is large enough to remove almost all elements in pairs.\\n- Formulating a Strategy: Try all combinations of the number of combined removals, from 0 to K. Calculate the remaining elements needed to be removed individually from left and right. Choose the combination which minimizes the cost.\\n- Optimization Considerations: Since N can be up to 5000, an O(N*K) solution should be efficient enough. Specifically consider edge cases where k is actually greater than n/2 in the cases where n is small. Also sorting might not be the ideal approach here, the problem can be solved by only doing removals from left and right end and choosing the optimal split.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the significance of the constraint that the array must be cleared, and how does it affect the choice of operations?\",\n    \"How should the condition K <= N/2 be utilized to optimize the solution, and what happens if K exceeds this limit?\",\n    \"What is the optimal approach to combining single element removals (left or right) with combined removals to minimize the total cost, considering that the array A consists of only positive integers?\",\n    \"In the cases when there is only 1 element left in the array, how can you simplify the condition/algorithm?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The requirement to clear the array means all elements must be removed, which mandates that we consider all possible combinations of left, right, and combined removals to achieve the minimal cost. The algorithm should ensure the array is completely empty at the end.\",\n    \"The condition K <= N/2 limits the number of combined removals. If K were greater than N/2, we could only perform N/2 combined removals, since each combined removal takes away 2 elements. The algorithm should not perform more than min(K, N//2) combined removals.\",\n    \"We should try all possible values of combined removals from 0 to K. For each such number, we find the cost of removing the rest of the elements from the left and right of the array individually. We can choose the minimum cost.\",\n    \"If only one element remains, the leftmost and rightmost elements are the same. So, we perform only one removal which will cost that element's value.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
