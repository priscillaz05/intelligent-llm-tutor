N will always be a positive integer. We assume zero is not a prime.\\n- Time Complexity Analysis: Each digit is checked once so number of steps would depend on the number of digits in N.

Since it can only be a single-digit, checking against a predefined set is sufficient.\",\n    \"The single-digit prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\",\n    \"You can initialize a sum variable to 0, then add each identified prime digit to this variable as you extract and check each digit of N.\",\n    \"If N is zero, the loop won't execute, and the sum will be 0. It doesn't require specific handling as the provided approach will return 0 in such scenario, as there will be no prime digits. This aligns with the intended behavior given the problem definition\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
