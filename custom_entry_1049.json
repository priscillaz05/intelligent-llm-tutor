When you finished with the last bit of `n`, start again with the first bit.\\n\\nYou should skip the checking of bits when a non-alphabetic character is encountered, but they should be preserved in their original positions.\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\n```\\nswap('Hello world!', 11)  -->  'heLLO wORLd!'\\n```\\n...because `11` is `1011` in binary, so the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th and 9th alphabetical characters have to be swapped:\\n```\\nH e l l o  w o r l d !\\n1 0 1 1 1  0 1 1 1 0\\n^   ^ ^ ^    ^ ^ ^\\n```\\n\\nMore examples:\\n```\\nswap(\\\"gOOd MOrniNg\\\", 7864)  -->  \\\"GooD MorNIng\\\"\\nswap('', 11345)  -->  ''\\nswap('the lord of the rings', 0)  -->  'the lord of the rings'\\n```\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"from itertools import cycle\\n\\ndef swap(s, n):\\n\\tb = cycle(bin(n)[2:])\\n\\treturn ''.join((c.swapcase() if c.isalpha() and next(b) == '1' else c for c in s))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding Problem Requirements: Recognize that the string's alphabetic characters need to be conditionally case-swapped based on the bits of the given integer `n`. Understand that non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.\\n- Devising a Strategy: Convert the integer `n` to its binary representation and iterate through it. Use `itertools.cycle` to infinitely cycle over the binary string. Iterate through the input string `s`, checking if a character is alphabetic. If it is, use a bit from the cycled binary representation to determine whether to swap the case of that character or not. If a character is non-alphabetic, append it to the resulting string as is, skipping the bit check.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Handle empty strings and zero values of `n` correctly. Ensure the correct binary representation is used and cycled appropriately. Use `swapcase()` method to change the casing of alphabet characters.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you convert the integer `n` into a sequence of bits that can be reused?\",\n    \"How do you handle cases where the string `s` contains non-alphabetic characters?\",\n    \"What strategy can be used if the binary representation is shorter than the number of alphabetic characters in `s`?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently iterate through the string and the bits of `n` simultaneously?\",\n    \"What are the possible edge cases (e.g., empty strings or `n` equals zero) and how should they be handled?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Convert the integer `n` to its binary representation using the `bin()` function and remove the '0b' prefix using slicing `[2:]`. Use `itertools.cycle` to create an iterator that infinitely loops over the bits.\",\n    \"For non-alphabetic characters, they should be added directly to the result string without any case conversion or bit checking.\",\n    \"Use `itertools.cycle` to cycle over the binary string.
