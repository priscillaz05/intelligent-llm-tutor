Unless that is, they wish to crash multimillion dollars worth of equipment on Mars.\\n\\nYour task is to write a simple function that takes a number of meters, and outputs it using metric prefixes.\\n\\nIn practice, meters are only measured in \\\"mm\\\" (thousandths of a meter), \\\"cm\\\" (hundredths of a meter), \\\"m\\\" (meters) and \\\"km\\\" (kilometers, or clicks for the US military).\\n\\nFor this exercise we just want units bigger than a meter, from meters up to yottameters, excluding decameters and hectometers.\\n\\nAll values passed in will be positive integers.\\ne.g.\\n\\n```python\\nmeters(5);\\n// returns \\\"5m\\\"\\n\\nmeters(51500);\\n// returns \\\"51.5km\\\"\\n\\nmeters(5000000);\\n// returns \\\"5Mm\\\"\\n```\\n\\nSee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_prefix for a full list of prefixes\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def meters(x):\\n\\tarr = ['', 'k', 'M', 'G', 'T', 'P', 'E', 'Z', 'Y']\\n\\tcount = 0\\n\\twhile x >= 1000:\\n\\t\\tx /= 1000.0\\n\\t\\tcount += 1\\n\\tif int(x) == x:\\n\\t\\tx = int(x)\\n\\treturn str(x) + arr[count] + 'm'\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires converting a given number of meters into a string representation that utilizes metric prefixes (k, M, G, T, P, E, Z, Y) when the meter value is large enough. The prefixes should only be applied for powers of 1000.\\n- Identifying Appropriate Prefixes: Based on the size of the input value, determine the appropriate metric prefix to use (kilo, mega, giga, tera, peta, exa, zetta, yotta).\\n- Handling Integer vs. Float Conversion: If after dividing by 1000 multiple times the final number is an integer it should be represented as an integer, otherwise it is represented as a float.\\n- Constructing the output string: Return the converted numerical value appended with its prefix and the string \\\"m\\\".\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you determine which metric prefix to use given an input in meters?\",\n    \"How will you handle the case where the converted meter value is a floating-point number vs an integer?\",\n    \"How do you iterate through the metric prefixes based on the value in meters?\",\n    \"How do you construct the final output string to return the converted value and the metric prefix?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Determine how many times the meter value can be divided by 1000 until it becomes less than 1000. The number of divisions corresponds to the index of the prefix in a predefined array of prefixes.\",\n    \"Check if the converted value is an integer. If it is, convert it to an integer; otherwise, leave it as a floating-point number. Then, convert the value to a string for concatenation with the prefix and 'm'.\",\n    \"Use a while loop to divide the number of meters by 1000 until it is less than 1000.
