This involves selecting elements from the array and XORing them together to find the maximum possible result.\\n- Identifying Potential Strategies: To achieve the maximum XOR sum efficiently, consider using Gaussian elimination or a similar bitwise manipulation technique that focuses on maximizing the contribution of higher-order bits.\\n- Algorithmic Details: Iterate through the bits from the most significant bit to the least significant bit. For each bit position, find an element in the array that has that bit set. If found, swap it to the front of the array and then XOR it with all other elements that have that bit set, thus eliminating that bit from those elements. After processing each bit, the elements at the beginning of the array will form a basis that can be XORed to find the maximum XOR sum.\\n- Implementation: Make sure to consider edge cases, such as an empty array.

By selectively XORing elements, you can maximize the result by strategically setting higher-order bits.\",\n    \"We don't need to explicitly explore all subsets.
