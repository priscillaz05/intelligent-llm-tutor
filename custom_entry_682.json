For sake of convenience, we enumerate the ingredients by the integers from 1 to K, both inclusive. There are N islands and each of them offers some ingredients. Chef being a little child did not know how to collect the ingredients for the recipe. He went to all the islands and bought all the ingredients offered in each island. Could he possibly have saved some time by skipping some island? If it was not possible for Chef to collect the required ingredients (i.e. all the K ingredients), output \\\"sad\\\". If it was possible for Chef to skip some islands, output \\\"some\\\", otherwise output \\\"all\\\".\\n\\n-----Input-----\\nFirst line of the input contains an integer T denoting number of test cases. The description of T test cases follow.\\nThe first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N, K.\\nThe i-th of the next lines will contain first an integer Pi, denoting the number of ingredients grown in the i-th island, followed by Pi distinct integers in the range [1, K]. All the integers are space separated. \\n\\n-----Output-----\\nFor each test case, output a single line containing one of the strings \\\"sad\\\", \\\"all\\\" or \\\"some\\\" (without quotes) according to the situation. \\n\\n-----Constraints-----\\n- 1 \u2264 T  \u2264 10\\n- 1 \u2264 N, K \u2264 105\\n- 1 \u2264 Pi \u2264 K\\n- Sum of Pi over all test cases \u2264 106\\n\\n-----Subtasks-----\\nSubtask #1 (30 points)\\n- 1 \u2264 N, K \u2264 50\\n\\nSubtask #2 (30 points)\\n- 1 \u2264 K \u2264 50\\n\\nSubtask #3 (40 points)\\n- original constraints\\n\\n-----Example-----\\nInput\\n3\\n3 4\\n3 1 2 3\\n2 1 3\\n2 1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1 2 3\\n2 1 3\\n2 3\\n2 1 2\\n2 1 3\\n\\nOutput\\nsad\\nsome\\nall\\n\\n-----Explanation-----\\nExample 1. The ingredient 4 is not available in any island, so Chef can't make the dish of life. Hence, the answer is \\\"sad\\\".\\nExample 2. Chef can just go to the first island and collect all the three ingredients required. He does not need to visit the second island. So, the answer is \\\"some\\\".\\nExample 3. Chef has to visit both the islands in order to obtain all the three ingredients. So, the answer is \\\"all\\\".\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"t = int(input())\\nfor i in range(t):\\n\\t(n, k) = [int(j) for j in input().split()]\\n\\tb = set()\\n\\tflag = 0\\n\\tcout = 0\\n\\tfor m in range(n):\\n\\t\\ta = [int(j) for j in input().split()]\\n\\t\\ta1 = a[1:]\\n\\t\\tcout += 1\\n\\t\\tif flag == 1:\\n\\t\\t\\tcontinue\\n\\t\\tb.update(a1)\\n\\t\\tif len(b) == k:\\n\\t\\t\\tflag = 1\\n\\t\\t\\tif cout == n:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprint('all')\\n\\t\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprint('some')\\n\\tif flag == 0:\\n\\t\\tprint('sad')\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires determining whether it's possible to collect all K ingredients from N islands. The output should be \\\"sad\\\" if it's impossible, \\\"some\\\" if some islands can be skipped, and \\\"all\\\" if all islands are needed.\\n- Identifying Edge Cases and Constraints: Consider cases where an ingredient is missing across all islands, or when a single island contains all ingredients. Note the constraints for N and K up to 10^5.\\n- Developing an Algorithm: Iterate through the islands, collecting ingredients into a set. Check after visiting each island if all K ingredients are collected. If all are collected before visiting all islands, output \\\"some\\\". If all islands are visited and all ingredients are collected, output \\\"all\\\". If all islands are visited and not all ingredients are collected, output \\\"sad\\\".\\n- Optimizing for Efficiency: Use a set to efficiently track unique ingredients. A flag variable can be used to avoid redundant iterations after collecting all ingredients.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the possible outputs, and under what conditions should each be printed?\",\n    \"How do you efficiently track the unique ingredients collected so far?\",\n    \"What is the significance of checking whether all K ingredients are collected after visiting each island?\",\n    \"How should the algorithm behave differently if all ingredients are obtained before visiting all islands, versus only after visiting all islands?\",\n    \"What edge cases or initial conditions should be considered before starting the iteration through islands?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The possible outputs are \\\"sad\\\", \\\"some\\\", and \\\"all\\\". \\\"sad\\\" is printed if it's impossible to collect all K ingredients. \\\"some\\\" is printed if all K ingredients are collected before visiting all N islands. \\\"all\\\" is printed if all K ingredients are collected only after visiting all N islands.\",\n    \"A set is the most efficient way to track unique ingredients. It avoids duplicates and provides fast membership checks.\",\n    \"Checking after each island allows determining whether all ingredients are collected before visiting all islands, which is crucial for distinguishing between \\\"some\\\" and \\\"all\\\" outputs.\",\n    \"If all ingredients are obtained before visiting all islands, the output should be \\\"some\\\". If all ingredients are obtained only after visiting all islands, the output should be \\\"all\\\".\",\n    \"An edge case to consider is when an ingredient is missing from all islands. In this case, the output should be \\\"sad\\\". It is also important to ensure N and K are within the allowed constraints.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
