It's crucial to understand the XOR operation's behavior and efficiently compute the required sum, given the constraints on N and A_i.\\n- Identifying Algorithmic Strategy: A naive approach of calculating XOR for each pair will result in O(N^2) time complexity, which may be slow. A more efficient strategy involves analyzing the binary representation of the numbers. For each bit position (0 to 59), count how many numbers have a 1 in that position. The XOR of two numbers has a 1 in the i-th position if only one of them has a 1 in the i-th position. Therefore, the number of pairs that will have a 1 in the i-th position can be found by multiplying the count of numbers with a 1 in the i-th position with the count of numbers with a 0 in that position. Then, each of these pairs contribute 2^i to the final sum.\\n- Implementation Consideration:  Use bitwise operations to efficiently determine the presence of a 1 in each position. Apply the modulo operator to each intermediate calculation to avoid integer overflow and ensure correct results. Pay attention to the modulo operation when calculating and accumulating the final answer.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the XOR operation, and how does it affect the digits in the binary representation of numbers?\",\n    \"Given the constraints, what would be the time complexity of calculating the XOR sum of all possible pairs naively?\",\n    \"How can you optimize the XOR sum calculation by considering each bit position independently?\",\n    \"How can you determine the contribution of each bit position to the final XOR sum?\",\n    \"Why is it important to apply the modulo operator during the calculations, and at what points should it be applied?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The XOR operation results in a 1 in the i-th bit if exactly one of the operands has a 1 in that bit, and 0 otherwise.\",\n    \"The naive approach would have a time complexity of O(N^2), where N is the number of integers.\",\n    \"By iterating through each bit position (0 to 59) and counting the number of integers with a 1 in that position, we can efficiently calculate the number of pairs that will result in a 1 in that bit position.\",\n    \"The contribution of the i-th bit position is 2^i multiplied by the number of pairs where only one of the numbers has a 1 in that position.
