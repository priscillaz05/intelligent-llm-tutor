The lanes have N horizontal barriers lying on it (due to some digging and construction work). The i^{th }barrier cover lanes from Li1 to Li2 (both inclusive). Also, the barriers may overlap. The athletes can\u2019t run on the lanes on which barriers are present because they aren\u2019t allowed to switch lanes anytime in the race. (Once a particular lane is allotted to an athlete he/she can\u2019t switch his/her lane anytime during the race and there can be only one athlete on each lane.)\\nNow the race has to be organised tomorrow itself and the digging work could not be finished on time. The race would have to be organised on the same track only because Fooland city doesn\u2019t have any other track. Help organizers in finding out how many athletes can run in a single race so that none of them would have to switch lanes.\\n \\nExample 1:\\nInput:\\nN = 5, Track = 20\\nL_{i} = {(1 3), (5 8), (8 13), \\n           (14 15), (9 12)}\\nOutput:\\n6\\nExplanation:\\nThe barriers cover lanes from\\n 1 to 3, 5 to 8, 8 to 13, \\n14 to 15 and 9 to 12.

Each barrier covers a range of lanes.\\n- Handling Overlapping Barriers: The problem states that barriers may overlap, meaning a lane can be covered by multiple barriers. This overlap must be accounted for when identifying the lanes without barriers.\\n- Representing Barriers: Barriers are given as pairs (Li1, Li2), representing the start and end lane numbers that the barrier covers.\\n- Developing a Strategy: The overall strategy involves first merging the overlapping barriers to create a concise representation of all the lanes covered by barriers. Once we have the complete set of covered lanes, we can subtract this from the total number of lanes to find the number of lanes that are not covered by any barrier.\\n- Considering Edge Cases: The track starts from lane 1 and ends at lane 'Tracks'. We need to handle cases where there are no barriers or the barriers cover all lanes.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you efficiently manage overlapping barriers and make sure each covered lane is only counted once?\",\n    \"What data structure can effectively keep track of which lanes are covered and which are free?\",\n    \"How can the sorted array of barrier intervals be used to easily compute the available lanes?\",\n    \"What's the most efficient way to determine the number of free lanes given the constraints and desired time complexity?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Overlapping barriers can be efficiently handled by sorting the barriers by their start lane number, and then merging them.  As long as the barriers are sorted, you iterate through them and maintain a current merged range. If the next barrier overlaps with the current range, you expand the current range. Otherwise, the current range is complete, so you add its covered lanes to the set and start a new range with the next barrier.\",\n    \"A boolean array, where each index corresponds to a lane, is effective. Initialize the array to all false (uncovered). Then iterate through each barrier and set the corresponding indices to true (covered). Finally, count the number of false values in the boolean array.\",\n    \"The sorted array can be traversed linearly. Initialize an 'available_lanes' variable to 0. The number of free lanes before the first barrier is the first barrier's start - 1. Then, between each consecutive pair of barriers, the number of free lanes is the difference between the second barrier's start and the first barrier's end, minus 1.\",\n    \"Given the constraint of O(N) time complexity, using an array is most straightforward for marking covered lanes. After marking the covered lanes, iterate through the array once to count the number of unmarked lanes, representing the free lanes.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
