The task is to determine the distances of each cut from the apex.\\n- Mathematical Formulation:  The area of the whole triangle is 0.5 * h * 1 = h/2.  Each of the n pieces should have an area of (h/2) / n = h / (2n). The area of the small triangle formed by the i-th cut from the top is (i+1) * h / (2n). Let x_i be the distance of the i-th cut from the apex.  Then, the base of the small triangle is x_i / h (by similar triangles). The area of the small triangle is 0.5 * x_i * (x_i / h) = x_i^2 / (2h). Equating this to the area of the i-th piece from the top,  x_i^2 / (2h) = (i+1) * h / (2n). Thus x_i = sqrt( (i+1) * h^2 / n) = h * sqrt( (i+1) / n ).\\n- Implementation Details:  The input consists of n and h. Loop from i = 0 to n-2 and calculate x_i.
