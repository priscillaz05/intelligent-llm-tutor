They are moving either in left direction (denoted by '-1') or in the right direction (denoted by '1'). Whenever an ant crosses the boundary of the rod it falls off the rod. You are given the initial direction of the ants. Now, whenever two ants collide their direction switches, i.e. the ant going in left direction ('-1) changes it's direction towards right ('1') and the ant going in the right direction ('1') changes it's direction towards left ('-1'). \\nFind last ant to fall off the rod. \\n\\nNote: In case two ants are falling simultaneously in the end print the index of the lower indexed ant. \\n\\nInput Format:\\n\\nFirst line contains number of test cases and second line contains the integer 'n' denoting the total number of ants s.t. 1 \u2264 n \u2264 1,000\\nSecond line contains 'n' space separated numbers (either '1' or '-1') denoting the initial directions of the ants. \\n\\nOutput Format:\\n\\nOutput a single integer which is the index (lower index in case two ants are falling simultaneously in the end) of the last ant to fall off the table.\\n\\nSAMPLE INPUT\\n2\\n2\\n1 1\\n8\\n1 1 -1 1 1 1 -1 1\\n\\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\\n1\\n3\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"t=int(input())\\nfor p in range(t):\\n\\tn=int(input())\\n\\ta=list(map(int,input().split()))\\n\\tcnt1=0\\n\\tfor i in range(n):\\n\\t\\tif a[i]<0:\\n\\t\\t\\tcnt1+=1\\n\\tif n-cnt1==cnt1:\\n\\t\\tprint(cnt1)\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tif cnt1>n-cnt1:\\n\\t\\t\\tprint(cnt1)\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tprint((cnt1+1))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem describes ants on a rod, each starting at positions 1 to n. The ants move either left or right. When ants collide, they switch directions. The goal is to find the index of the last ant to fall off the rod.  Collisions effectively allow the ants to pass through each other because only the directions are switching.\\n- Simplifying the Problem: Since the ants effectively pass through each other, we can consider the ants as independent entities. Therefore, we only need to count the number of ants going left (cnt1) and right (n-cnt1).\\n- Determine the conditions when the last ant falling off the rod would be cnt1 or cnt1+1: when both the count of ants going left and right are equal then the index of the last ant falling off will be cnt1. when there are more ants on the left as compared to the ants going right, then the last ant falling off the rod would be the index of the cnt1. when there are less ants on the left as compared to the ants going right, then the last ant falling off the rod would be the index of the cnt1 + 1.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does a collision between two ants affect the outcome of which ant falls off the rod last?\",\n    \"If the number of ants going left equals the number of ants going right, which ant falls off last?\",\n    \"If there are more ants going left than right, which ant falls off last?\",\n    \"If there are more ants going right than left, which ant falls off last?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Since the problem states that the ants switch directions upon collision, we can consider the ants as passing through each other and going to their respective ends of the rod as though no collisions happened.\",\n    \"If the number of ants going left equals the number of ants going right (cnt1 == n - cnt1), the ant with index cnt1 falls off last.\",\n    \"If there are more ants going left than right (cnt1 > n - cnt1), the ant with index cnt1 falls off last.\",\n    \"If there are more ants going right than left (cnt1 < n - cnt1), the ant with index cnt1 + 1 falls off last.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
