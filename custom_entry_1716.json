There are three types of copybook's packs in the shop: it is possible to buy one copybook for a rubles, a pack of two copybooks for b rubles, and a pack of three copybooks for c rubles. Alyona already has n copybooks.\\n\\nWhat is the minimum amount of rubles she should pay to buy such number of copybooks k that n + k is divisible by 4? There are infinitely many packs of any type in the shop. Alyona can buy packs of different type in the same purchase.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe only line contains 4 integers n, a, b, c (1 \u2264 n, a, b, c \u2264 10^9).\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nPrint the minimum amount of rubles she should pay to buy such number of copybooks k that n + k is divisible by 4.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n1 1 3 4\\n\\nOutput\\n3\\n\\nInput\\n6 2 1 1\\n\\nOutput\\n1\\n\\nInput\\n4 4 4 4\\n\\nOutput\\n0\\n\\nInput\\n999999999 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000\\n\\nOutput\\n1000000000\\n\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first example Alyona can buy 3 packs of 1 copybook for 3a = 3 rubles in total. After that she will have 4 copybooks which she can split between the subjects equally. \\n\\nIn the second example Alyuna can buy a pack of 2 copybooks for b = 1 ruble. She will have 8 copybooks in total.\\n\\nIn the third example Alyona can split the copybooks she already has between the 4 subject equally, so she doesn't need to buy anything.\\n\\nIn the fourth example Alyona should buy one pack of one copybook.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def copy(n, one, two, three):\\n\\tif n % 4 == 0:\\n\\t\\treturn 0\\n\\tx = 4 - n % 4\\n\\tif x == 1:\\n\\t\\treturn min(one, 3 * three, three + two)\\n\\tif x == 2:\\n\\t\\treturn min(one * 2, two, 2 * three)\\n\\tif x == 3:\\n\\t\\treturn min(three, 3 * one, two + one)\\n(a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().strip().split())\\nprint(copy(a, b, c, d))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires finding the minimum cost to buy additional copybooks such that the total number of copybooks is a multiple of 4. There are three types of packs available, each with a different number of copybooks and cost.\\n- Identify Key Constraints: The number of copybooks, the cost of each pack, and the need to achieve a total that's a multiple of 4 are critical. The costs can be very large.\\n- Formulate Algorithmic Strategy: Determine how many more copybooks are needed to reach the next multiple of 4. Then, consider the different ways to buy that number of copybooks (using packs of 1, 2, or 3) and choose the combination that yields the minimum cost. Precompute values such as the remainder from the division of the current copybooks with 4. Handle the cases depending on the remainder value.\\n- Implementation Details: Calculate the number of additional copybooks needed (0, 1, 2, or 3). For each of these cases, calculate the minimum cost using the available packs. Consider using min function to calculate minimum possible cost.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for the total number of copybooks (initial + bought) to be divisible by 4, and why is that important for the problem?\",\n    \"How do you efficiently determine the number of additional copybooks needed to reach a multiple of 4?\",\n    \"What are the possible combinations of packs to consider when determining the minimum cost, and how do you evaluate them?\",\n    \"What edge cases or special considerations might affect the solution (e.g., when no additional copybooks are needed or when the cost of a single copybook is extremely high)?\",\n    \"Given that the costs a, b, and c can be large, how can you prevent potential integer overflow issues during calculations?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"It means that the total number of copybooks can be equally divided among the 4 subjects Alyona is studying, and the goal is to minimize the cost to achieve this.\",\n    \"You can calculate n % 4 to find the remainder when the current number of copybooks is divided by 4. Then, calculate 4 - (n % 4) to find the number of additional copybooks needed. If n % 4 is 0, then no additional copybooks are needed.\",\n    \"When 1 additional copybook is needed: buy one pack of 1. When 2 additional copybooks are needed: buy two packs of 1 or buy one pack of 2. When 3 additional copybooks are needed: buy three packs of 1, one pack of 1 and one pack of 2, or one pack of 3. You need to consider all possibilities and take the min.\",\n    \"If the initial number of copybooks is already a multiple of 4 (n % 4 == 0), then the minimum cost is 0. Also, if the cost of a single copybook or any pack is significantly high compared to others, it can skew the results.\",\n    \"Given the constraints (costs up to 10^9), calculations like multiplying the number of packs by the cost might result in values exceeding 32-bit integers. Use 64-bit integers if your programming language has such requirement.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
