This can be achieved by removing the last bit if it's a '0'.\\n- Simulating Adding 1: Adding 1 is more complex and requires handling carries.  Start from the least significant bit; if it's a '0', change it to '1' and stop. If it's a '1', change it to '0' and continue to the next bit until a '0' is encountered or all bits are '1's.  If all bits are '1's, a '1' must be prepended to the binary string.\\n- Optimizations and Edge Cases: Handle the edge case where the input is already \\\"1\\\".

If the string ends in 0, just flip the rightmost zero to one and you are done.\",\n    \"The carry propagation can be optimized by stopping once a '0' is encountered, as the carry will not propagate further. In other words, you should iterate from right to left and when you encounter the rightmost '0' turn it to '1', and then stop. However, if there is no zero, it means all the characters from the right are '1' and you should prepend '1' and change them all to zero.\",\n    \"Starting from the least significant bit is essential because it allows for the correct simulation of binary addition, where the carry propagates from right to left. Starting from the most significant bit would lead to incorrect results.\",\n    \"If the input were an integer, one could directly use the modulo operator (%) and division (/) by 2 to simulate the operations.  If the number is even, divide by 2; otherwise, add 1 and count the step. Repeat until the number becomes 1.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
