Any subset that forms a vector space under XOR is a perfect set. The set must be closed under the XOR operation.\\n- Considering the Constraint K: Since all elements in S must be less than or equal to k, this bounds the possible vector spaces. We need to consider all possible vector spaces spanned by elements less than or equal to k.\\n- Dynamic Programming Approach: Since the problem involves counting and constraints, dynamic programming would be a potential solution to explore to avoid recomputation. Given the constraints on element size (k), breaking down k into its binary representation seems relevant, especially combined with XOR operations, which operate bitwise.\\n- Identifying Edge Cases:  The empty set is not considered, so the set must be non-empty. The set {0} is a valid perfect set.\\n- Modulo Arithmetic: Remember to perform modulo operation after each step to avoid integer overflow.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does the term 'perfect set' signify in the context of this problem, and what are its key properties?\",\n    \"What impact does the constraint 'integers not greater than k' have on the possible perfect sets?\",\n    \"Given the bitwise nature of the XOR operation, how might breaking down the integer k into its binary representation aid in solving this problem?\",\n    \"Why is dynamic programming a suitable approach for counting perfect sets under these conditions?\",\n    \"What are some key edge cases or initial conditions to consider when calculating the number of perfect sets, and how do they influence the solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A 'perfect set' is a non-empty set S of non-negative integers such that for any a, b in S, (a xor b) is also in S.
