In the fourth line is space-separated values of the second linked list.\\nOutput:\\nFor each test case output will be an integer denoting the product of the two linked lists.\\nYour Task:\\nThe task is to complete the function multiplyTwoLists() which should multiply the given two linked lists and return the result.\\nConstraints:\\n1 <= T <= 100\\n1 <= N, M <= 100\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7\\n\\ndef multiplyTwoList(head1, head2):\\n\\tno_1 = ''\\n\\tno_2 = ''\\n\\ti = head1\\n\\twhile i:\\n\\t\\tno_1 += str(i.data)\\n\\t\\ti = i.next\\n\\tj = head2\\n\\twhile j:\\n\\t\\tno_2 += str(j.data)\\n\\t\\tj = j.next\\n\\tans = int(no_1) * int(no_2)\\n\\tans = str(ans % (10 ** 9 + 7))\\n\\treturn ans\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: Recognize that the task is to multiply two linked lists, treating each list as a single number where the nodes are digits. Note the modulo operation required to prevent integer overflow.\\n- Data Conversion: Determine how to convert each linked list into a numerical value by traversing the list and concatenating the node values as strings, then converting the string to an integer.\\n- Multiplication and Modulo: Implement the multiplication of the two numbers obtained from the linked lists. Apply the modulo operation to keep the result within the specified bounds.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How should the linked lists be traversed to form the numbers they represent?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently handle large numbers to avoid integer overflow?\",\n    \"What is the purpose of using a modulo operator, and when should it be applied?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The linked lists should be traversed from head to tail, concatenating the data of each node to form a string that represents the number.\",\n    \"Large numbers can be handled by using the modulo operator throughout the calculation to keep the intermediate results within manageable bounds.\",\n    \"The modulo operator is used to ensure that the result fits within a specific range, preventing integer overflow.
