Also, an array with all even numbers should return 0.\\n- Choosing Efficient Logic: Because we need to analyze a potentially large number of subarrays, we need an efficient algorithm. Consider computing the number of even and odd prefixes and using that to determine odd subarray counts.\\n- Implementation Details: Initialize counters for even and odd prefixes. Iterate through the array, maintaining the running sum. If the running sum is odd, then add 1 to the odd prefix count; otherwise, add 1 to the even prefix count. The number of subarrays ending at index i with an odd sum will be equal to the number of even prefixes seen so far. And vice versa for even subarrays.\\n- Handling Modulo: Each operation should be modulo 10^9 + 7 to prevent overflow.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the core requirement of the problem, and what constraints must be considered?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently count subarrays with odd sums without explicitly calculating the sum of every possible subarray?\",\n    \"When computing prefix sums, what should you consider in order to determine if a subarray has an odd sum?\",\n    \"How will you incorporate the modulo operation to handle potentially large results?\",\n    \"What are the initial states of any counters or variables needed in the algorithm?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The core requirement is to find the number of subarrays with an odd sum, modulo 10^9 + 7.

This allows you to determine the number of subarrays ending at a particular index that have an odd sum.\",\n    \"If the running prefix sum at an index is odd, it means the number of even prefixes seen so far represents the number of subarrays ending at this index that have an odd sum. If the prefix sum is even, the number of odd prefixes represents the number of odd-sum subarrays.\",\n    \"Each time a calculation is performed (addition, multiplication, etc.) that could potentially result in a large number, apply the modulo operation (i.e., % (10^9 + 7)) to ensure that the result remains within the specified range.\",\n    \"Typically, you would initialize counters for even and odd prefix sums to 0.
