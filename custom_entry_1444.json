"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"Vasya has several phone books, in which he recorded the telephone numbers of his friends. Each of his friends can have one or several phone numbers.\\n\\nVasya decided to organize information about the phone numbers of friends. You will be given n strings \u2014 all entries from Vasya's phone books. Each entry starts with a friend's name. Then follows the number of phone numbers in the current entry, and then the phone numbers themselves. It is possible that several identical phones are recorded in the same record.\\n\\nVasya also believes that if the phone number a is a suffix of the phone number b (that is, the number b ends up with a), and both numbers are written by Vasya as the phone numbers of the same person, then a is recorded without the city code and it should not be taken into account.\\n\\nThe task is to print organized information about the phone numbers of Vasya's friends. It is possible that two different people have the same number. If one person has two numbers x and y, and x is a suffix of y (that is, y ends in x), then you shouldn't print number x. If the number of a friend in the Vasya's phone books is recorded several times in the same format, it is necessary to take it into account exactly once.\\n\\nRead the examples to understand statement and format of the output better.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nFirst line contains the integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 20)\\u00a0\u2014 number of entries in Vasya's phone books. \\n\\nThe following n lines are followed by descriptions of the records in the format described in statement. Names of Vasya's friends are non-empty strings whose length does not exceed 10. They consists only of lowercase English letters. Number of phone numbers in one entry is not less than 1 is not more than 10. The telephone numbers consist of digits only. If you represent a phone number as a string, then its length will be in range from 1 to 10. Phone numbers can contain leading zeros.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nPrint out the ordered information about the phone numbers of Vasya's friends. First output m\\u00a0\u2014 number of friends that are found in Vasya's phone books.\\n\\nThe following m lines must contain entries in the following format \\\"name number_of_phone_numbers phone_numbers\\\". Phone numbers should be separated by a space. Each record must contain all the phone numbers of current friend.\\n\\nEntries can be displayed in arbitrary order, phone numbers for one record can also be printed in arbitrary order.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n2\\nivan 1 00123\\nmasha 1 00123\\n\\nOutput\\n2\\nmasha 1 00123 \\nivan 1 00123 \\n\\nInput\\n3\\nkarl 2 612 12\\npetr 1 12\\nkatya 1 612\\n\\nOutput\\n3\\nkatya 1 612 \\npetr 1 12 \\nkarl 1 612 \\n\\nInput\\n4\\nivan 3 123 123 456\\nivan 2 456 456\\nivan 8 789 3 23 6 56 9 89 2\\ndasha 2 23 789\\n\\nOutput\\n2\\ndasha 2 23 789 \\nivan 4 789 123 2 456\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def check_suffix(s1, s2):\\n\\tl1 = len(s1)\\n\\tl2 = len(s2)\\n\\tif l1 >= l2:\\n\\t\\treturn 0\\n\\tif s2[-l1:] == s1:\\n\\t\\treturn 1\\n\\treturn 0\\n\\ndef no_suffix(ls):\\n\\tls2 = []\\n\\tfor i in range(len(ls)):\\n\\t\\tfor j in range(len(ls)):\\n\\t\\t\\tif i == j:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontinue\\n\\t\\t\\tif check_suffix(ls[i], ls[j]) == 1:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tls2.append(ls[i])\\n\\tfor i in ls2:\\n\\t\\tif i in ls:\\n\\t\\t\\tls.remove(i)\\n\\treturn ls\\nn = int(input())\\nd = {}\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\tls = input().split()\\n\\tif ls[0] not in d:\\n\\t\\td[ls[0]] = set(ls[2:])\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\td[ls[0]] |= set(ls[2:])\\nprint(len(d))\\nfor i in d:\\n\\tprint(i, end=' ')\\n\\tls = no_suffix(list(d[i]))\\n\\tprint(len(ls), end=' ')\\n\\tfor i in ls:\\n\\t\\tprint(i, end=' ')\\n\\tprint()\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires processing phone book entries to organize phone numbers by person, removing phone numbers that are suffixes of other phone numbers for the same person.\\n- Data Structures: Use a dictionary to store the names of people as keys and a set of their phone numbers as values. Using a set avoids duplicate phone numbers.\\n- Eliminating Suffixes: Implement a helper function to check if one phone number is a suffix of another.  Implement another helper function to remove phone numbers which are suffixes of other phone numbers for the same person.\\n- Input Processing: Read the input, parse each line to extract the name and phone numbers, and store the data in the dictionary.\\n- Output Generation: Iterate through the dictionary, remove suffixes, and print the output in the specified format.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How should I store the data to efficiently handle duplicate phone numbers and associate them with the correct person?\",\n    \"How can I efficiently check if one phone number is a suffix of another?\",\n    \"How can I ensure that I only remove suffixes for the same person and not across different people?\",\n    \"What data structure is best for storing phone numbers associated with a person to avoid duplicates and allow efficient removal of suffixes?\",\n    \"How do I format the final output to meet the problem's requirements?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Use a dictionary where the keys are the names of the people, and the values are sets of phone numbers. Sets will automatically handle duplicates.\",\n    \"Implement a helper function that takes two phone numbers as input and checks if the first one is a suffix of the second one by comparing the last characters of the second phone number to the characters of the first, accounting for length.\",\n    \"When removing suffixes, only compare phone numbers associated with the same person.  Process the phone numbers for each person independently.\",\n    \"A set is best. It avoids duplicates and simplifies the suffix removal process because you only need to compare each number with others in the same set.\",\n    \"First, print the number of unique people. Then, for each person, print their name, the number of phone numbers they have after removing suffixes, and the phone numbers themselves, separated by spaces.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
