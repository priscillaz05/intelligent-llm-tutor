The number of knights `n` and their moods (1 for good, 0 for bad) are given. A regular polygon must have at least 3 vertices. We need to check all possible regular polygons to see if one can be formed entirely by good-mood knights.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints: The problem requires finding divisors of n to determine possible regular polygons (e.g., if n=6, we can form a triangle or a hexagon). For each divisor `d` (representing the number of vertices in the polygon), we need to check if we can find a set of knights spaced `n/d` apart who are all in a good mood.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Iterate through divisors `d` of `n` (where d >= 3). For each `d`, check every possible starting position for the polygon. If a starting position leads to a polygon where all knights are in a good mood, the answer is YES. If no such polygon is found, the answer is NO.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: If all knights are in a good mood, then any regular polygon can be formed. Ensure the algorithm handles the case where no divisors are found greater than or equal to 3.\\n- Optimizing for Efficiency: Consider optimizations if the constraints allowed, but given n <= 10^5, a brute-force approach iterating divisors will be sufficient. Pre-calculating divisors might improve readability.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the possible sizes of regular polygons that can be formed, and how are they related to the number of knights?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently determine if a regular polygon of a specific size can be formed entirely by good-mood knights?\",\n    \"How would you handle the case where all knights are in a good mood, and does this affect your approach?\",\n    \"What are the possible divisors of `n` given `n <= 10^5`, and how does that affect the time complexity of your solution?\",\n    \"How would you optimize the solution if the problem statement allowed to check irregular polygons?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The possible sizes of regular polygons that can be formed are the divisors of the number of knights `n`, excluding 1 and 2, as a regular polygon must have at least 3 vertices. For example, if n=6, we can form a triangle (3), square is not possible as 4 is not a divisor, or a hexagon (6).\",\n    \"For each divisor `d` of `n`, check every possible starting position `k` (from 0 to `n/d - 1`). Then, iterate through the knights at indices `k + i * (n/d)` for `i` from 0 to `d-1`. If all these knights are in a good mood (mood = 1), then a regular polygon of size `d` can be formed.\",\n    \"If all knights are in a good mood, the answer is YES immediately, because any divisor of n forms a regular polygon made of all good knights. The code should short circuit and terminate if all knights are in a good mood. However, in general solution, such an edge case is still naturally handled.\",\n    \"The number of divisors of n, given n <= 10^5 is at most 128, so iterating through the divisors doesn't contribute significantly to the time complexity. The main contribution to the time complexity comes from iterating possible starting positions and checking the moods of knights that make a polygon.\",\n    \"The constraints does not allow to form irregular polygons. If the constraint was removed, one would need to come up with another definition on how to check the existence of such polygons, as a starting point.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
