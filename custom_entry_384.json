Then, for each pair of 'G' sequences, check if swapping a silver trophy allows them to be combined into one longer sequence. The potential longest sequence will be either one of the existing sequences' length plus one (if there is at least one 'S' to swap with a 'G'), or the combined length of two sequences plus one (if there's a single 'S' separating them).  The length of longest sequence of 'G's when no swap is performed needs to be considered as well. Consider the total number of 'G's in the input string to avoid exceeding the theoretical maximum.\\n- Edge Cases: Handle edge cases where there are no 'G's, only 'G's, or only one sequence of 'G's.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the maximum possible length of the longest 'G' sequence, considering the total number of 'G's available?\",\n    \"How do you identify and store the continuous sequences of 'G's along with their starting positions and lengths?\",\n    \"How can you determine if swapping a silver trophy will merge two 'G' sequences, and how do you calculate the new length?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases to consider (e.g., no 'G's, all 'G's), and how should they be handled?\",\n    \"How to determine the maximum length of the golden subsegment without performing any swaps?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The maximum length of the 'G' sequence cannot exceed the total number of 'G's in the input string.  This sets an upper limit to possible improvements after the swap.\",\n    \"Iterate through the string, and when a 'G' is encountered, increment a counter until an 'S' is found.

If the entire array is 'G's, then one swap will not make the length of longest subsegment greater than its original length.
