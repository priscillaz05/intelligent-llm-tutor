It is important to iterate through the string, extract these substrings, and count only the unique ones.\\n- Choosing a Data Structure: Using a dictionary (or hash map) to store the substrings as keys can efficiently track the distinct substrings encountered. This allows for quick lookups to check if a substring has already been seen.\\n- Iterating and Extracting Substrings: The algorithm iterates through the string from the beginning to the second-to-last character.  In each iteration, a substring of length 2 is extracted. This substring is formed by concatenating the character at the current index with the character at the next index.\\n- Checking for Distinctness: For each extracted substring, the algorithm checks if it is already present as a key in the dictionary. If the substring is not in the dictionary, it's added as a new key with a value of 1. If the substring is already present, its corresponding value could be incremented, though this isn't strictly necessary for the problem. The important thing is the existence of the key.\\n- Counting Distinct Substrings: After iterating through the entire string, the number of distinct substrings is simply the number of keys in the dictionary.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you handle cases where the string's length is less than 2?\",\n    \"What data structure could be used to efficiently keep track of the distinct substrings encountered?\",\n    \"How do you extract all substrings of length 2 from a given string?\",\n    \"How do you determine if a substring has already been seen before?\",\n    \"If the string contains overlapping substrings, does it affect the counting of distinct substrings?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"If the string's length is less than 2, there can be no substrings of length 2, so the result should be 0.\",\n    \"A dictionary (or hash map) is an efficient way to store distinct substrings as keys, allowing for quick lookups.\",\n    \"Iterate through the string from the beginning up to the second to last character.
