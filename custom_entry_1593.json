So he was asked to make a very important experiment: to melt the chocolate bar with a new laser device. The device consists of a rectangular field of n \u00d7 m cells and a robotic arm. Each cell of the field is a 1 \u00d7 1 square. The robotic arm has two lasers pointed at the field perpendicularly to its surface. At any one time lasers are pointed at the centres of some two cells.\\n\\nSince the lasers are on the robotic hand, their movements are synchronized \u2014 if you move one of the lasers by a vector, another one moves by the same vector.\\n\\nThe following facts about the experiment are known: \\n\\n  * initially the whole field is covered with a chocolate bar of the size n \u00d7 m, both lasers are located above the field and are active; \\n  * the chocolate melts within one cell of the field at which the laser is pointed; \\n  * all moves of the robotic arm should be parallel to the sides of the field, after each move the lasers should be pointed at the centres of some two cells; \\n  * at any one time both lasers should be pointed at the field. Petya doesn't want to become a second Gordon Freeman. \\n\\n\\nYou are given n, m and the cells (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), where the lasers are initially pointed at (xi is a column number, yi is a row number). Rows are numbered from 1 to m from top to bottom and columns are numbered from 1 to n from left to right. You are to find the amount of cells of the field on which the chocolate can't be melted in the given conditions.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line contains one integer number t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10000) \u2014 the number of test sets. Each of the following t lines describes one test set. Each line contains integer numbers n, m, x1, y1, x2, y2, separated by a space (2 \u2264 n, m \u2264 109, 1 \u2264 x1, x2 \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 y1, y2 \u2264 m).

Each laser melts the cell it points to, and they move in parallel. The constraints are that the lasers must always point within the grid.\\n- Identifying the Melted Area: The key is to determine the area that the lasers can cover. The shape of this area is determined by the relative positions of the two lasers (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), as well as the grid dimensions n and m.\\n- Developing a Formula: The total number of cells melted can be calculated by considering the possible movements. The area where both lasers can reach every cell is a rectangle determined by the ranges [x1, x2] and [y1, y2], so its top left and bottom right coords.  The total number of uniquely melted cells will be twice the area of the rectangle formed by n-abs(x1-x2) and m-abs(y1-y2). However the overlapping area needs to be accounted for. If the reach of the lasers would go out of bounds on opposite ends of the grid, that area would not be considered.\\n- Handling Edge Cases and Constraints: The code needs to handle cases where the relative positions of the lasers are such that the potentially melted areas extend beyond the grid boundaries. This will require checking how much the lasers' combined range can cover within the grid's limits.\\n- Final Calculation: Subtract the melted area from the total area (n * m) to find the number of cells that are not melted.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the maximum area each laser can cover individually, considering the grid's dimensions?\",\n    \"How does the synchronized movement of the lasers affect the total area they can melt?\",\n    \"How can we determine the overlap between the areas melted by the two lasers?\",\n    \"How should we account for the constraint that both lasers must always point within the grid's boundaries?\",\n    \"How can we calculate the total number of cells that are not melted based on the melted area and the total grid size?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Each laser can potentially cover an area equivalent to the entire grid if it could freely move to any cell. However, their movements are restricted by their synchronized nature and the grid boundaries.\",\n    \"Because the lasers move in sync, the distance between them remains constant. This limits the total area they can effectively melt. We need to consider the rectangle formed by the movements of the two lasers.\",\n    \"The overlap area is determined by how much the two rectangles formed by the ranges of each laser coincide. Since the lasers are linked, we must consider that the overlapping region can be smaller or non-existent depending on their positions relative to each other and the grid size.\",\n    \"We must ensure that the movements of both lasers stay within the grid. If a laser is close to an edge, its movement in that direction will be limited, thus affecting the reachable area.\",\n    \"Subtract the calculated melted area from the total area (n * m) to find the unmelted area. Consider the edge cases of laser placements that extend the combined ranges outside the bounds of the grid.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
