He knows that Jungly Mathematics contains certain quadratic equations which have imaginary roots. He is not yet introduced to the concept of imaginary roots and is only concerned with the questions having real roots.\\nThe book contains N quadratic equation of the form a[i]x^2 + b[i]x + c[i] = 0 where a[i] != 0 and i represents the index of the question.\\n\\nYou have to make a program which will take N, a, b and c as input and tell him how many questions he can solve out of those N questions (i.e. You have to find how many quadratic equations in the book have real roots).\\n\\nInput\\n\\nInput will contain a number N denoting the number of quadratic equations.\\n\\nN line follow, each one consisting of three space separated integers a[i], b[i] and c[i] representing the quadratic equation a[i]x^2 + b[i]x + c[i] = 0. where [0 \u2264 i < N].\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nPrint a single integer denoting the number of quadratic equations Bosky can solve.\\n\\nConstraints\\n\\n1 \u2264  N \u2264 100  \\n\\n-100 \u2264 a[i] , b[i], c[i] \u2264 100\\n\\nSAMPLE INPUT\\n2\\n1 0 -1\\n1 1 1\\n\\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\\n1\\n\\nExplanation\\n\\nThe book contains only 2 quadratic equations:\\n\\n1: x^2 - 1 = 0 \\n2: x^2 + x +1 = 0   \\n\\n1st equation has two roots x = 1, -1, thus it can be solved by Bosky. \\n2nd equation has complex roots, hence it can't be solved by Bosky.\\n\\nTherefore, Bosky can solve only 1 question from the book.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"n = int(input())\\ncount = 0\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\ts = input().split()\\n\\ta,b,c = int(s[0]),int(s[1]),int(s[2])\\n\\tif b*b-(4*a*c)>=0:\\n\\t\\tcount+=1\\nprint(count)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: Recognize that the problem asks to count the number of quadratic equations (of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0) that have real roots, given N such equations.\\n- Recalling Quadratic Equation Properties: Recall that a quadratic equation has real roots if and only if its discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is non-negative (i.e., >= 0).\\n- Planning the Algorithm: The program needs to iterate through the N equations. For each equation, it should calculate the discriminant and check if it's non-negative. If it is, increment a counter. Finally, print the counter.\\n- Handling Input: The input consists of N followed by N lines of a, b, and c values. The program needs to read these values correctly.\\n- Implementing the Solution: Read N. Initialize a counter to 0. Loop N times, reading a, b, and c in each iteration. Calculate the discriminant, check the condition, increment the counter if met. Finally, print the counter.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What condition must be satisfied for a quadratic equation to have real roots?\",\n    \"How will you handle the input of multiple sets of coefficients a, b, and c for different quadratic equations?\",\n    \"What steps should you take to compute and evaluate the discriminant for each quadratic equation?\",\n    \"How can you keep track of the number of quadratic equations that have real roots?\",\n    \"What output format is required by the problem statement?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A quadratic equation has real roots if its discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is greater than or equal to zero.\",\n    \"I will read the integer N indicating the number of quadratic equations, and then I'll iterate N times, reading the coefficients a, b, and c for each equation in each iteration.\",\n    \"I will calculate the discriminant as b*b - 4*a*c for each set of coefficients a, b, and c.
