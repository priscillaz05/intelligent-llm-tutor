The first sequence contains only the numbers less than 2 from the original sequence. The second sequence contains the indices of numbers greater than 1 in the original sequence.\\n- Choosing the Data Structures: Lists are appropriate for storing both the filtered numbers and their indices.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: Iterate through the input sequence, checking each number. If a number is less than 2, append it to the first list. If a number is greater than 1, append its index to the second list.\\n- Implementation: Use `enumerate` to efficiently access both the index and value of each element in the sequence.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does the function need to return and how should the result be structured?\",\n    \"How should I iterate through the input list to access both the elements and their indices?\",\n    \"What comparison operators should be used to check if a number is less than 2 or greater than 1?\",\n    \"What data structure is suitable for holding the output of the function?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The function needs to return a tuple containing two lists. The first list should have all numbers from the input sequence less than 2. The second list should have indices of numbers greater than 1.\",\n    \"Use a `for` loop in conjunction with the `enumerate` function to iterate through the input list. This way you'll have access to both the index and value of each element.\",\n    \"Use the `<` operator to check if a number is less than 2 (x < 2). Use the `>` operator to check if a number is greater than 1 (x > 1).\",\n    \"Lists are best suited for storing the elements and their corresponding indices before returning them as a tuple.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
