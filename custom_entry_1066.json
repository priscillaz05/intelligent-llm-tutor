For example, the distance between two points with coordinates $(1, 3)$ and $(4, 2)$ is $|1 - 4| + |3 - 2| = 4$. \\n\\nYou are given two points, $A$ and $B$.

If the point $C$ has coordinates $(23, 3)$, then the distance from $A$ to $B$ is $|49 - 0| + |3 - 0| = 52$, the distance from $A$ to $C$ is $|23 - 0| + |3 - 0| = 26$, and the distance from $B$ to $C$ is $|23 - 49| + |3 - 3| = 26$.\\n\\nIn the second test case, the point $B$ has coordinates $(2, 50)$. If the point $C$ has coordinates $(1, 25)$, then the distance from $A$ to $B$ is $|2 - 0| + |50 - 0| = 52$, the distance from $A$ to $C$ is $|1 - 0| + |25 - 0| = 26$, and the distance from $B$ to $C$ is $|1 - 2| + |25 - 50| = 26$.\\n\\nIn the third and the fourth test cases, it can be shown that no point with integer coordinates meets the constraints.\\n\\nIn the fifth test case, the point $B$ has coordinates $(42, 0)$. If the point $C$ has coordinates $(21, 0)$, then the distance from $A$ to $B$ is $|42 - 0| + |0 - 0| = 42$, the distance from $A$ to $C$ is $|21 - 0| + |0 - 0| = 21$, and the distance from $B$ to $C$ is $|21 - 42| + |0 - 0| = 21.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def solution(b_x, b_y):\\n\\tif (b_x + b_y) % 2:\\n\\t\\treturn '-1 -1'\\n\\tdistance = (b_x + b_y) // 2\\n\\tif distance < b_x:\\n\\t\\treturn f'{distance} 0'\\n\\treturn f'{b_x} {distance - b_x}'\\nprint(*(solution(*map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(int(input()))), sep='\\\\n')\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem Constraints: The problem involves finding a point C, with non-negative integer coordinates, such that the Manhattan distance from A to C is equal to the Manhattan distance from B to C, and both are half the Manhattan distance from A to B. Since all distances must be integers, d(A, B) must be even.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: The Manhattan distance constraint may not allow for integer solutions. If the initial Manhattan distance between A and B is odd, no solution exists as the required distances to C would be non-integers. Additionally, understanding the geometric implications can provide insight into how to find feasible solutions.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: If d(A, B) is even, then a solution might exist. We need to find coordinates (x_c, y_c) that satisfy the Manhattan distance conditions. We can check several potential solutions by explicitly computing distances and verifying if the conditions are met.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Carefully implement the Manhattan distance calculations. Ensure correct handling of the case where no solution exists. Optimizing for speed is not a significant concern since the input values are small (x, y <= 50).\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the significance of the Manhattan distance, and how does it affect the potential solutions?\",\n    \"If the sum of x and y coordinates of point B is odd, what does this imply, and why?\",\n    \"If a valid point C exists, how can we determine its coordinates based on the coordinates of point B?\",\n    \"How do we efficiently determine if a valid point C exists, and what conditions must it satisfy?\",\n    \"What considerations must be taken into account while computing the Manhattan distances to ensure the problem's constraints are met?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The Manhattan distance uses the sum of the absolute differences in coordinates, which imposes constraints on potential integer solutions, making it different from Euclidean distance.\",\n    \"If the sum of x and y is odd, the Manhattan distance from A to B is also odd.
