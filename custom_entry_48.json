You need to first push the elements of the array into a stack and then print minimum in the stack at each pop until stack becomes empty.\\nExample 1:\\nInput:\\nN = 5\\nA = {1 2 3 4 5}\\nOutput: \\n1 1 1 1 1\\nExplanation: \\nAfter pushing elements to the stack, \\nthe stack will be \\\"top -> 5, 4, 3, 2, 1\\\". \\nNow, start popping elements from the stack\\npopping 5: min in the stack is 1.popped 5\\npopping 4: min in the stack is 1. popped 4\\npopping 3: min in the stack is 1. popped 3\\npopping 2: min in the stack is 1. popped 2\\npopping 1: min in the stack is 1. popped 1\\nExample 2:\\nInput: \\nN = 7\\nA = {1 6 43 1 2 0 5}\\nOutput: \\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1\\nExplanation: \\nAfter pushing the elements to the stack, \\nthe stack will be 5->0->2->1->43->6->1. \\nNow, poping the elements from the stack:\\npopping 5: min in the stack is 0. popped 5\\npopping 0: min in the stack is 0. popped 0\\npopping 2: min in the stack is 1. popped 2\\npopping 1: min in the stack is 1. popped 1\\npopping 43: min in the stack is 1. \\n            popped 43\\npopping 6: min in the stack is 1. popped 6\\npopping 1: min in the stack is 1. popped 1.\\n \\nYour Task:\\nSince this is a function problem, you don't need to take any input. Just complete the provided functions _push() and _getMinAtPop(). The _push() function takes an array as parameter, you need to push all elements of this array onto a stack and return the stack. The _getMinAtPop() accepts a stack as a parameter which is returned by _push() function and prints minimum in the stack at each pop separated by spaces.\\nExpected Time Complexity: O(N).\\nExpected Auxiliary Space: O(N).\\nConstraints:\\n0 <= A_{i} <= 10^{7}\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def _push(a, n):\\n\\tstack = []\\n\\tfor i in a:\\n\\t\\tstack.append(i)\\n\\treturn stack\\n\\ndef _getMinAtPop(stack):\\n\\tfor i in range(len(stack)):\\n\\t\\tprint(min(stack), end=' ')\\n\\t\\tstack.pop()\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding Problem Constraints: Understand that the goal is to simulate a stack, and for each pop operation, the minimum value currently in the stack needs to be printed.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Realize that popping elements from the stack modifies it, so the minimum needs to be recalculated each time. Consider edge cases such as an empty stack.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Choose to first push all elements onto the stack and then, in the pop function, iterate while popping elements, calculating and printing the minimum element for each pop.\\n- Implementation Considerations:  Ensure that the stack is correctly implemented (LIFO). Be mindful of updating/recalculating the minimum value in the stack after each element is popped.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is a stack, and how does it operate in terms of adding and removing elements?\",\n    \"How should you handle the stack being modified each time an element is popped from it?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently determine the minimum value in the stack each time an element is popped?\",\n    \"What would be the approach to implement the two functions: one for pushing elements onto the stack and another for popping elements and printing the minimum?\",\n    \"What are the potential edge cases or constraints that might impact the design of the solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A stack is a LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) data structure where elements are added (pushed) to the top and removed (popped) from the top.\",\n    \"Each time an element is popped, the remaining stack changes. Therefore, the minimum must be recomputed based on the new stack content after each pop.\",\n    \"The minimum value can be found by iterating through the current stack after each pop and determining the smallest element remaining.\",\n    \"The push function should iterate through the input array and add each element to the top of the stack. The pop function should then iteratively remove elements from the top, calculate the minimum element, print it, and repeat until the stack is empty.\",\n    \"Edge cases include an empty input array or a situation where the stack becomes empty during the pop operations. In these cases, appropriate checks and handling should be implemented to avoid errors.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
