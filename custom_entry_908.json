Understand that C represents the node position where the loop begins (if C > 0). If C = 0, there is no loop.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Account for edge cases like an empty list, a list with no loop, or a list where the loop starts from the head. Note that the constraints indicate that N (the number of nodes) is between 1 and 500, and C is between 0 and N-1.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Consider the Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm (tortoise and hare algorithm) to detect the loop. If a loop is detected, use another traversal to count the nodes within the loop.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Use two pointers (slow and fast) to traverse the list. If the pointers meet, a loop exists. To count the nodes in the loop, start from the meeting point and traverse the loop until you return to the starting point, counting the nodes along the way.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the steps involved in detecting a loop in a linked list, and what condition signifies the presence of a loop?\",\n    \"If a loop is detected, how can you efficiently determine the number of nodes that are part of the loop without using extra space?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases to consider when checking for loops in linked lists, and how do you handle them to avoid errors?\",\n    \"If there is no loop in the linked list, what value should the function return, and how do you ensure this is the case in your implementation?\",\n    \"How do you modify your approach if the linked list is empty, and what should the function return in such a scenario?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Use Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm with two pointers, slow and fast.
