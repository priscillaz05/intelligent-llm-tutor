Using this rule, the young man left home, bought flowers and went to Nastya. \\n\\nOn the way from Denis's house to the girl's house is a road of n lines. This road can't be always crossed in one green light. Foreseeing this, the good mayor decided to place safety islands in some parts of the road. Each safety island is located after a line, as well as at the beginning and at the end of the road. Pedestrians can relax on them, gain strength and wait for a green light.\\n\\nDenis came to the edge of the road exactly at the moment when the green light turned on. The boy knows that the traffic light first lights up g seconds green, and then r seconds red, then again g seconds green and so on.\\n\\nFormally, the road can be represented as a segment [0, n]. Initially, Denis is at point 0. His task is to get to point n in the shortest possible time.\\n\\nHe knows many different integers d_1, d_2, \u2026, d_m, where 0 \u2264 d_i \u2264 n \u2014 are the coordinates of points, in which the safety islands are located. Only at one of these points, the boy can be at a time when the red light is on.\\n\\nUnfortunately, Denis isn't always able to control himself because of the excitement, so some restrictions are imposed:\\n\\n  * He must always move while the green light is on because it's difficult to stand when so beautiful girl is waiting for you. Denis can change his position by \u00b1 1 in 1 second. While doing so, he must always stay inside the segment [0, n]. \\n  * He can change his direction only on the safety islands (because it is safe). This means that if in the previous second the boy changed his position by +1 and he walked on a safety island, then he can change his position by \u00b1 1. Otherwise, he can change his position only by +1. Similarly, if in the previous second he changed his position by -1, on a safety island he can change position by \u00b1 1, and at any other point by -1. \\n  * At the moment when the red light is on, the boy must be on one of the safety islands. He can continue moving in any direction when the green light is on. \\n\\n\\nDenis has crossed the road as soon as his coordinate becomes equal to n.\\n\\nThis task was not so simple, because it's possible that it is impossible to cross the road. Since Denis has all thoughts about his love, he couldn't solve this problem and asked us to help him. Find the minimal possible time for which he can cross the road according to these rules, or find that it is impossible to do.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6, 2 \u2264 m \u2264 min(n + 1, 10^4)) \u2014 road width and the number of safety islands.\\n\\nThe second line contains m distinct integers d_1, d_2, \u2026, d_m (0 \u2264 d_i \u2264 n) \u2014 the points where the safety islands are located. It is guaranteed that there are 0 and n among them.\\n\\nThe third line contains two integers g, r (1 \u2264 g, r \u2264 1000) \u2014 the time that the green light stays on and the time that the red light stays on.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nOutput a single integer \u2014 the minimum time for which Denis can cross the road with obeying all the rules.\\n\\nIf it is impossible to cross the road output -1.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nInput\\n\\n\\n15 5\\n0 3 7 14 15\\n11 11\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n\\n45\\n\\nInput\\n\\n\\n13 4\\n0 3 7 13\\n9 9\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n\\n-1\\n\\nNote\\n\\nIn the first test, the optimal route is: \\n\\n  * for the first green light, go to 7 and return to 3. In this case, we will change the direction of movement at the point 7, which is allowed, since there is a safety island at this point. In the end, we will be at the point of 3, where there is also a safety island. The next 11 seconds we have to wait for the red light. \\n  * for the second green light reaches 14. Wait for the red light again. \\n  * for 1 second go to 15. As a result, Denis is at the end of the road. \\n\\n\\n\\nIn total, 45 seconds are obtained.\\n\\nIn the second test, it is impossible to cross the road according to all the rules.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import collections\\n(n, m) = map(int, input().split())\\narr = list(map(int, input().split()))\\narr = sorted(arr)\\n(g, r) = map(int, input().split())\\nq = collections.deque()\\nq.append((0, 0, 0))\\nchecked = [[-1] * g for _ in range(m)]\\nchecked[0][0] = 0\\nwhile len(q) != 0:\\n\\t(v, t, cnt) = q.popleft()\\n\\tif v != m - 1:\\n\\t\\tcost1 = arr[v + 1] - arr[v]\\n\\t\\tif t + cost1 <= g:\\n\\t\\t\\tif checked[v + 1][(t + cost1) % g] == -1:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif t + cost1 < g:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tq.appendleft((v + 1, t + cost1, cnt))\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tchecked[v + 1][t + cost1] = cnt\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tq.append((v + 1, 0, cnt + 1))\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tchecked[v + 1][0] = cnt + 1\\n\\tif v != 0:\\n\\t\\tcost2 = arr[v] - arr[v - 1]\\n\\t\\tif t + cost2 <= g:\\n\\t\\t\\tif checked[v - 1][(t + cost2) % g] == -1:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif t + cost2 < g:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tq.appendleft((v - 1, t + cost2, cnt))\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tchecked[v - 1][t + cost2] = cnt\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tq.append((v - 1, 0, cnt + 1))\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tchecked[v - 1][0] = cnt + 1\\nans = 10 ** 18\\nfor i in range(m):\\n\\tfor j in range(g):\\n\\t\\tif checked[i][j] == -1:\\n\\t\\t\\tcontinue\\n\\t\\telif j + n - arr[i] <= g:\\n\\t\\t\\tans = min(ans, checked[i][j] * (g + r) + j + n - arr[i])\\nif ans == 10 ** 18:\\n\\tprint(-1)\\nelse:\\n\\tprint(ans)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem describes Denis trying to cross a road with traffic lights, safety islands, and movement restrictions. The goal is to find the minimum time to cross the road from point 0 to point n.\\n- Defining the State Space: The state can be defined by the current safety island Denis is on, the time remaining on the green light, and the number of completed green-red cycles. \\n- Defining the Transitions: Transitions represent moving to adjacent safety islands within the current green light duration. If the green light expires during a move, a full green-red cycle is added to the time. \\n- Applying BFS: Using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach is suitable as it explores the shortest path first. A deque is used for efficient exploration. \\n- Checking Movement Restrictions: The restrictions on changing direction are simplified by the fact that direction changes are allowed only on safety islands. The problem constraints mandate movement during green light, which simplifies state transitions. \\n- Handling Impossible Cases: If the BFS completes without reaching the destination (point n), then the problem is impossible to solve and -1 should be returned. \\n- Optimizations and Data Structures: A 2D array `checked` is used to keep track of visited states (safety island and remaining green light time) to avoid cycles and redundant calculations.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How should I represent the state to keep track of Denis's progress?\",\n    \"How can I ensure Denis only changes direction on the safety islands?\",\n    \"How can I represent the traffic light cycles and determine when a full cycle (green + red) has completed?\",\n    \"What data structure is most suitable for exploring the possible paths in terms of time?\",\n    \"How do I handle the case where it's impossible to cross the road given the constraints?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The state can be represented as a tuple: (current safety island index, time remaining on the green light, number of completed green-red cycles).\",\n    \"Ensure the movement is only between adjacent safety islands. Check the distance between the islands to determine travel time and if it fits within the remaining green light.\",\n    \"Track the current time within a green light.
