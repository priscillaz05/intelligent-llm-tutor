This means you must sell a stock before buying another.\\n- Identifying State Variables: Determine that the state can be represented by the current day and whether you are holding a stock or not (buy/sell state).\\n- Choosing an Algorithmic Strategy: Realize that dynamic programming or recursion with memoization can be used since we are making decisions (buy or sell) at each day and each decision affects the future profit.\\n- Implementing the Solution: Consider how to transition between states based on the decision to buy or sell the stock. Account for the constraints, and consider an optimized approach (Tabulation with space optimization) to reduce space complexity.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you determine the state of the problem at each step?\",\n    \"What are the possible actions at each state?\",\n    \"How can you model the constraint of not having multiple ongoing transactions?\",\n    \"How does the chosen strategy ensure that the maximum profit is achieved?\",\n    \"How can you reduce the space complexity of the dynamic programming approach?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The state can be represented by the current day and whether you are holding a stock (buying state) or not (selling state).\",\n    \"At each state, you can either buy a stock if you don't have one, or sell a stock if you have one, or do nothing.\",\n    \"The constraint can be modeled by switching between the buying and selling states, so you can only buy if you don't have a stock and can only sell if you have a stock.\",\n    \"The chosen strategy ensures that at each step, the maximum profit is chosen between taking an action (buy or sell) or not taking any action, leading to the optimal profit in the end.\",\n    \"The space complexity can be reduced by using tabulation with space optimization. Instead of storing all the states, we can use only two arrays (current and next) to store the required values, as the current profit only depends on the next day's profit.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
