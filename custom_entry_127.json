First, he decided to paint the path from his house to the gate.\\n\\nThe path consists of $n$ consecutive tiles, numbered from $1$ to $n$. Ujan will paint each tile in some color. He will consider the path aesthetic if for any two different tiles with numbers $i$ and $j$, such that $|j - i|$ is a divisor of $n$ greater than $1$, they have the same color. Formally, the colors of two tiles with numbers $i$ and $j$ should be the same if $|i-j| > 1$ and $n \\\\bmod |i-j| = 0$ (where $x \\\\bmod y$ is the remainder when dividing $x$ by $y$).\\n\\nUjan wants to brighten up space.

This constraint ties certain tiles together such that they must have the same color.\\n- Devising a Strategy: The key insight is to recognize that if $n$ is prime, then no such divisor exists, so all tiles can have different colors. If $n$ is composite, we need to determine how many groups of tiles must have the same color. The answer will depend on the prime factorization of $n$. If $n$ has more than one prime factor, then the answer is 1. If n is a power of a prime, then the answer is that prime.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: The case where $n = 1$ is a special case. The problem states $1 <= n <= 10^{12}$, so the largest possible value of $n$ requires us to consider factors up to $\\\\sqrt{n}$.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What condition determines whether two tiles must have the same color?\",\n    \"If n is a prime number, what is the maximum number of different colors that can be used?\",\n    \"If n is a composite number, how does the number of different colors relate to the factors of n?\",\n    \"What is the significance of considering the prime factorization of n in this problem?\",\n    \"How can we handle the specific case when n is equal to 1?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Two tiles $i$ and $j$ must have the same color if $|i - j| > 1$ and $n \\\\bmod |i - j| = 0$, meaning $|i-j|$ is a divisor of $n$ greater than 1.\",\n    \"If n is a prime number, then no two tiles are constrained to have the same color. Therefore, the maximum number of different colors that can be used is n.\",\n    \"If n is composite, certain tiles must have the same color, reducing the maximum number of different colors that can be used. If n has more than one prime factor, the answer is 1. If n is a power of a prime p, the answer is p.\",\n    \"The prime factorization of n helps us determine if there are divisors greater than 1 that satisfy the given condition. If n has only one prime factor (i.e., n is a power of a prime), we can relate that prime to the number of colors.
