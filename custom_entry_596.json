"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"Nantendo Co., Ltd. has released a game software called Packet Monster. This game was intended to catch, raise, and fight monsters, and was a very popular game all over the world.\\n\\nThis game had features not found in traditional games. There are two versions of this game, Red and Green, and the monsters that can be caught in each game are different. The monsters that can only be caught by Red are Green. To get it at, use a system called communication exchange. In other words, you can exchange monsters in your software with monsters in your friend's software. This system greatly contributed to the popularity of Packet Monster. ..\\n\\nHowever, the manufacturing process for the package for this game was a bit complicated due to the two versions. The factory that manufactures the package has two production lines, one for Red and the other for Red. Green is manufactured in. The packages manufactured in each line are assigned a unique serial number in the factory and collected in one place. Then, they are mixed and shipped by the following stirring device. It is.\\n\\n<image>\\n\\nThe Red package is delivered from the top and the Green package is delivered to this stirrer by a conveyor belt from the left side. The stirrer is made up of two cross-shaped belt conveyors, called \\\"push_down\\\" and \\\"push_right\\\". Accepts two commands. \\\"Push_down\\\" says \\\"Move the conveyor belt running up and down by one package downward\\\", \\\"push_right\\\" says \\\"Move the conveyor belt running left and right by one package to the right\\\" The agitation is done by executing the same number of push_down instructions as the Red package and the push_right instruction, which is one more than the number of Green packages, in a random order. The last instruction to be executed is determined to be \\\"push_right\\\". Under this constraint, the number of Red packages and the number of packages reaching the bottom of the stirrer match, the number of Green packages and the right edge of the stirrer. The number of packages that arrive at matches.\\n\\nThe agitated package finally reaches the bottom or right edge of the conveyor belt, and is packaged and shipped in the order in which it arrives.\\n\\nAn example of a series of stirring procedures is shown below. For simplicity, one package is represented as a one-letter alphabet.\\n\\n<image>\\n\\nBy the way, this factory records the packages that arrived at the lower and right ends of the belt conveyor and their order for the purpose of tracking defective products. However, because this record is costly, the factory manager reached the lower end. I thought about keeping records only for the packages. I thought that the packages that arrived at the right end might be obtained from the records of the packages that were sent to the top and left ends and the packages that arrived at the bottom.\\n\\nPlease help the factory manager to create a program that creates a record of the package that arrives at the far right.\\n\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe input consists of multiple datasets. The end of the input is indicated by a- (hyphen) line.\\n\\nOne input consists of a three-line alphabetic string containing only uppercase and lowercase letters. These represent the Red package, the Green package, and the package that reaches the bottom, respectively. Represent.

Red packages come from the top, and Green from the left. The stirrer uses 'push_down' and 'push_right' commands. The goal is to determine the order of packages arriving at the right edge, given the order of Red, Green and bottom packages.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints:  The number of 'push_down' operations equals the number of Red packages, and 'push_right' is one more than the Green packages. The last instruction is 'push_right'.  No duplicate characters in Red or Green. No common characters between Red and Green.\\n- Devising an Algorithm: Simulate the stirring process. Use the bottom package sequence to determine whether a Red or Green package exits at the bottom. If the current bottom package matches the current Green package, then a Red package must have exited at the bottom and it's the next Red package. Otherwise, the current Green package exited at the right. Keep track of the right edge packages as we process.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do the 'push_down' and 'push_right' operations affect the order of packages arriving at the bottom and right edges?\",\n    \"How can the bottom package sequence be used to infer the sequence of right edge packages?\",\n    \"What data structures are suitable for keeping track of the Red, Green, and bottom packages and their current positions?\",\n    \"How to handle the constraint of the last operation being 'push_right'?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases, such as when one of the input lists is empty, and how should they be handled?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The 'push_down' operation results in a Red package exiting at the bottom, while 'push_right' causes a Green package to exit at the right edge.\",\n    \"By comparing the current package in the bottom sequence with the head of the Green package sequence, we can determine whether a Red package (matching Green) or a Green package (not matching Green) exited.\",\n    \"Lists are suitable. Red, Green, and Bottom packages can be stored as lists, and elements are removed from the front as the packages exit.\",\n    \"The last package to exit must be from the Green packages, as 'push_right' is the last operation. This can be used to make the final deduction if some packages remain.\",\n    \"If the Red or Green package list is empty before the bottom list is fully processed, it implies a problem in the input, as all operations are determined by Red and Green quantities. If either list runs out, handle it appropriately during the simulation.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
