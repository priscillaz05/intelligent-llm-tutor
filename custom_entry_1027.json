The answer must be calculated modulo $163,577,857$.\\n- Identifying Key Components: Recognize that the array consists of -1s, 0s, and 1s. Understand that the number of subsequences with sum $x$ depends on the counts of -1s, 0s, and 1s in the array.\\n- Formulating a Strategy: Decide to use combinations to count the number of subsequences summing to a certain value. Realize the importance of accounting for the number of zeros since they can be included or excluded from any subsequence without affecting its sum. Consider using the binomial coefficient to calculate combinations efficiently.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Specifically, address the case when the sum is 0. The empty subsequence needs to be excluded, and therefore 1 needs to be subtracted from $C_{N}$\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does the presence of zeros in the array affect the calculation of subsequences with a specific sum?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently calculate the binomial coefficient $nCr$ modulo a prime number?\",\n    \"How do you account for the non-empty constraint when calculating the number of subsequences?\",\n    \"How can you use the counts of -1s, 0s and 1s to calculate the number of subsequences with a target sum?\",\n    \"What is the purpose of using modulo operation throughout the calculation, and why is it important in this problem?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Each zero can either be included or excluded from a subsequence without changing its sum. If there are $z$ zeros, then for any sum formed by other elements, there are $2^z$ subsequences that have that sum.\",\n    \"You can precompute factorials and their inverses modulo the prime. Then, $nCr = n! * (r!)^{-1} * ((n-r)!)^{-1}  (mod  p)$. Use Fermat's Little Theorem to find the modular inverse.\",\n    \"Since the problem asks for non-empty subsequences, if $x = 0$, we need to subtract the case where we pick nothing i.e. the empty subsequence from the count of subsequences that sum up to zero.\",\n    \"Count the number of 1s and -1s. Let's say we want a sum $k$. Then we need to pick $ones - k$ number of -1s. Then use binomial coefficient to choose the number of ways to do this.
