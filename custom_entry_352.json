The coach is worried that they will not be able to qualify because they don't have a famous footballer in their team. The assistant coach suggests that the team should buy Cristiano Ronaldo as he can single-handedly get their team qualified.  \\n\\nOn day 1, today, the club has to pay 'A' HackerCoins in order to buy Ronaldo. After each passing day, the price of buying Ronaldo becomes A times the price on the previous day. Any normal person would buy him on the 1^{st} day itself as the price will be the lowest but since the coach always failed in high school Mathematics, he wants 'B' days to think before making him an offer.  \\n\\nAs the coach doesn't know how to calculate the price of Ronaldo on the B^{th} day, he has asked for your help.  \\n\\nYour task is to tell the price of Ronaldo on the B^{th} day. Since, the price can be a very large number, please tell him the price modulo 10^{9} + 7.\\n\\nInput Format \\n\\nThe first line contains an integer T, the number of testcases.

We need to use the pow() function which can handle the modulo operation directly during the exponentiation and is much more efficient than calculating the large power first and then applying the modulo operation.\\n- Selecting the Algorithm: We can use the pow(A, B, mod) function which efficiently calculates (A^B) % mod. This avoids calculating a large intermediate result.\\n- Implementation Details: Need to convert the string inputs A and B into integers. Read A and B from standard input.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Why can't we simply compute A^B and then take the modulo?\",\n    \"How does the pow(A, B, mod) function optimize the calculation?\",\n    \"What are the potential issues when reading very large numbers as strings?\",\n    \"What is the purpose of taking the modulo 10^9 + 7?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Directly computing A^B with such large A and B would result in an extremely large number that could exceed the maximum representable value for standard numeric types, leading to overflow errors.\",\n    \"The pow(A, B, mod) function uses the properties of modular arithmetic to compute the power incrementally while applying the modulo at each step. This prevents the intermediate results from becoming too large and causing overflow.\",\n    \"When reading large numbers as strings, one needs to convert the strings into integers using appropriate conversion methods to perform numerical operations. Memory limitations can also be a problem when attempting to store these numbers if not handled properly.\",\n    \"Taking the modulo 10^9 + 7 ensures that the result remains within a manageable range, preventing integer overflow while preserving the correctness of the answer based on modular arithmetic properties.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
