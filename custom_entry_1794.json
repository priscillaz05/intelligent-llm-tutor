Note that some packets might be unavailable (cost = -1). Realize that you can use multiple packets of the same weight if available.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Consider the case where it's impossible to reach exactly W kgs. Handling invalid cost values (-1) is important. Optimization is needed to find the minimum cost, suggesting the use of dynamic programming or similar techniques.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Decide on a dynamic programming approach to store the minimum cost to obtain specific weights. Specifically, top-down DP (memoization) or bottom-up DP can be applied.\\n- Implementing the Solution: Establish a DP table to store the minimum cost to reach each weight from 0 to W. Iterate through available weights and update the DP table by considering whether or not to include each available packet. Return -1 if W kgs cannot be obtained.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does cost[i] represent, and how does a value of -1 affect your decision-making in selecting packets?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases or constraints you should handle to return -1 correctly when it's not possible to buy W kgs of oranges?\",\n    \"Why is dynamic programming suitable for this problem, and how would you structure the DP table?\",\n    \"How would you handle the availability of multiple packets of the same weight in your dynamic programming approach?\",\n    \"When implementing the dynamic programming algorithm, what would be the base cases, and how would you transition between states?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"cost[i] represents the cost of an (i+1) kg packet of oranges. If cost[i] is -1, it means the (i+1) kg packet is not available and should not be considered when trying to reach the target weight W.\",\n    \"I should handle cases where W is 0 (return 0 if the cost is valid, -1 if not). Also, if after considering all possible combinations of packets, the minimum cost to reach W is still infinity (or some large value indicating unreachable), it means we cannot buy exactly W kgs of oranges, so return -1.\",\n    \"Dynamic programming is suitable because it allows us to break down the problem into smaller subproblems (minimum cost to reach smaller weights) and reuse these solutions to find the minimum cost to reach W. I'd use a DP table where dp[i] stores the minimum cost to reach a weight of i kgs.\",\n    \"Since we can use multiple packets of the same weight, for each available packet of weight i+1, I can repeatedly consider including it in the solution. This means I will iterate through the DP table and update the cost to reach weight j by considering including a packet of weight i+1, provided j >= i+1.\",\n    \"The base case is dp[0] = 0 (cost to reach 0 kg is 0). The transition would be: for each available packet of weight i+1 with cost cost[i], dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j - (i+1)] + cost[i]) for all j >= i+1. I'd initialize the DP table with a very large value (e.g., infinity) to denote that a particular weight is initially unreachable.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
