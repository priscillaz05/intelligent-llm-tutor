The task is to calculate the total number of water bottles and towels needed for the entire tournament.\\n- Variables: n is the number of participants, b is the number of water bottles per participant per match, and p is the number of towels per participant for the entire tournament.\\n- Tournament Rounds: In each round, the largest power of 2 (k) that is less than or equal to the current number of participants (m) is determined. Then k participants play matches, with k/2 winners advancing. The remaining m-k participants also advance to the next round.\\n- Bottleneck calculation: For each match, 2 participants require 'b' bottles each and 1 bottle for the judge (2*b + 1 bottles per match). Towels can be calculated as n*p.\\n- Looping and Calculations: The number of matches in a round is k/2. So, total bottles needed for a round will be (2 * b + 1) * (k / 2).  Towels required is simply n * p (number of participants * towels per participant).\\n- Termination: The tournament continues until only one participant remains. The cumulative sum of the bottles used in each round is the answer.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Could you explain the tournament elimination structure and how the number of participants changes in each round?\",\n    \"How are the water bottles consumed in each match, and how does this affect the total calculation for each round?\",\n    \"How do you determine the value of 'k' in each round, and why is it important?\",\n    \"Can you explain the calculation of towels needed for the entire tournament?\",\n    \"How does the loop termination condition work, and when does the tournament end?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"In each round, the largest power of 2 (k) less than or equal to the number of participants (m) is used to determine how many matches occur. Half of k participants win and advance, and the remaining m-k participants also advance directly to the next round.\",\n    \"Each match has two participants, and each participant needs 'b' bottles of water. Additionally, one bottle is needed for the judge. Thus, (2*b + 1) bottles are needed per match. This affects the total calculation by multiplying the number of matches in a round by (2*b + 1).\",\n    \"'k' is the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the current number of participants. It is important because k/2 matches are played in a round, and this determines the water bottle consumption and the reduction in the number of participants.\",\n    \"The total number of towels needed for the entire tournament is the number of participants (n) multiplied by the number of towels per participant (p).\",\n    \"The tournament ends when only one participant remains.
