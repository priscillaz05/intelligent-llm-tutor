Understand that RPN means operators follow their operands.\\n- Data Structures: Identify that a stack is appropriate for managing operands.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: Use a loop to process the tokens. If the token is an operand, push it onto the stack. If it is an operator, pop the top two elements from the stack, apply the operator, and push the result back onto the stack.\\n- Special Conditions: Recognize the need to handle integer division truncation.\\n- Termination: After processing all tokens, the stack should contain a single element which is the final result.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the characteristics of Reverse Polish Notation, and how does it affect the order of operations?\",\n    \"Which data structure is best suited for evaluating RPN expressions, and why?\",\n    \"How do you manage the operands and operators while processing the tokens?\",\n    \"How do you handle integer division truncation in Python?\",\n    \"What should the state of the stack be after all tokens are processed, and what does this signify?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"In RPN, the operators follow their operands. This eliminates the need for parentheses. We process from left to right, applying operators to the operands immediately preceding them.\",\n    \"A stack is the ideal data structure. Operands can be pushed onto the stack, and when an operator is encountered, the necessary operands can be popped from the stack.\",\n    \"When a token is an operand (number), it is pushed onto the stack.
