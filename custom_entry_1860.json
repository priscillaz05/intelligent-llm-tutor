We are allowed to use a number from `A` multiple times in a combination. Combinations must be in non-descending order and the set of combinations should be sorted in ascending order.\\n- Handling Duplicates and Sorting: Remove duplicates from the input array `A` to avoid redundant computations and ensure uniqueness of combinations. Sort the array in non-descending order, which is a prerequisite for creating combinations in non-descending order.\\n- Choosing Algorithmic Approach: A backtracking approach is appropriate for exploring all possible combinations. A recursive function can be used to explore the possible choices at each step. This will generate the required combinations and maintain the specified orders.\\n- Implementing Recursive Logic: The recursive function should explore two possibilities at each index:\\n   1. Include the current number in the combination and proceed to the next recursive call with a reduced target sum. The index remains the same to allow the same number to be chosen again.\\n   2. Exclude the current number from the combination and proceed to the next recursive call with the same target sum, but the index is incremented to consider the next number.\\n- Base Case: The base case for the recursion is when the target sum becomes zero. When this happens, the current combination `ds` (which is a list) is added to the list of valid solutions. If index is greater than or equal to the length of array, terminate the recursion and check for valid combination\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What constraints do we need to consider when creating the combinations?\",\n    \"How would you remove duplicates from the input array, and why is it important?\",\n    \"What kind of algorithmic approach is suitable for finding all possible combinations, and why?\",\n    \"How would you design a recursive function to explore the possible choices and maintain the specified order?\",\n    \"What base case should be used to terminate the recursion and check for valid combinations?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The numbers within a combination should be in non-descending order, and the combinations themselves should be sorted in ascending order. We are also allowed to use the same number multiple times in a combination.\",\n    \"We can use the `set` data structure to remove duplicates from the input array. This ensures that the same combination is not generated multiple times, which is a requirement for this problem.\",\n    \"A backtracking algorithm using recursion is suitable for finding all possible combinations. It allows us to explore all possible choices at each step and generate the desired combinations in a systematic manner.\",\n    \"The recursive function should explore two possibilities at each index: include the current number in the combination (if it is less than or equal to the target) and exclude it. The index should be incremented to consider the next number when excluding, but stay the same when including the number again for multiple occurrences.\",\n    \"The base case for the recursion is when the target sum becomes zero. When this happens, the current combination is a valid solution and should be added to the list of solutions. Another base case will be when the index becomes greater than or equal to the length of array, and here it should terminate and return without making any change if sum B is not 0.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
