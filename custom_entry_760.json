Also, we understand the initial assignment of values to each face.\\n- Representing the Dice: Think about how to represent the dice in a program. A dictionary seems appropriate to hold the face values.\\n- Simulating Rolls: Plan how to simulate rolling the dice. A series of rotations changes the orientation and thus the visible faces.\\n- Search Algorithm: Devise a strategy to find the correct orientation, given the top and front face. Brute force by trying a defined set of roll sequences until a match is found.\\n- Implementation Details: Take into account the input format and ensure values are properly assigned and that the right face is returned.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you represent the dice with its faces and their corresponding values in code?\",\n    \"How would you simulate rolling the dice in different directions, and what changes occur to the face values during each roll?\",\n    \"Given the top and front face values, how can you determine the value of the right face?\",\n    \"How do you handle the input format, including initial face values and a series of queries?\",\n    \"What are some potential optimizations for the search algorithm to find the correct orientation quickly?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"I would use a dictionary where keys are face names ('up', 'down', 'left', 'right', 'front', 'back') and values are integers representing the number on that face.\",\n    \"I would define functions for each direction (North, South, East, West) that simulate a roll by reassigning face values within the dictionary. Each roll direction corresponds to a specific cyclic permutation of face values.\",\n    \"By simulating rotations of the dice until the top and front face values match the given input, the value of the right face in that orientation is the answer.\",\n    \"The first line is parsed to assign initial values to the dice faces. The second line is the number of queries. For each query, the top and front face values are parsed, and the dice is virtually rotated until a match is found.\",\n    \"The search could be optimized by defining a more efficient sequence of rolls that guarantees finding the correct orientation with fewer steps. Memoization could also be used to store previously found orientations.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
