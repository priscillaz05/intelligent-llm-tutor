Overlapping areas should only be counted once. The result needs to be modulo 10^9 + 7.\\n- Identifying Key Data Structures and Algorithms: An effective approach involves using a line sweep algorithm. The events are the left and right edges of the rectangles. An interval list keeps track of the current active y-intervals at each x-coordinate. A helper function calculates the covered area at each step of the line sweep.\\n- Handling Overlap: The algorithm efficiently handles overlapping rectangles by keeping track of intervals of y-coordinates covered by active rectangles at each x-coordinate. When a new rectangle's left edge is encountered, the corresponding y-interval is added. When a right edge is encountered, the interval is removed.\\n- Considering Modulo: Since the area can be very large, apply the modulo operation (10^9 + 7) at the end to keep the result within the required range.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you efficiently handle overlapping rectangles to avoid double-counting the area?\",\n    \"What data structure is best suited for managing the active y-intervals during the line sweep, and why?\",\n    \"How does the line sweep algorithm work in this context?\",\n    \"Why is it important to sort the events, and what is the sorting criteria?\",\n    \"When should the modulo operation be applied to ensure the result remains within the specified range?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The algorithm uses a line sweep technique, processing rectangles from left to right. By maintaining a list of active y-intervals, overlapping regions are accounted for only once.\",\n    \"A sorted list or a set can be used to keep track of active y-intervals. A sorted list allows easy maintenance and computation of covered intervals at each step.\",\n    \"The line sweep algorithm involves sorting the left and right edges of the rectangles by their x-coordinates. As the sweep line moves, y-intervals are added or removed based on encountering left or right edges, respectively. The covered area at each x-coordinate is calculated and added to the total.\",\n    \"Sorting the events (rectangle edges) ensures that the rectangles are processed in the correct order from left to right, which is crucial for the line sweep algorithm to work correctly. The sorting criteria are based on x-coordinate first and then the event type (left or right edge).\",\n    \"The modulo operation should be applied after calculating the total area to prevent overflow, and it is applied using the expression area % (10^9 + 7).\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
