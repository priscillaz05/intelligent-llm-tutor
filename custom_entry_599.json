In this connection the local library decided to make an exposition of the works of this famous science-fiction writer. It was decided as well that it is necessary to include into the exposition only those books that were published during a particular time period. It is obvious that if the books differ much in size, the visitors will not like it. That was why the organizers came to the opinion, that the difference between the highest and the lowest books in the exposition should be not more than k millimeters.\\n\\nThe library has n volumes of books by Berlbury, arranged in chronological order of their appearance. The height of each book in millimeters is know, it is hi. As Berlbury is highly respected in the city, the organizers want to include into the exposition as many books as possible, and to find out what periods of his creative work they will manage to cover. You are asked to help the organizers cope with this hard task.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line of the input data contains two integer numbers separated by a space n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 105) and k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 106) \u2014 the amount of books by Berlbury in the library, and the maximum allowed height difference between the lowest and the highest books. The second line contains n integer numbers separated by a space. Each number hi (1 \u2264 hi \u2264 106) is the height of the i-th book in millimeters.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nIn the first line of the output data print two numbers a and b (separate them by a space), where a is the maximum amount of books the organizers can include into the exposition, and b \u2014 the amount of the time periods, during which Berlbury published a books, and the height difference between the lowest and the highest among these books is not more than k milllimeters.\\n\\nIn each of the following b lines print two integer numbers separated by a space \u2014 indexes of the first and the last volumes from each of the required time periods of Berlbury's creative work.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nInput\\n\\n3 3\\n14 12 10\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n2 2\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n2 0\\n10 10\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n2 1\\n1 2\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n4 5\\n8 19 10 13\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n2 1\\n3 4\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"from collections import deque\\n\\ndef mini_in_window(A, n, k):\\n\\td = deque()\\n\\tres = []\\n\\tfor i in range(n):\\n\\t\\tif i >= k and d[0] == i - k:\\n\\t\\t\\td.popleft()\\n\\t\\twhile len(d) and A[d[-1]] >= A[i]:\\n\\t\\t\\td.pop()\\n\\t\\td.append(i)\\n\\t\\tif i >= k - 1:\\n\\t\\t\\tres.append(d[0])\\n\\treturn res\\n\\ndef maxi_in_window(A, n, k):\\n\\td = deque()\\n\\tres = []\\n\\tfor i in range(n):\\n\\t\\tif i >= k and d[0] == i - k:\\n\\t\\t\\td.popleft()\\n\\t\\twhile len(d) and A[d[-1]] <= A[i]:\\n\\t\\t\\td.pop()\\n\\t\\td.append(i)\\n\\t\\tif i >= k - 1:\\n\\t\\t\\tres.append(d[0])\\n\\treturn res\\n(n, k) = map(int, input().split())\\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\\nl = 0\\nr = n + 1\\nmaxans = 0\\ncntmax = []\\nwhile l + 1 < r:\\n\\tmid = (l + r) // 2\\n\\tif mid > maxans:\\n\\t\\tcntnow = []\\n\\t\\tmins = mini_in_window(A, n, mid)\\n\\t\\tmaxes = maxi_in_window(A, n, mid)\\n\\t\\tfor i in range(len(mins)):\\n\\t\\t\\tif A[maxes[i]] - A[mins[i]] <= k:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcntnow.append((i + 1, mid + i))\\n\\t\\tif cntnow:\\n\\t\\t\\tl = mid\\n\\t\\t\\tcntmax = cntnow[:]\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tr = mid\\nprint(l, len(cntmax))\\nfor line in cntmax:\\n\\tprint(' '.join(map(str, line)))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding Problem Requirements: The problem requires finding the maximum number of books that can be included in an exposition such that the difference between the highest and lowest book is not more than k. Also, it asks to find how many such time periods exist and their start and end indices.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: The number of books can be quite large (up to 10^5). Thus, brute-force will lead to TLE (Time Limit Exceeded) error. The solution needs to be efficient to handle the constraints.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Binary search can be used to find the maximum number of books. For each mid value (potential number of books), a sliding window approach can check if the height difference within that window is <= k.  Two deques (double-ended queues) can efficiently maintain the minimum and maximum element within the sliding window.\\n- Implementing the Sliding Window: Two helper functions `mini_in_window` and `maxi_in_window` will use deques to store indices of the minimum and maximum elements within the sliding window of size `mid` books. These functions return lists of indices of minimum and maximum elements for each possible sliding window. Then, for each window, check `A[maxes[i]] - A[mins[i]] <= k`. If this is true, then valid number of books `mid` can be present in the exposition.\\n- Post-processing and Output: After finding the maximum possible number of books `l` through binary search, the code also needs to find all the time periods which correspond to the required number of books and height difference <= k, i.e., stored in `cntmax`. Then the result is printed as specified in the output format.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the key constraints that make a straightforward brute-force approach inefficient?\",\n    \"How can a binary search approach be applied to find the maximum number of books?\",\n    \"How can the sliding window technique be used to efficiently check if the height difference constraint is met within each window?\",\n    \"What is the role of the deques in tracking the minimum and maximum values within the sliding window, and how do they improve efficiency?\",\n    \"How does the code identify and store all valid time periods after determining the maximum number of books?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The large number of books (up to 10^5) makes brute-force inefficient due to the high time complexity of checking every possible combination.\",\n    \"Binary search can efficiently find the maximum number of books by testing mid values and narrowing down the search range based on whether the height difference constraint is met.\",\n    \"The sliding window technique allows us to efficiently iterate through all possible windows of a fixed size, checking the height difference constraint without redundant calculations.\",\n    \"The deques store indices of the minimum and maximum elements in a window, allowing for O(1) updates as the window slides, thereby improving efficiency compared to recalculating min and max for each window.\",\n    \"After determining the maximum number of books, the code stores all valid time periods (start and end indices) in the `cntmax` list, based on the windows that meet the height difference constraint.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
