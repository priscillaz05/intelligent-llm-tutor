It's crucial to understand that two substrings are different if their sequences of characters are different.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Directly generating all substrings and checking for uniqueness might lead to inefficient solutions, especially for large strings and multiple queries. The brute force approach's time complexity could be prohibitive. Need to avoid double-counting identical substrings.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: A more efficient approach involves using suffix arrays and the LCP (Longest Common Prefix) array. Suffix arrays help organize all suffixes of the string in lexicographical order, and LCP arrays store the lengths of the longest common prefixes between consecutive suffixes in the suffix array. This can help in efficiently counting distinct substrings.\\n- Implementing Substring Extraction and Suffix Array Construction: Extract the substring for the given query range. Create suffix array by generating all suffixes and sorting them. The complexity of this operation should be carefully considered.\\n- Utilizing LCP Array to Count Distinct Substrings: Employ the Kasai algorithm to compute the LCP array, or another standard algorithm to compute the LCP values efficiently. The number of distinct substrings is the sum of the lengths of all suffixes minus the sum of the LCP values.\\n- Handling Multiple Queries: Iterate through all queries, applying the above steps to each query independently and printing the result for each query.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does the term 'distinct substrings' mean in the context of this problem, and how do we differentiate between two substrings?\",\n    \"If we were to use a brute-force approach to generate all substrings and check for uniqueness, what would be the time complexity, and why might it be inefficient?\",\n    \"Can you explain the concept of a suffix array and how it can be used to count distinct substrings more efficiently?\",\n    \"What is an LCP (Longest Common Prefix) array, and how does it relate to the suffix array in solving this problem?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the number of distinct substrings using the suffix array and LCP array?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Distinct substrings mean that even if the same characters occur at different indices, they are considered the same only if their sequence and positions are identical. Substrings are different if their sequences of characters differ by at least one.\",\n    \"A brute-force approach would involve generating all possible substrings and checking for uniqueness, leading to a time complexity of O(n^2) for each query, where n is the length of the substring. For q queries, the complexity would be O(q*n^2). It's inefficient because it may involve comparing many redundant substrings.\",\n    \"A suffix array is a sorted array of all suffixes of a string.
