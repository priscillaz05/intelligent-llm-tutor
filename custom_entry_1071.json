Three sides of the castle are protected by impassable mountains and the remaining side is occupied by a long wall that is split into n sections. At this moment there are exactly ai archers located at the i-th section of this wall. You know that archer who stands at section i can shoot orcs that attack section located at distance not exceeding r, that is all such sections j that |i - j| \u2264 r. In particular, r = 0 means that archers are only capable of shooting at orcs who attack section i.\\n\\nDenote as defense level of section i the total number of archers who can shoot at the orcs attacking this section. Reliability of the defense plan is the minimum value of defense level of individual wall section.\\n\\nThere is a little time left till the attack so you can't redistribute archers that are already located at the wall. However, there is a reserve of k archers that you can distribute among wall sections in arbitrary way. You would like to achieve maximum possible reliability of the defence plan.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line of the input contains three integers n, r and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 500 000, 0 \u2264 r \u2264 n, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 1018) \u2014 the number of sections of the wall, the maximum distance to other section archers can still shoot and the number of archers yet to be distributed along the wall.

Each section's defense level is the sum of archers within a certain range (r) from it. The core task is to find the optimal distribution of the extra archers to achieve the highest possible minimum defense level.\\n- Formulating a Strategy: A binary search approach is a good choice because we are looking for the maximum possible minimum defense level. We can check if a given defense level is achievable by distributing the available archers. The solve function is used to check if a certain defense level is possible. Build function converts decimal numbers to big and small integers. The solve function iterates through the sections, calculates the current defense level and increases archers count if needed using the available archers. Finally, it returns whether this target is possible with k archers.\\n- Implementation Details: Efficiently calculate the defense level for each section by tracking changes using the minus array. The border variable is used for integer overflow purposes.\\n- Optimizations: The usage of the \\\"minus\\\" array can optimize defense level calculation by storing and removing changes to the defense level as you slide along the wall sections.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does the defense level of a section represent, and how is it calculated?\",\n    \"Why is a binary search approach suitable for this problem?\",\n    \"Can you explain the purpose of the solve function and the logic behind it?\",\n    \"How does the code efficiently calculate the defense level for each section without recomputing the sum for every section?\",\n    \"What is the purpose of the border variable, and how does it prevent overflow issues?\",\n\t\"What would be time complexity of this program?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The defense level of a section represents the total number of archers who can shoot at orcs attacking that section. It is calculated by summing the archers located within a distance 'r' from that section.\",\n    \"A binary search is suitable because we're trying to find the maximum possible minimum defense level. We can test a potential minimum defense level and check if it's achievable by distributing the available archers. If it's achievable, we can try a higher level; otherwise, we try a lower level.\",\n    \"The solve function checks if a given target defense level is achievable with the available archers. It simulates the process of distributing archers along the wall to meet the target level and returns true if it's possible, false otherwise.\",\n    \"The code calculates the defense level efficiently by tracking changes. Instead of summing archers within range r for each wall section, it maintains a running sum and adds/subtracts values as it moves from one section to the next. The \\\"minus\\\" array is utilized to reduce the count from sections that are no longer with the range\",\n    \"The border variable is used to prevent integer overflow issues when manipulating large numbers, especially during the calculations within the solve function.\",\n\t\"The time complexity is O(n log(sum(a) + k)), where n is the number of wall sections, a is the array of archers in each section, and k is the number of additional archers. The dominant factor is the binary search which goes till sum(a) + k. Each binary search step calls the solve function, which takes O(n) time.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
