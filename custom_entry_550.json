You realise that in order to make significant steps quickly, it would help to go to a coding bootcamp in London.\\n\\nProblem is, many of them cost a fortune, and those that don't still involve a significant amount of time off work - who will pay your mortgage?! \\n\\nTo offset this risk, you decide that rather than leaving work totally, you will request a sabbatical so that you can go back to work post bootcamp and be paid while you look for your next role.\\n\\nYou need to approach your boss. Her decision will be based on three parameters:\\n\\nval=your value to the organisation\\nhappiness=her happiness level at the time of asking and finally\\nThe numbers of letters from 'sabbatical' that are present in string `s`.\\n\\nNote that if `s` contains three instances of the letter 'l', that still scores three points, even though there is only one in the word sabbatical.\\n\\nIf the sum of the three parameters (as described above) is > 22, return 'Sabbatical! Boom!', else return 'Back to your desk, boy.'.\\n\\n~~~if:c\\nNOTE: For the C translation you should return a string literal.\\n~~~\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def sabb(stg, value, happiness):\\n\\tsabbatical = value + happiness + sum((1 for c in stg if c in 'sabbatical')) > 22\\n\\treturn 'Sabbatical! Boom!' if sabbatical else 'Back to your desk, boy.'\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem asks to determine if a sabbatical is granted based on three parameters: the value to the organization, the boss's happiness, and the number of letters from the word 'sabbatical' present in a given string. The sum of these parameters must be greater than 22 for the sabbatical to be approved.\\n- Extracting Key Components: Identify that the input consists of a string `stg`, an integer `value`, and an integer `happiness`. Recognize that the number of occurrences of letters from 'sabbatical' in `stg` needs to be counted.\\n- Choosing an Algorithmic Approach: Determine an efficient way to count the occurrences of the relevant letters in the string. Consider using a loop or list comprehension to iterate through the string and check each character.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Consider any potential edge cases, such as an empty string or cases where `value` and `happiness` are very low.\\n- Implementing the Logic: Implement the function to sum the three parameters and return the appropriate string based on whether the sum is greater than 22.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the inputs to the function, and what data types are they?\",\n    \"How do you count the number of characters from 'sabbatical' that are present in the input string?\",\n    \"What should the function return if the sum of the three parameters is greater than 22?\",\n    \"What should the function return if the sum of the three parameters is not greater than 22?\",\n    \"What are some edge cases that need to be considered, and how will they affect the solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The inputs are a string `stg`, an integer `value`, and an integer `happiness`.\",\n    \"Iterate through the input string and check if each character is present in the string 'sabbatical'. Increment a counter for each matching character.\",\n    \"If the sum is greater than 22, the function should return 'Sabbatical! Boom!'\",\n    \"If the sum is not greater than 22, the function should return 'Back to your desk, boy.'\",\n    \"Edge cases include an empty input string or when `value` and `happiness` are zero. These cases don't fundamentally change the logic, but need to be handled correctly to produce the right result.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
