Apparently Manav\u2019s team the 3Horsemen stood ahead of Abhinav\u2019s team akatsuki11 in the contest though both solved the same number of questions .Manav is Abhinav\u2019s greatest rival and Abhinav being adamant about him being The Best gives Manav a challenge described below:\\n\\nFor each positive number N consider the number mirror(N) which is obtained from N by replacing every digit d in the decimal notation(base 10) of N with the digit (9-d). We can now say that mirror(N) is the mirror image of N. For example, reflection of 325 equals 674. Note that leading zeros (if any) should be omitted. So the mirror image of 9 equals 0, so mirror(91) equals 8.\\nLet us define weight as the product of the number and its mirror image i.e. N * mirror(N). Thus, the weight of the number 20 is equal to 20 \u00b779 = 1580.\\n\\nManav is very weak in mathematics and also he doesn\u2019t want to lose this challenge. So now it\u2019s your job to save Manav from Abhinav\u2019s arrogance. Your task is to find the maximum weight of the numbers in the given range [L,R] (including boundaries).\\n\\nInput:\\n\\nFirst line of input contains number of test cases T.

We need to do this for numbers within the given range.\\n- Optimizing the Search: A naive approach would calculate the weight for every number in the range. A smarter approach would consider that the optimal value is likely to be near a power of 10 divided by 2 (e.g. 5, 50, 500 etc.) given the mirror operation.\\n- Handling Constraints: The range [L, R] can be up to 10^9, so efficient computation is important to avoid timeouts.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you calculate the mirror of a given number N?\",\n    \"What is the most efficient way to find the maximum weight within the given range [L, R]? Can you avoid checking every number?\",\n    \"How do you deal with large ranges and potential timeouts?\",\n    \"How do you convert an integer to a list of its digits and back, in order to mirror the number?\",\n    \"What edge cases do I need to consider, for example L=R, or small values of L and R?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"To find the mirror, iterate through the digits of the number. For each digit d, replace it with (9-d). Concatenate these new digits to form the mirrored number. Remove any leading zeros.\",\n    \"Instead of checking every number, focus on numbers near powers of 10 divided by 2. Check if a number near L or R gives a larger result than a number closest to the middle of the range. This is because mirroring has an interesting effect near these points.\",\n    \"Efficient computation is crucial. Using the strategy above should prevent timeouts. Check the weight for only specific numbers, rather than every number in the range.\",\n    \"Convert the integer to a string. Iterate through the characters of the string. Convert each character back to an integer, apply the mirror transformation (9-digit), and convert the result back to a string.  Finally, concatenate all transformed digits.

For small values of L and R, perform the mirror calculation as described.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
