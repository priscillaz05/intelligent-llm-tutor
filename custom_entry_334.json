Instead of enumerating both, the solution aims to compare current tile to expected, and increment counter.\\n- Selecting an Efficient Algorithm: Iterating through the string and keeping track of the expected color. Whenever there is a mismatch, increment the repaint counter and flip expected color.\\n- Implementation Considerations: String manipulation with character by character comparison and conditional update of repaint counter.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the core objective of the problem, and what constraints are in place?\",\n    \"What does it mean for adjacent tiles to have different colors, and how does this affect the total repaints needed?\",\n    \"Is there any algorithm you can come up to solve the problem?\",\n    \"How do you manage iterating through a string and comparing characters, what edge cases exist?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The goal is to minimize repaints so that no two adjacent tiles have the same color, within a string S of length up to 10^5.\",\n    \"If adjacent tiles are the same, then one must be repainted, adding to the repaint count.\",\n    \"Iterate through the string, assume 0101... or 1010... pattern, keep track of repaints necessary.\",\n    \"String manipulation is character by character comparison, the major thing to worry about is memory, and not iterating outside of range.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
