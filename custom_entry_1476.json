This involves maintaining a min-heap of size k and iterating through the array, updating the heap when necessary.\\n- Implementing the Heap-Based Solution: Construct a min-heap to store the k largest elements encountered so far. Initially, populate the heap with the first k elements. Then, for each subsequent element, compare it with the minimum element in the heap. If the element is larger, replace the minimum element with the current element and heapify to maintain the min-heap property.\\n- Returning the Results: After processing all elements in the array, the heap contains the k largest elements.

This suggests using an algorithm that efficiently processes each element in the array while maintaining a data structure of size K.\",\n    \"A min-heap of size k is well-suited because it can store the k largest elements and allows for efficient replacement of the smallest element among them.\",\n    \"The min-heap approach works by maintaining a heap of the k largest elements seen so far. If a new element is larger than the smallest element in the heap (the root of the min-heap), it replaces the smallest element, and the heap is re-heapified to maintain the min-heap property.\",\n    \"If the array is empty, return an empty list. If k is equal to N, return the entire array in descending order.\",\n    \"To convert the min-heap into a list of k largest elements in descending order, repeatedly extract the minimum element from the heap (which is the smallest of the k largest elements) and add it to a list until the heap is empty. Since we are using heapq which is a min heap, and we want the largest element, we should push negative numbers into the heap and then append the negative of the popped number to our result list.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
