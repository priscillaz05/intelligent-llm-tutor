Please note that there are only two dice (these dices are mirror of each other) that satisfy the given constraints (both of them are shown on the picture on the left).\\n\\n<image>\\n\\nAlice and Bob play dice. Alice has built a tower from n dice. We know that in this tower the adjacent dice contact with faces with distinct numbers. Bob wants to uniquely identify the numbers written on the faces of all dice, from which the tower is built. Unfortunately, Bob is looking at the tower from the face, and so he does not see all the numbers on the faces. Bob sees the number on the top of the tower and the numbers on the two adjacent sides (on the right side of the picture shown what Bob sees).\\n\\nHelp Bob, tell whether it is possible to uniquely identify the numbers on the faces of all the dice in the tower, or not.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of dice in the tower.\\n\\nThe second line contains an integer x (1 \u2264 x \u2264 6) \u2014 the number Bob sees at the top of the tower. Next n lines contain two space-separated integers each: the i-th line contains numbers ai, bi (1 \u2264 ai, bi \u2264 6; ai \u2260 bi) \u2014 the numbers Bob sees on the two sidelong faces of the i-th dice in the tower.\\n\\nConsider the dice in the tower indexed from top to bottom from 1 to n.

The goal is to determine if Bob can uniquely identify all the dice, which translates to checking if any of the hidden faces (bottom or the opposite faces of the sides Bob sees) contain the same numbers that Bob already sees on any given die.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints: Each die has numbers 1 to 6, and opposite faces sum to 7. The input provides the number of dice (n), the top face (x), and the two side faces (a, b) for each die.\\n- Formulating a Logical Condition: If any of the hidden faces of a die have a number that is also visible, then Bob cannot uniquely identify the numbers on the dice because he'd be seeing the same number twice, which is not allowed. Hidden faces are the bottom (7 - top) and the opposite faces of the sides Bob sees (7 - a, 7 - b).\\n- Devising the Algorithm: For each die, check if the top number 'x', its opposite (7 - x), or the side faces 'a' and 'b' along with their opposites (7 - a and 7 - b) contain any duplicates in the set of visible faces for that die. If so, Bob can't uniquely identify the dice. Iterate through all dice and if no such duplication is found, then Bob can uniquely identify them.\\n- Edge Cases and Simplifications: The problem statement guarantees a valid dice tower. If 'x' or its opposite (7-x) are in the side faces a or b, then it not possible to identify the dice\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What numbers are considered 'hidden' on each die based on what Bob sees, and why is this important?\",\n    \"If a 'hidden' face of a die has a number that is equal to a 'visible' face on that same die, what does that imply for Bob's ability to identify the dice?\",\n    \"Can you outline the process of checking each die to determine if it can be uniquely identified, considering the given constraints?\",\n    \"In the context of this problem, what conditions would lead to a 'YES' output, and what conditions would lead to a 'NO' output?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The 'hidden' numbers are the bottom face (7 - top number) and the faces opposite to the visible side faces (7 - side1, 7 - side2). This is important because if any of these hidden numbers are the same as a visible number on that die, Bob cannot uniquely identify it.\",\n    \"If a 'hidden' face has a number equal to a 'visible' face on the same die, it means Bob is seeing the same number twice from one die, making it impossible to uniquely identify the faces of that specific die, and hence the entire tower.\",\n    \"For each die, you need to check if the top number, the two side numbers, or their corresponding opposite numbers (calculated using the rule that opposite faces sum to 7) contain any duplicates. Specifically, check if the top number x OR its opposite 7-x are the same as either of the side numbers a or b. Also check if a equals b or 7-b, and if b equals 7-a. If any of these conditions are true for any die, output \\\"NO\\\". Otherwise, output \\\"YES\\\".\",\n    \"A 'YES' output means that for every die in the tower, none of the hidden faces contain the same number as the visible faces, allowing Bob to uniquely identify each die. A 'NO' output means that at least one die has a hidden face with a number identical to a visible face, making unique identification impossible.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
