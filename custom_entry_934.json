These doughnuts are called Doughnut 1, Doughnut 2, ..., Doughnut N. In order to make one Doughnut i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 N), she needs to consume m_i grams of Moto. She cannot make a non-integer number of doughnuts, such as 0.5 doughnuts.\\nNow, she has X grams of Moto. She decides to make as many doughnuts as possible for a party tonight. However, since the tastes of the guests differ, she will obey the following condition:\\n - For each of the N kinds of doughnuts, make at least one doughnut of that kind.\\nAt most how many doughnuts can be made here?

If she makes one doughnut for each of the three kinds, she consumes 120 + 100 + 140 = 360 grams of Moto. From the 640 grams of Moto that remains here, she can make additional six Doughnuts 2.

Then figure out which doughnut uses the least \\\"Moto\\\" to make the most with the remaining \\\"Moto\\\"\\n- Formulate Algorithmic Strategy: Determine the optimal strategy. First, make one of each type. Then, use the remaining \\\"Moto\\\" to make as many of the doughnut type that requires the least \\\"Moto\\\" as possible. Find the minimum m_i, subtract the sum of all m_i from X.  Divide the remainder by the minimum m_i. Add this quotient to N to get the final number of doughnuts.\\n- Implementation Details: Properly handle integer division to avoid fractional doughnuts.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the core goal of this problem, and what constraints are in place?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: The core goal is to maximize the number of doughnuts produced given a certain amount of 'Moto' (X grams), with the constraint that at least one of each type of doughnut (N types) must be made.\",\n    \"What would be an efficient strategy to determine the maximum number of doughnuts that can be made while adhering to the constraints?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: First make one of each doughnut type.
