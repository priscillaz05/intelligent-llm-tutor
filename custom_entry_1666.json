The capital of ByteLand is a city, numbered $\\\\mbox{1}$, and all the roads go away from the capital. So people use these roads to reach any city from the capital. But it is impossible to reach the capital from a city by roads. \\n\\nTo solve this problem, there is a system of teleporters. Each city has a teleporter in it. Each teleporter has a value of strength. Let's say, the $\\\\boldsymbol{i}$-th one has the value of strength equal to $A_i$. This means that by using the teleporter, you'll become $A_i$ cities close to the capital (the same as going $A_i$ roads in the capital direction). If the distance to the capital is less than $A_i$, you'll simply move to the capital instead.\\n\\nThe road system of ByteLand and the initial teleports' strengths will be given to you. You'll also be given $\\\\mbox{M}$ queries about the teleport network in ByteLand. These queries will have one of the following forms:\\n\\n$\\\\mbox{1}$ $\\\\mbox{X}$ $\\\\mathbf{Y}$ : The strength of the teleport in the city with the number $\\\\mbox{X}$ becomes equal to $\\\\mathbf{Y}$;\\n\\n$2$ $\\\\mbox{X}$ : Please output the minimal number of teleports that needs to be used to get from the city with the number $\\\\mbox{X}$ to the capital. We can use only teleports in this query, but not the roads!\\n\\nInput Format\\n\\nThe first line of input will contain two space-separated integers $N$ and $\\\\mbox{M}$.\\n\\nThe second line will contain $N$ space separated integers $A_1,A_2,\\\\ldots,A_N$ - the initial strengths of the teleports.\\n\\nThe following $(N-1)$ lines will contain pairs of space separated positive integers $\\\\mbox{X}$ and $\\\\mathbf{Y}$ with the meaning that there is a road between the cities with the numbers $\\\\mbox{X}$ and $\\\\mathbf{Y}$.\\n\\nEach of following $\\\\mbox{M}$ lines will contain a query in one of the formats, described above.\\n\\nConstraints  \\n\\n1 <= N <= 100000 \\n\\n1 <= M <= 100000 \\n\\n1 <= A_{i} <= 10000\\n\\nOutput Format\\n\\nFor each query of the second type, output an answer on a separate line. \\n\\nSample Input\\n5 2\\n1 2 1 2 1\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 4\\n4 5\\n2 4\\n2 5\\n\\nSample Output\\n2\\n3\\n\\nExplanation\\n\\nIn the first query, we jump two cities up and appear in the second city, then we jump once more and move to the capital.\\n\\nIn the second query, we jump one city up and appear in the city $\\\\begin{array}{c}4\\\\end{array}$. From that city we need $2$ more teleportations to get to the capital (this is yet the first query).\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"(n, m) = map(int, input().split())\\nteleporters = list(map(int, input().split()))\\npaths = []\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\tpaths.append([])\\nfor i in range(n - 1):\\n\\t(a, b) = map(lambda x: int(x) - 1, input().split())\\n\\tif not paths[a]:\\n\\t\\tpaths[b].append([a, b])\\n\\tfor path in paths[a]:\\n\\t\\tpaths[b].append(path + [b])\\nfor i in range(m):\\n\\tinp = list(map(int, input().split()))\\n\\tif inp[0] == 1:\\n\\t\\tteleporters[inp[1] - 1] = inp[2]\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tx = inp[1] - 1\\n\\t\\ttmp = -1\\n\\t\\tfor path in paths[x]:\\n\\t\\t\\tres = 0\\n\\t\\t\\tj = len(path)\\n\\t\\t\\twhile j > 1:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tj -= teleporters[j - 1]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tres += 1\\n\\t\\t\\tif tmp < 0 or tmp > res:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttmp = res\\n\\t\\tprint(tmp)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understand the problem: We're given a tree-like structure representing ByteLand's road system with N cities. We have teleporters in each city with varying strengths, enabling travel towards the capital (city 1). The goal is to answer M queries, which are either updates to teleporter strengths or requests to find the minimum teleports needed to reach the capital from a given city.\\n- Data structures: Represent the road system as a graph. Since the roads are unidirectional and lead away from the capital, we can use adjacency lists or, more specifically, store paths from the capital to each city. Store teleporter strengths in a list.\\n- Query handling: For type 1 queries, update the teleporter strength at the specified city. For type 2 queries, calculate the minimum number of teleports from a city to the capital.\\n- Path to capital: For type 2 queries, use the stored path from the capital to the given city. Simulate teleporting from the given city towards the capital based on the teleporter strengths along the path. Keep track of the number of teleports used. If the teleport strength is larger than the remaining path length, consider it as moving directly to the capital.\\n- Optimizations: Precompute the paths from the capital to each city to avoid repeated pathfinding. When processing type 2 queries, optimize the teleport simulation process by efficiently calculating the number of steps taken based on the teleporter strengths.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How should I represent the road network to efficiently find the path from a city to the capital?\",\n    \"What data structure is appropriate for storing and updating teleporter strengths?\",\n    \"How should I handle the case where a teleporter's strength exceeds the distance to the capital?\",\n    \"How can I optimize the calculation of the minimum number of teleports in type 2 queries?\",\n    \"What edge cases should I consider, and how do I handle them?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Since roads are unidirectional and lead away from the capital, store the paths from the capital to each city. This allows efficient retrieval of the path for any city during query processing. You can compute these paths using Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from the capital.\",\n    \"Use a list (or array) where the index represents the city number, and the value at that index represents the teleporter strength.

Stop when you reach the capital.\",\n    \"Consider edge cases like:\\n    - City doesn't exist or is invalid (return -1 or an error code).\\n    - Teleporter strength is zero (cannot move, path is infinite, consider it unreachable).
