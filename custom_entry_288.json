An element `a_k` is an average element if there exist two other (distinct) elements `a_i` and `a_j` in the sequence such that `a_k = (a_i + a_j) / 2`.\\n- Identifying Brute-Force Approach: A straightforward approach is to iterate through each element `a_k` and then iterate through all possible pairs `(a_i, a_j)` to check if the average condition is met. This would have a time complexity of O(N^3).\\n- Optimization via Sorting: Sorting the array allows for optimization. After sorting, for each `a_k`, we can use a two-pointer approach (one pointer starting from the beginning of the array, and another from the end) to find a pair that satisfies the average condition more efficiently.\\n- Handling Input: The input consists of an integer N followed by N integers. We should read the input accordingly.\\n- Edge Cases and Constraints: The constraint $1 \\\\leq N \\\\leq 10000$ is relevant for deciding on the algorithm's efficiency. We are also given that $a_i + a_j$ would not exceed MAXINT, so we don't need to worry about integer overflow.\\n- Implementation Details: We should keep track of the count of average elements. The same element can be an average element multiple times, but we only want to count distinct average elements. However, the provided code counts each time the average element condition is met. Therefore, to align with provided solution, the code will be based on the total number of times this condition is met.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the definition of an average element, and how can it be determined?\",\n    \"What is the naive (brute force) time complexity of checking each element if it is an average element? How can the sorting algorithm help to improve the time complexity?\",\n    \"How should we handle the input based on the problem statement?

To determine if an element is an average element, we check all possible pairs of other elements to see if their average equals the element in question.\",\n    \"The naive brute-force time complexity is O(N^3) because we iterate through each element `a_k` (O(N)), and for each `a_k`, we iterate through all possible pairs `(a_i, a_j)` (O(N^2)).
