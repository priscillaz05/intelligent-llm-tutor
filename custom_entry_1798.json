The output needs to be sorted in a specific manner: groups sorted by size (descending) and then alphabetically by the first element if group sizes are the same, elements within each group must be sorted alphabetically.\\n- Handling Duplicates: The first step is to remove duplicates from the input sequence to ensure that only unique strings are considered.\\n- Identifying Rotations: For each string, determine if other strings in the input sequence are rotations of it. A simple way to check for rotation is to concatenate a string with itself and see if the other string is a substring of the concatenated string (after converting both to lowercase).\\n- Grouping Rotations: Store the groups of rotated strings. Ensure that the same set of strings (regardless of order) isn't added multiple times.\\n- Sorting: Finally, sort each group alphabetically and sort the groups based on size in descending order, breaking ties alphabetically.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you efficiently remove duplicates from the input sequence while preserving the original order?\",\n    \"What's an effective way to check if one string is a rotation of another, ignoring case?\",\n    \"How do you ensure that the same set of rotated strings is not added multiple times to the result in different orders?\",\n    \"What is the sorting criteria for the groups, and how would you implement this sorting using Python?\",\n    \"How can the string rotation logic handle strings with whitespaces?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"You can use `list(dict.fromkeys(seq))` to remove duplicates while preserving order. Dictionaries in Python 3.7+ maintain insertion order.\",\n    \"Convert both strings to lowercase. Concatenate one of the strings with itself (e.g., `s1 + s1`).

Then check if this sorted list already exists in the result list.\",\n    \"Sort the groups first by their size in descending order (using `len` as the key), and then alphabetically by the first element if sizes are equal. You can use `sorted(groups, key=lambda x: (-len(x), x[0]))`.\",\n    \"The given condition states that whitespaces are valid characters, therefore the comparison should be done including whitespaces.
