Recognize the need to return 1 if no primes exist in the range and to compute the product modulo 10^9 + 7 to prevent overflow.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Be aware of the constraints on L and R, especially the upper limit of 10^9, which suggests that directly iterating through all numbers in the range and checking for primality might be too slow. The constraint on the difference between R and L (R - L <= 10^6) indicates a potential optimization using a segmented sieve.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Choose a suitable primality test or sieve algorithm. Consider the Sieve of Eratosthenes or a segmented version to handle large ranges efficiently. Recognize that pre-computing primes up to sqrt(R) and then using them to sieve the range [L, R] is a common optimization.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Handle edge cases such as L=1 correctly and ensure the modulo operation is applied at each multiplication to avoid overflow. Account for the possibility of an empty set of primes within the given range by returning 1.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the key constraints and requirements of the problem, and how do they influence the choice of algorithm?\",\n    \"Given the large range of possible inputs (up to 10^9), how can we efficiently determine if a number is prime without iterating through all possible divisors?\",\n    \"How would you implement a segmented sieve approach to identify primes within the range [L, R] efficiently?\",\n    \"What are the potential edge cases we should consider, such as when L or R is equal to 1, or when there are no primes within the specified range?\",\n    \"How can we handle potential integer overflow issues when calculating the product of primes, especially when dealing with large numbers?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The key constraints are the range 1 \u2264 L \u2264 R \u2264 10^{9} and 0 \u2264 L - R \u2264 10^{6}.
