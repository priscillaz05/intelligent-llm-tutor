Xryuseix, who lives in a grid of cities, has come up with a new cryptography to decide where to meet.\\n\\nThe ciphertext consists of the $ N $ character string $ S $, and the $ S_i $ character determines the direction of movement from the current location. The direction of movement is as follows.\\n\\n\\n* A ~ M: Go north one square.\\n* N ~ Z: Go south one square.\\n* a ~ m: Go east one square.\\n* n ~ z: Go west one square.\\n\\n\\nBy the way, xryuseix wanted to tell yryuseiy-chan where to meet for a date with a ciphertext, but he noticed that the ciphertext was redundant.\\n\\nFor example, suppose you have the ciphertext \\\"ANA\\\". It goes north by $ 1 $, south by $ 1 $, and then north by $ 1 $. This is equivalent to the ciphertext that goes north by $ 1 $. , \\\"ANA\\\" = \\\"A\\\", which can be simplified. Xryuseix wanted to simplify the ciphertext so that yryuseiy would not make a detour.\\n\\nSo you decided to write a program to simplify the ciphertext instead of xryuseix.

The goal is to simplify the string to represent the shortest path to the same destination.\\n- Decomposing Movement: Need to process the input string and track the net movement in the North-South and East-West directions. This can be done by accumulating movements based on the character categories.\\n- Simplification Strategy: After processing the string, the net movement in each direction is known.  The simplified string should represent this net movement using the minimum number of characters. Determine which character to use based on the sign of the net movement (A for North, N for South, a for East, n for West).\\n- String Construction: Build the simplified string based on the calculated net movements. The string should have the appropriate number of characters corresponding to the net movement in each direction.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you represent the directions and movements?\",\n    \"How do you keep track of the total movement in each direction?\",\n    \"Given the total movements, how do you construct the shortest path?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases to consider?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A-M represent North, N-Z represent South, a-m represent East, and n-z represent West. Each character corresponds to a movement of one unit in the respective direction.\",\n    \"Use two variables (e.g., x and y) to track the net movement. Increment or decrement these variables based on the direction indicated by each character.\",\n    \"Determine the absolute value of the net movement in each direction. For North-South movement, use 'A' if the net movement is positive and 'N' if negative. For East-West movement, use 'a' if the net movement is positive and 'n' if negative. The simplified string is the concatenation of these characters repeated by the absolute value of their corresponding net movements.\",\n    \"If the net movements in both directions are zero, the simplified string should be empty. If the input string is empty, the simplified string should also be empty.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
