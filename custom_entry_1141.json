Also, consider constraints on the size of the array and the range of values in the array.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: The straightforward approach is to count the occurrences of each element in the array. A dictionary is utilized in the ground truth solution to store elements and their frequency.\\n- Implementation Details: Loop through the array, and for each element, either increment its counter in the dictionary, or add a new entry if the element is encountered for the first time. Then, iterate through the dictionary to find if there is an element with the frequency bigger than n/2.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for an element to be a majority element in an array?\",\n    \"What should be returned if there is no majority element in the given array?\",\n    \"What data structure can be used to efficiently store the frequency of each element in an array, and why is it suitable for this task?\",\n    \"What are the space and time complexity implications of choosing this data structure to find majority elements?\",\n    \"How would you handle the constraints that N can be up to 10^7, and Ai can be up to 10^6?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A majority element is an element that appears more than N/2 times in the array, where N is the size of the array.\",\n    \"If there is no majority element, the function should return -1.\",\n    \"A dictionary (hash map) is ideal as it allows for O(1) average time complexity for insertion and retrieval of element counts.\",\n    \"Using a dictionary yields an average time complexity of O(N) and a space complexity of O(K), where K is the number of distinct elements.

For Ai, Since the constraint is less than 10^6 the dictionary should still work as there are a limited number of distinct elements to store\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
