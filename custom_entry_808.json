It is also known for the office of Lyft Level 5.\\n\\nLyft has become so popular so that it is now used by all $m$ taxi drivers in the city, who every day transport the rest of the city residents\u00a0\u2014 $n$ riders.\\n\\nEach resident (including taxi drivers) of Palo-Alto lives in its unique location (there is no such pair of residents that their coordinates are the same).\\n\\nThe Lyft system is very clever: when a rider calls a taxi, his call does not go to all taxi drivers, but only to the one that is the closest to that person. If there are multiple ones with the same distance, then to taxi driver with a smaller coordinate is selected.\\n\\nBut one morning the taxi drivers wondered: how many riders are there that would call the given taxi driver if they were the first to order a taxi on that day? In other words, you need to find for each taxi driver $i$ the number $a_{i}$\u00a0\u2014 the number of riders that would call the $i$-th taxi driver when all drivers and riders are at their home?\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\\\le n,m \\\\le 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 number of riders and taxi drivers.\\n\\nThe second line contains $n + m$ integers $x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_{n+m}$ ($1 \\\\le x_1 < x_2 < \\\\ldots < x_{n+m} \\\\le 10^9$), where $x_i$ is the coordinate where the $i$-th resident lives. \\n\\nThe third line contains $n + m$ integers $t_1, t_2, \\\\ldots, t_{n+m}$ ($0 \\\\le t_i \\\\le 1$). If $t_i = 1$, then the $i$-th resident is a taxi driver, otherwise $t_i = 0$.\\n\\nIt is guaranteed that the number of $i$ such that $t_i = 1$ is equal to $m$.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nPrint $m$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_{m}$, where $a_i$ is the answer for the $i$-th taxi driver. The taxi driver has the number $i$ if among all the taxi drivers he lives in the $i$-th smallest coordinate (see examples for better understanding).\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n3 1\\n1 2 3 10\\n0 0 1 0\\n\\nOutput\\n3 \\nInput\\n3 2\\n2 3 4 5 6\\n1 0 0 0 1\\n\\nOutput\\n2 1 \\nInput\\n1 4\\n2 4 6 10 15\\n1 1 1 1 0\\n\\nOutput\\n0 0 0 1 \\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first example, we have only one taxi driver, which means an order from any of $n$ riders will go to him.\\n\\nIn the second example, the first taxi driver lives at the point with the coordinate $2$, and the second one lives at the point with the coordinate $6$. Obviously, the nearest taxi driver to the rider who lives on the $3$ coordinate is the first one, and to the rider who lives on the coordinate $5$ is the second one. The rider who lives on the $4$ coordinate has the same distance to the first and the second taxi drivers, but since the first taxi driver has a smaller coordinate, the call from this rider will go to the first taxi driver.\\n\\nIn the third example, we have one rider and the taxi driver nearest to him is the fourth one.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"(n, m) = map(int, input().split())\\nx = list(map(int, input().split()))\\nt = list(map(int, input().split()))\\nans = [0 for i in range(m)]\\ntax = []\\nfor i in range(n + m):\\n\\tif t[i] == 1:\\n\\t\\ttax.append(x[i])\\nj = 0\\nfor i in range(n + m):\\n\\tif t[i] == 0:\\n\\t\\twhile j < m - 1 and abs(x[i] - tax[j]) > abs(x[i] - tax[j + 1]):\\n\\t\\t\\tj += 1\\n\\t\\tans[j] += 1\\nprint(' '.join(list(map(str, ans))))\\nexit(0)\\ni = 0\\nc = 0\\nwhile t[i] == 0:\\n\\tc += 1\\n\\ti += 1\\nans[i] = c\\nlt = i\\ni += 1\\nwhile i < n + m:\\n\\tc = 0\\n\\twhile i < n + m and t[i] == 0:\\n\\t\\tc += 1\\n\\t\\ti += 1\\n\\tif i < n + m:\\n\\t\\tans[lt] += c // 2 + c % 2\\n\\t\\tans[i] += c // 2\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tans[lt] += c\\n\\tlt = i\\n\\ti += 1\\nfor i in range(n + m):\\n\\tif t[i] == 1:\\n\\t\\tprint(ans[i], end=' ')\\nprint()\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem asks us to determine, for each taxi driver, how many riders would choose them based on proximity. The closest taxi driver (with the smallest coordinate in case of ties) is selected by each rider.\\n- Data Structures: Store the coordinates of riders and taxi drivers separately. An array to store the count of riders for each taxi driver is also required. The input coordinates and types are already provided as lists.\\n- Algorithm Selection: For each rider, find the closest taxi driver. Iterate through all riders and, for each rider, iterate through all taxi drivers to find the closest one.  Account for the tie-breaking rule (smaller coordinate).  Increment the count for the selected taxi driver.\\n- Edge Case Handling: There will always be at least one taxi driver according to the problem constraints. There might be scenarios where a taxi driver has no riders selecting them.\\n- Optimization Considerations: The taxi driver and rider coordinates are already sorted, potentially allowing for some optimization, but the core logic requires comparison of distances between each rider and each taxi driver.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you store the coordinates of riders and taxi drivers, and how would you differentiate between them?\",\n    \"What is the most straightforward approach to find the closest taxi driver for each rider, given the constraints of the problem?\",\n    \"How can you handle the tie-breaking condition where multiple taxi drivers are equidistant from a rider?\",\n    \"How can you optimize the search for the nearest taxi, considering the sorted order of coordinates?\",\n    \"What data structure would be best suited to store the results (number of riders assigned to each taxi driver)?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Store the coordinates in a single array 'x' and use the corresponding 't' array to identify taxi drivers (t[i] == 1) and riders (t[i] == 0). Create separate lists for taxi driver coordinates and rider coordinates if needed, based on the 't' array.\",\n    \"Iterate through each rider and, for each rider, iterate through all taxi drivers to calculate the distance. Keep track of the minimum distance and the corresponding taxi driver index.\",\n    \"If multiple taxi drivers have the same minimum distance, select the one with the smaller coordinate value (i.e., the smaller index in the sorted list of taxi driver coordinates).\",\n    \"Since the coordinates are sorted, we might explore strategies like binary search to quickly identify the nearest taxi driver for each rider. However, given the constraints and sizes it may not give a large optimization in practice.\",\n    \"An array or list of size 'm' (number of taxi drivers) is appropriate.
