This preprocessing step simplifies the problem without affecting the answer.\\n- Dynamic Programming Approach: Use dynamic programming to solve the problem. `dp[i][j]` stores the minimum number of operations to delete the substring `s[i:j+1]`. The base case is when the substring has length 1, in which case the answer is 1.\\n- Transition Function: The transition function considers two cases. Either we delete `s[i]` first, then delete the remaining substring `s[i+1:j+1]`, or we find some `k` such that `s[i] == s[k]` and delete `s[i:k]` and `s[k+1:j+1]` recursively.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean to delete a contiguous substring with identical characters, and how does it affect the remaining string?\",\n    \"How can the string be simplified before applying dynamic programming to optimize space and reduce complexity?\",\n    \"What should be the base case for the dynamic programming approach?\",\n    \"What are the different scenarios to consider when computing the minimum number of operations for a substring using dynamic programming?\",\n    \"After compressing the input string, how does it impact the final answer and the approach of dynamic programming?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Deleting a contiguous substring with identical characters means removing a sequence of consecutive characters that are the same. This simplifies the string by removing part of it, which could reveal new opportunities for deleting identical contiguous characters.\",\n    \"The string can be simplified by replacing all consecutive occurrences of the same character with a single instance of that character, essentially creating a compressed version of the original string. This reduces the length of the string while preserving the core deletion problem.\",\n    \"The base case for the dynamic programming approach should be when the substring's length is 1, meaning there's only one character. In this case, only one operation is needed to delete it, so dp[i][i] = 1.\",\n    \"When computing the minimum operations for a substring s[i:j+1], we can either delete s[i] and then optimally delete s[i+1:j+1], or find some index k where s[i] == s[k] and delete s[i:k] and s[k+1:j+1] recursively. We then take the minimum of all possibilities.\",\n    \"Compressing the input string streamlines the dynamic programming approach since consecutive identical characters no longer need to be considered separately. The dp array directly reflects the compressed string.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
