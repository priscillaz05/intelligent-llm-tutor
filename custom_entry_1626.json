"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"Vasya goes to visit his classmate Petya. Vasya knows that Petya's apartment number is $n$. \\n\\nThere is only one entrance in Petya's house and the distribution of apartments is the following: the first floor contains $2$ apartments, every other floor contains $x$ apartments each. Apartments are numbered starting from one, from the first floor. I.e. apartments on the first floor have numbers $1$ and $2$, apartments on the second floor have numbers from $3$ to $(x + 2)$, apartments on the third floor have numbers from $(x + 3)$ to $(2 \\\\cdot x + 2)$, and so on.\\n\\nYour task is to find the number of floor on which Petya lives. Assume that the house is always high enough to fit at least $n$ apartments.\\n\\nYou have to answer $t$ independent test cases.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.\\n\\nThe only line of the test case contains two integers $n$ and $x$ ($1 \\\\le n, x \\\\le 1000$) \u2014 the number of Petya's apartment and the number of apartments on each floor of the house except the first one (there are two apartments on the first floor).\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nFor each test case, print the answer: the number of floor on which Petya lives.\\n\\n\\n-----Example-----\\nInput\\n4\\n7 3\\n1 5\\n22 5\\n987 13\\n\\nOutput\\n3\\n1\\n5\\n77\\n\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nConsider the first test case of the example: the first floor contains apartments with numbers $1$ and $2$, the second one contains apartments with numbers $3$, $4$ and $5$, the third one contains apartments with numbers $6$, $7$ and $8$. Therefore, Petya lives on the third floor.\\n\\nIn the second test case of the example, Petya lives in the apartment $1$ which is on the first floor.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"t = int(input())\\nfor _ in range(t):\\n\\t(n, x) = map(int, input().split())\\n\\ttemp = (n - 2) % x\\n\\tif n in [1, 2]:\\n\\t\\tprint(1)\\n\\telif temp == 0:\\n\\t\\tprint((n - 2) // x + 1)\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tprint((n - 2) // x + 2)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding Problem Constraints: The problem involves determining the floor number of an apartment given the apartment number 'n' and the number of apartments 'x' on each floor (except the first, which has 2).  The input includes multiple test cases.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Consider the cases where n is 1 or 2, which directly correspond to the first floor. Also handle cases where 'n' is such that it falls exactly on the last apartment of a floor.\\n- Devising an Algorithmic Strategy: Calculate the floor number by subtracting the number of apartments on the first floor (2) from 'n' and then dividing the result by 'x'.  If the result is a whole number, the floor number is the result of the division plus one.  If not, add 2 to the result of the integer division.\\n- Implementing the Solution: Use the modulo operator to determine whether apartment 'n' falls exactly on the last apartment on the given floor.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does the different number of apartments on the first floor affect the floor calculation?\",\n    \"How do you account for the possibility that the apartment is located on the first floor?\",\n    \"How do you determine the number of floors to traverse to find the apartment when it's not on the first floor?\",\n    \"What edge cases need to be addressed in this problem?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The first floor has a fixed number of 2 apartments, whereas all other floors have 'x' apartments. This means that when calculating the floor number for apartments beyond the first floor, we need to subtract 2 from the target apartment number to adjust for the first floor.\",\n    \"If the apartment number is 1 or 2, then the apartment is on the first floor, and the answer is simply 1.\",\n    \"To find the floor number beyond the first floor, subtract 2 from the apartment number 'n' to account for the first floor's apartments. Then divide this result by 'x', the number of apartments on subsequent floors. The integer part of this division plus 1 (or 2 depending if n-2 is divisible by x) gives the floor number.\",\n    \"The primary edge cases are: 1. When the apartment number 'n' is 1 or 2 (first floor). 2. When (n - 2) is perfectly divisible by x, indicating the apartment is the last on that floor, therefore the floor is (n-2)//x + 1 3. When (n-2) is NOT perfectly divisible by x, you must round UP to the next floor, thus (n-2)//x + 2\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
