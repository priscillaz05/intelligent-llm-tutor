In each step, we subtract the largest digit of the current number from the number itself.\\n- Algorithm Selection: Since the goal is to minimize the number of steps, we should always subtract the largest possible digit in each step. This is a greedy approach.\\n- Implementation Details:  The code needs to extract digits, identify the largest digit, perform the subtraction, and repeat until the number is zero. It also needs to count the number of subtractions performed. We should handle the case when the initial number is 0 separately.\\n- Edge Cases: Handle edge case of input 0, and ensure code functions with large input values by using int()\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the core idea behind finding the minimum number of operations, and how do you ensure you're taking the optimal step each time?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently find the largest digit of a given number in string format?\",\n    \"How do you handle the edge case where the input number is zero, and why is it important to handle it separately?\",\n    \"If the input number is a very large integer (up to 10^18), how might that impact the implementation, and what steps would you take to address this?\",\n    \"After each subtraction, how do you update the number to be used in the next iteration, and what data type conversions are needed?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The core idea is to always subtract the largest digit from the current number in each step. This greedy approach guarantees that we reduce the number as quickly as possible, leading to the minimum number of operations.\",\n    \"Convert the number to a string, then convert each character (digit) back to an integer, and then find the maximum among those integers using the max() function.\",\n    \"If the input is 0, no subtractions are needed. Directly output 0 to handle this trivial case. It's important to handle it separately to avoid entering an infinite loop.\",\n    \"For very large integers (up to 10^18), ensure that you are using int to store the input number. Since the algorithm's time complexity depends on the number of subtractions, it could potentially run for a long time, but the constraints of the problem allow it to run in reasonable time.\",\n    \"After each subtraction, the number is updated by simply assigning the result of the subtraction to the variable representing the current number. The number should then be converted back to a string so that the largest digit can be identified again for the next iteration.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
