For example, parenthesis sequences \\\"()()\\\", \\\"(())\\\" are correct (the resulting expressions are: \\\"(1+1)+(1+1)\\\", \\\"((1+1)+1)\\\"), while \\\")(\\\" and \\\")\\\" are not. Note that the empty string is a correct parenthesis sequence by definition.\\n\\nWe define that $|s|$ as the length of string $s$. A strict prefix $s[1\\\\dots l]$ $(1\\\\leq l< |s|)$ of a string $s = s_1s_2\\\\dots s_{|s|}$ is string $s_1s_2\\\\dots s_l$. Note that the empty string and the whole string are not strict prefixes of any string by the definition.\\n\\nHaving learned these definitions, he comes up with a new problem. He writes down a string $s$ containing only characters \\\"(\\\", \\\")\\\" and \\\"?\\\". And what he is going to do, is to replace each of the \\\"?\\\" in $s$ independently by one of \\\"(\\\" and \\\")\\\" to make all strict prefixes of the new sequence not a correct parenthesis sequence, while the new sequence should be a correct parenthesis sequence.\\n\\nAfter all, he is just a primary school student so this problem is too hard for him to solve. As his best friend, can you help him to replace the question marks? If there are many solutions, any of them is acceptable.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains a single integer $|s|$ ($1\\\\leq |s|\\\\leq 3 \\\\cdot 10^5$), the length of the string.\\n\\nThe second line contains a string $s$, containing only \\\"(\\\", \\\")\\\" and \\\"?\\\".\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nA single line contains a string representing the answer.\\n\\nIf there are many solutions, any of them is acceptable.\\n\\nIf there is no answer, print a single line containing \\\":(\\\" (without the quotes).\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n6\\n(?????\\n\\nOutput\\n(()())\\nInput\\n10\\n(???(???(?\\n\\nOutput\\n:(\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import sys\\nsys.setrecursionlimit(20000000)\\ninput = sys.stdin.readline\\nn = int(input())\\ns = input().rstrip()\\nans = []\\ncount = 0\\nfor i in s:\\n\\tif i == '(': \\n\\t\\tans.append(1)\\n\\telif i == ')':\\n\\t\\tans.append(-1)\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tans.append(0)\\n\\t\\tcount += 1\\nx = sum(ans)\\nif abs(x) > count or x % 2 != count % 2:\\n\\tprint(':(')\\n\\texit()\\nhi = (x + count) // 2\\nmi = count - hi\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\tif ans[i] == 0 and mi:\\n\\t\\tans[i] = 1\\n\\t\\tmi -= 1\\n\\telif ans[i] == 0:\\n\\t\\tans[i] = -1\\nrui = [0] * (n + 1)\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\trui[i + 1] = rui[i] + ans[i]\\n\\tif rui[i + 1] <= 0 and i != n - 1:\\n\\t\\tprint(':(')\\n\\t\\texit()\\n\\tif ans[i] == 1:\\n\\t\\tans[i] = '('\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tans[i] = ')'\\nprint(''.join(ans))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The task is to replace '?' characters in a string with '(' or ')' such that the resulting string is a correct parenthesis sequence, but none of its strict prefixes are. This means the final string should have a balanced number of '(' and ')', and for any prefix, the number of '(' must be greater than the number of ')' unless it's the complete string.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: The constraints on prefixes being incorrect parenthesis sequences impose a challenge. We need to ensure that the number of closing parentheses never exceeds the number of opening parentheses in any strict prefix.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: We can count the existing opening and closing parentheses. Based on that, we can determine how many remaining opening and closing parentheses are needed. Assign '(' or ')' to '?' characters based on this calculation. Also check at each index prefix sum for correctness. First fill in as many open parenthesis where we can and after that close parenthesis.\\n- Implementing the filling and verification: Iterate through the string. Determine how many '(' and ')' need to be added. Try to add them to the question marks. Check the sum of open and closed parenthesis is never becoming negative for a prefix and sum is 0 for the entire string.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you define a correct parenthesis sequence, and what properties must it have?\",\n    \"What does it mean for a strict prefix of a string to not be a correct parenthesis sequence?\",\n    \"Given the counts of '(', ')', and '?' in the input string, how can you determine the number of '(' and ')' needed to replace the '?' characters?\",\n    \"How do you ensure that all strict prefixes are not correct parenthesis sequences while the full string is a correct parenthesis sequence?\",\n    \"When assigning '(' or ')' to '?', how do you make sure that no prefix becomes an invalid parenthesis sequence(more close than open parenthesis)?\",\n    \"How to account for possible edge cases like when no solution exists?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A correct parenthesis sequence can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting '1' and '+' between the parentheses. This means that the number of opening parentheses must equal the number of closing parentheses, and for any prefix of the sequence, the number of opening parentheses must be greater than or equal to the number of closing parentheses.\",\n    \"A strict prefix is any substring starting from the beginning of the string, excluding the empty string and the full string itself.  For it not to be a correct parenthesis sequence, at least one of the requirements is not valid.\",\n    \"First, calculate the difference between the counts of '(' and ')'. Let's say the difference is x. Then count how many question marks exist. The number of '(' required is (question_mark_count + x)/2 and ')' required is the rest.\",\n    \"To ensure the full string is a correct parenthesis sequence, the total number of '(' and ')' must be equal. During the assignment of parentheses to '?', we should assign closing parentheses in a way that prevents the strict prefixes from becoming balanced, possibly by having more closing than opening ones at some point.\",\n    \"When assigning '(' or ')' to '?', you need to keep track of the balance (number of '(' - number of ')') at each step. Assign '(' until the point when adding ')' would make the balance of a prefix go below zero, since this would violate prefix constraint.\",\n    \"Check the sum and if it can't be correct parenthesis sequence return ':('. Also edge cases include cases where filling the remaining is impossible, which can also be detected before proceeding or at the last stage.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
