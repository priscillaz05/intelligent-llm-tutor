Also, if the string length is 1, and the string is '*', then the output is 1.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: A greedy approach works well. Replace the first and last '*' with 'x'. Then, from the first 'x', find the farthest '*' within k distance and replace it with 'x', and repeat until the last '*' is reached.\\n- Implementation Considerations: The find() and rfind() methods will be used to find the indexes of the first and last '*' characters.
