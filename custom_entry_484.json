On each turn, a player can remove either one coin or coins equal to some prime power (i.e. p^{x} coins, where p - prime number and x - positive integer). Game ends when the pile becomes empty. The player who can not make a move in his turn loses.\\n\\nChef plays first.

Chef will remove the only coin from the pile and will win the game.\\nExample case 2. Chef will remove all 8 coins from the pile and win the game.

The last player to make a move wins.\\n- Identifying Optimal Play: Assume both players will make the best possible moves to win. This is crucial for determining the outcome.\\n- Searching for a Pattern: Consider small values of N to identify a potential winning strategy for Chef or Misha. Determine if a pattern emerges that can be generalized for larger N.\\n- Connecting N and Game Outcome: Try to find a relationship between the initial number of coins N and the winner of the game. This relationship should hold for all valid values of N.\\n- Discovering the Modulo 6 Pattern: After testing different values, it's revealed that if N % 6 == 0, Misha wins; otherwise, Chef wins.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What constitutes a 'prime power,' and how does it affect the moves a player can make?\",\n    \"How does optimal play influence the outcome of the game, and why is this assumption important?\",\n    \"Is there a pattern that emerges when analyzing the game's outcome for small values of N?\",\n    \"How can you generalize the pattern discovered to determine the winner for larger values of N?\",\n    \"Given that the problem involves game theory, what potential mathematical or combinatorial properties might influence the solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A 'prime power' is a number that can be expressed as p^x, where p is a prime number and x is a positive integer. This limits the number of coins a player can remove on their turn, adding a constraint to the game.\",\n    \"Optimal play means that both players will always choose the move that maximizes their chances of winning. This assumption is critical because the winner can't be determined if players make random or suboptimal moves.\",\n    \"Yes, testing with small values of N (e.g., 1 to 10) reveals a repeating pattern in the winner of the game. This pattern suggests a mathematical relationship between N and the game's outcome.\",\n    \"The pattern can be generalized by finding a mathematical function or condition that determines the winner based on the value of N. The solution is N % 6, if the remainder is 0, Misha wins, otherwise Chef wins.\",\n    \"Since it is a game theory problem, the solution might rely on properties of nim-sums, combinatorial game theory or mathematical induction to prove some base cases.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
