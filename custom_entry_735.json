Recently his girl friend broke up with him and to overcome the pain of acute misery he decided to restrict himself to Eat-Sleep-Code life cycle. For N days he did nothing but eat, sleep and code.  \\n\\nA close friend of Roy kept an eye on him for last N days. For every single minute of the day, he kept track of Roy's actions and prepared a log file.  \\n\\nThe log file contains exactly N lines, each line contains a string of length 1440 ( i.e. number of minutes in 24 hours of the day).\\nThe string is made of characters E, S, and C only; representing Eat, Sleep and Code respectively.  i^th character of the string represents what Roy was doing during i^th minute of the day.  \\n\\nRoy's friend is now interested in finding out the maximum of longest coding streak of the day - X.\\nHe also wants to find the longest coding streak of N days - Y.\\nCoding streak means number of C's without any E or S in between.  \\n\\nSee sample test case for clarification.  \\n\\nInput:\\nFirst line of each file contains N - number of days.\\nFollowing N lines contains a string of exactly 1440 length representing his activity on that day.  \\n\\nOutput:\\nPrint X and Y separated by a space in a single line.  \\n\\nConstraints:\\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 365\\nString consists of characters E, S, and C only.\\nString length is exactly 1440.\\n\\nNote: The sample test case does not follow the given constraints on string length to avoid large data. It is meant only for explanation. We assure you that the hidden test files strictly follow the constraints.\\n\\nSAMPLE INPUT\\n4\\nSSSSEEEECCCCEECCCC\\nCCCCCSSSSEEECCCCSS\\nSSSSSEEESSCCCCCCCS\\nEESSSSCCCCCCSSEEEESAMPLE OUTPUT\\n7 9Explanation\\n\\nLongest coding streak for each day is as follows:\\nDay 1: 4\\nDay 2: 5\\nDay 3: 7\\nDay 4: 6\\nMaximum of these is 7, hence X is 7.  \\n\\nNow in order to find longest coding streak of the all days, we should also check if Roy continued his coding from previous days.\\nAs in the sample test case, Roy was coding for 4 minutes at the end of Day 1 and he continued to code till 5 more minutes on Day 2. Hence the longest coding streak is 4+5 equals 9. There is no any other coding streak larger than this. So the longest coding streak of all days is 9.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"# Read input from stdin and provide input before running code\\nimport re\\nn =int(input())\\n'''max=0\\nstr=''\\n'''\\nmaxx=0\\nstrr=''\\nwhile(n):\\n\\tn=n-1\\n\\ts=input()\\n\\tstrr=strr+s\\n\\tl=re.findall('C+',s)\\n\\tif(len(l)!=0):\\n\\t\\ttemp=len(max(l))\\n\\t\\tif(temp>maxx):\\n\\t\\t\\tmaxx=temp\\nl=re.findall('C+',strr)\\ntemp=0\\nif(len(l)!=0):\\n\\ttemp=len(max(l))\\nj=str(maxx)+' '+str(temp)\\t\\nprint(j)\\n\\n\\n#print 'Hello World!'\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the problem: The task is to find two values, X and Y. X is the maximum of the longest coding streaks for each day. Y is the overall longest coding streak across all days, considering the possibility of coding streaks spanning multiple days.\\n- Identifying potential pitfalls: Pay attention to edge cases like when there are no 'C's in the input strings. It is important to correctly handle the accumulation of the string across multiple days for finding the overall longest coding streak.\\n- Selecting an algorithmic strategy: Read the number of days N. Iterate through each day, read the activity string, calculate the longest coding streak for that day. Maintain a variable to store the maximum of these daily streaks. After processing all days, concatenate all activity strings and calculate the longest coding streak in the combined string. Finally, print the maximum daily streak and the overall streak.\\n- Implementing the solution: Use regular expressions to find all occurrences of consecutive 'C's. Compute the lengths of each occurrence and update the maximums accordingly.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you determine the longest coding streak for a single day, given the activity string?\",\n    \"What is the significance of considering coding streaks that span multiple days, and how does it affect the calculation of Y?\",\n    \"How can regular expressions be used to efficiently find the coding streaks within the activity strings?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases to consider during the processing of the input, and how should they be handled?\",\n    \"How do you manage the string concatenation process for all the days to find the overall longest coding streak Y?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"To determine the longest coding streak for a single day, I can use regular expressions to find all contiguous sequences of 'C' characters. Then, I can determine the length of each sequence and choose the longest one.\",\n    \"Coding streaks that span multiple days are important because the overall longest coding streak might not be contained within a single day's activity. I must concatenate all activity strings to consider these spanning streaks when calculating Y.\",\n    \"Regular expressions offer a concise way to locate and extract all the coding streaks in a string. By using a pattern like 'C+', I can find all sequences of one or more 'C' characters.\",\n    \"Edge cases include scenarios where there are no coding streaks (no 'C's) in the activity string. In such cases, the streak length is zero. Also, I should ensure that the combined string is correctly handled.\",\n    \"To find the overall longest coding streak, I will concatenate all the activity strings together. Then I can apply the same regular expression approach as with the individual days to determine the overall longest coding streak across all days.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
