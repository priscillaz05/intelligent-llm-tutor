The rules are cumulative, meaning each week's rules build upon the previous weeks'. The transformations involve letter replacements, removals, and additions, with specific conditions.\\n- Devising a Strategy: The problem can be tackled by iteratively applying the rules for each week. Regular expressions can be used to identify and replace patterns in the text.  The case of the original letters must be preserved.\\n- Implementing Week-Specific Rules: Each week's rules must be implemented in a separate function. This would make the code more modular and easier to test.\\n- Applying Rules Cumulatively: The rules need to be applied sequentially, from week 1 to the specified week. The output of each week's rules becomes the input for the next week's rules.\\n- Preserving Case Sensitivity: Since the case needs to be retained, the replacement logic should account for both upper and lowercase letters. If an uppercase letter is replaced, the corresponding replacement should also be in uppercase.\\n- Considering Edge Cases and Special Conditions: The problem includes edge cases such as preserving 2- and 3-letter words when removing trailing 'e', only applying 'ing' replacement at the end of words, and only applying 'sm' replacement at the beginning of words. These need to be handled specifically.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How should I approach handling case sensitivity when replacing letters?\",\n    \"How can regular expressions be used to implement the replacement rules efficiently?\",\n    \"How do I apply the rules cumulatively for each week?\",\n    \"What is the best way to handle edge cases and special conditions, such as removing trailing 'e' while preserving certain short words or applying replacements only at the beginning/end of words?\",\n    \"How can I structure the code to make it more modular and testable, especially considering the multiple weeks of rules?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"When replacing a letter, check if the original letter is uppercase or lowercase. If it's uppercase, convert the replacement to uppercase before substituting it into the text. This can be done using conditional statements or string methods like `.upper()`.\",\n    \"Regular expressions provide a concise way to match and replace patterns in strings. Use `re.sub()` to perform substitutions based on the regular expression pattern. For each week's rules, create a corresponding regular expression to identify the patterns to be replaced.\",\n    \"Apply the rules sequentially by iterating through the weeks. For each week, apply the corresponding replacement function to the text, and then update the text with the result. The updated text becomes the input for the next week's rules.\",\n    \"For removing trailing 'e' while preserving certain short words, use negative lookbehind assertions in the regular expression to ensure that the 'e' is not preceded by a 1- or 2-letter word boundary. For replacements at the beginning or end of words, use word boundary anchors (`\\\\b`) in the regular expression to match only at the desired positions.\",\n    \"Create separate functions for each week's rules. Each function takes the current text as input and returns the transformed text. This modular approach makes the code easier to test and maintain. Use a main function `siegfried` that takes the week number as input and iteratively applies the rules for each week up to the specified week.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
