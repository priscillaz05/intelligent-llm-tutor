Taro can't concentrate outside the study, so he always studies in the study.\\n\\nHowever, on this day, $ N $ of courier service to Taro arrived. $ i $ ($ 1 \\\\le i \\\\le N $) The arrival time of the third courier is $ a_i $. It is painful to have the delivery person wait at the front door, so Taro decided to be at the front door by the time the courier arrives. Due to the large size of the mansion, it takes $ M $ one way to move between the study and the entrance.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Taro wants to study for as long as possible. Find the maximum amount of time Taro can study in the study from time $ 0 $ to time $ T $.\\n\\nTaro is in the study at time $ 0 $, and the courier does not arrive earlier than the time $ M $, and the courier does not arrive later than the time $ T $. Also, the time it takes for Taro to receive the courier can be ignored.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nEach dataset consists of two lines. The first line consists of three integers $ N, M, T $ separated by blanks. These integers satisfy $ 1 \\\\le N \\\\le 100 $, $ 1 \\\\le M \\\\le 10 {,} 000 $, $ 1 \\\\le T \\\\le 10 {,} 000 $. The second line consists of $ N $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_N $ separated by blanks. Each $ a_i $ fills $ M \\\\le a_i \\\\le T $ and is also $ a_i <a_ {i + 1} $ ($ 1 \\\\le i <N $).\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nOutput an integer representing the maximum amount of time Taro can study on one line.\\n\\nSample Input 1\\n\\n\\n1 1 5\\n3\\n\\nOutput for the Sample Input 1\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\nSample Input 2\\n\\n\\n2 1 10\\n2 7\\n\\nOutput for the Sample Input 2\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\nSample Input 3\\n\\n\\n2 4 10\\n6 8\\n\\nOutput for the Sample Input 3\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExample\\n\\nInput\\n\\n1 1 5\\n3\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n3\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"l_raw = input().split()\\nl = [int(n) for n in l_raw]\\na_raw = input().split()\\na_ = [int(n) for n in a_raw]\\nstudy = 0\\nstate = 0\\nnow = 0\\nfor a in a_:\\n\\tif state == 0:\\n\\t\\tif l[1] < a - now:\\n\\t\\t\\tstudy += a - now - l[1]\\n\\t\\tnow = a\\n\\t\\tstate = 1\\n\\telif state == 1:\\n\\t\\tif 2 * l[1] < a - now:\\n\\t\\t\\tstudy += a - now - 2 * l[1]\\n\\t\\tnow = a\\nif l[2] - l[1] - a > 0:\\n\\tstudy += l[2] - l[1] - a\\nprint(study)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: Taro wants to maximize study time between courier arrivals, considering travel time M to the entrance. Taro starts studying at time 0 and must be at the door at each courier's arrival time. The last studying session ends M time units before time T.\\n- Identifying Constraints: N, M, T are positive integers. Arrival times are in ascending order. Travel time is constant.\\n- Edge Cases: Consider the initial study period before the first courier, intervals between couriers, and the final study period after the last courier's arrival.\\n- Algorithm Selection: Iterate through the courier arrival times and calculate the study time available between returning from the previous courier and needing to leave for the next. Total study time is the sum of these intervals plus the initial and final periods.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you calculate the study time before the first courier arrives, given the travel time M?\",\n    \"How do you determine the available study time between two consecutive courier arrival times, considering the round trip travel time (2*M)?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the final study period after handling all courier arrivals, considering that Taro must return to the study from the last delivery?\",\n    \"How would the 'state' variable in the ground truth solution affect the algorithm?\",\n    \"How should I initialize the 'now' variable to represent the current time?\",\n    \"How to handle the edge case where the list of couriers is empty?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The study time before the first courier is the courier's arrival time minus the travel time: a[0] - M. If a[0] <= M, the initial study time is 0.\",\n    \"The available study time between two consecutive arrival times is calculated as follows: If a[i+1] - a[i] > 2*M, then study time += a[i+1] - a[i] - 2*M. Otherwise, no additional study time is added between these two deliveries.\",\n    \"The final study time can be calculated by subtracting the travel time M from the final time T and comparing it with the last courier's arrival time: study time += max(0, T - M - a[N-1]).\",\n    \"The 'state' variable seems to track if it is the first courier. It doesn't affect the algorithm. It can be simplified by calculating the study time based on a single parameter\",\n    \"Initialize 'now' to 0 to represent the starting time at the study.\",\n    \"If there are no couriers, the entire time T - M can be spent studying. Therefore return T - M\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
