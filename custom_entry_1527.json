The network consists of water pipe segments, stop valves and source point. A water pipe is represented by a segment on a 2D-plane and intersected pair of water pipe segments are connected at the intersection point. A stop valve, which prevents from water flowing into the repairing point while repairing, is represented by a point on some water pipe segment. In the network, just one source point exists and water is supplied to the network from this point.\\n\\nOf course, while repairing, we have to stop water supply in some areas, but, in order to reduce the risk of riots, the length of water pipes stopping water supply must be minimized. What you have to do is to write a program to minimize the length of water pipes needed to stop water supply when the coordinates of end points of water pipe segments, stop valves, source point and repairing point are given.\\n\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\nA data set has the following format:\\n\\n> N M\\n>  xs1 ys1 xd1 yd1\\n>  ...\\n>  xsN ysN xdN ydN\\n>  xv1 yv1\\n>  ...\\n>  xvM yvM\\n>  xb yb\\n>  xc yc\\n>\\n\\nThe first line of the input contains two integers, N (1 \u2264 N \u2264 300) and M (0 \u2264 M \u2264 1,000) that indicate the number of water pipe segments and stop valves. The following N lines describe the end points of water pipe segments. The i-th line contains four integers, xsi, ysi, xdi and ydi that indicate the pair of coordinates of end points of i-th water pipe segment. The following M lines describe the points of stop valves. The i-th line contains two integers, xvi and yvi that indicate the coordinate of end points of i-th stop valve. The following line contains two integers, xb and yb that indicate the coordinate of the source point. The last line contains two integers, xc and yc that indicate the coordinate of the repairing point.\\n\\nYou may assume that any absolute values of coordinate integers are less than 1,000 (inclusive.) You may also assume each of the stop valves, the source point and the repairing point is always on one of water pipe segments and that that each pair among the stop valves, the source point and the repairing point are different. And, there is not more than one intersection between each pair of water pipe segments. Finally, the water pipe network is connected, that is, all the water pipes are received water supply initially.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nPrint the minimal length of water pipes needed to stop water supply in a line. The absolute or relative error should be less than or 10-6. When you cannot stop water supply to the repairing point even though you close all stop valves, print \\\"`-1`\\\" in a line.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nInput\\n\\n1 2\\n0 0 10 0\\n1 0\\n9 0\\n0 0\\n5 0\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n9.0\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n5 3\\n0 4 2 4\\n0 2 2 2\\n0 0 2 0\\n0 0 0 4\\n2 0 2 4\\n0 2\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n1 4\\n2 1\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n3.0\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n2 1\\n0 0 0 4\\n0 2 2 2\\n1 2\\n0 1\\n0 3\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n-1\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"from collections import deque\\nimport sys\\nreadline = sys.stdin.readline\\nwrite = sys.stdout.write\\n\\ndef dot3(O, A, B):\\n\\t(ox, oy) = O\\n\\t(ax, ay) = A\\n\\t(bx, by) = B\\n\\treturn (ax - ox) * (bx - ox) + (ay - oy) * (by - oy)\\n\\ndef cross3(O, A, B):\\n\\t(ox, oy) = O\\n\\t(ax, ay) = A\\n\\t(bx, by) = B\\n\\treturn (ax - ox) * (by - oy) - (bx - ox) * (ay - oy)\\n\\ndef dist2(A, B):\\n\\t(ax, ay) = A\\n\\t(bx, by) = B\\n\\treturn (ax - bx) ** 2 + (ay - by) ** 2\\n\\ndef is_intersection(L1, L2):\\n\\tP0 = L1[:2]\\n\\tP1 = L1[2:]\\n\\tQ0 = L2[:2]\\n\\tQ1 = L2[2:]\\n\\tC0 = cross3(P0, P1, Q0)\\n\\tC1 = cross3(P0, P1, Q1)\\n\\tD0 = cross3(Q0, Q1, P0)\\n\\tD1 = cross3(Q0, Q1, P1)\\n\\tif C0 == C1 == 0:\\n\\t\\treturn False\\n\\treturn C0 * C1 <= 0 and D0 * D1 <= 0\\n\\ndef cross_point(L1, L2):\\n\\t(x0, y0, x1, y1) = L1\\n\\t(x2, y2, x3, y3) = L2\\n\\tdx0 = x1 - x0\\n\\tdy0 = y1 - y0\\n\\tdx1 = x3 - x2\\n\\tdy1 = y3 - y2\\n\\ts = (y0 - y2) * dx1 - (x0 - x2) * dy1\\n\\tsm = dx0 * dy1 - dy0 * dx1\\n\\tif s < 0:\\n\\t\\ts = -s\\n\\t\\tsm = -sm\\n\\tif s == 0:\\n\\t\\tx = x0\\n\\t\\ty = y0\\n\\telif s == sm:\\n\\t\\tx = x1\\n\\t\\ty = y1\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tx = x0 + s * dx0 / sm\\n\\t\\ty = y0 + s * dy0 / sm\\n\\treturn (x, y)\\n\\ndef solve():\\n\\t(N, M) = map(int, readline().split())\\n\\tps = set()\\n\\tmp = {}\\n\\tLS = []\\n\\tfor i in range(N):\\n\\t\\t(x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, readline().split())\\n\\t\\tmp[x1, y1] = 0\\n\\t\\tmp[x2, y2] = 0\\n\\t\\tLS.append((x1, y1, x2, y2))\\n\\tfor i in range(N):\\n\\t\\tL1 = LS[i]\\n\\t\\tfor j in range(i + 1, N):\\n\\t\\t\\tL2 = LS[j]\\n\\t\\t\\tif is_intersection(L1, L2):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(x, y) = cross_point(L1, L2)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmp[x, y] = 0\\n\\tfor i in range(M):\\n\\t\\t(x, y) = map(int, readline().split())\\n\\t\\tmp[x, y] = 1\\n\\t(xb, yb) = map(int, readline().split())\\n\\tmp[xb, yb] = 2\\n\\t(xc, yc) = map(int, readline().split())\\n\\tmp[xc, yc] = 2\\n\\t(*ps1,) = mp.keys()\\n\\tps1.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))\\n\\tmv = {e: i for (i, e) in enumerate(ps1)}\\n\\t(*ps2,) = mp.keys()\\n\\tps2.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))\\n\\tES = []\\n\\tms = list(map(mv.__getitem__, ps2))\\n\\tks = list(map(mp.__getitem__, ps1))\\n\\tK = len(ps1)\\n\\tG = [[] for i in range(K)]\\n\\tfor (x1, y1, x2, y2) in LS:\\n\\t\\tvs = []\\n\\t\\tif x1 != x2:\\n\\t\\t\\tif not x1 <= x2:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(x1, y1, x2, y2) = (x2, y2, x1, y1)\\n\\t\\t\\tfor (k, (x, y)) in enumerate(ps1):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif x1 <= x <= x2 and abs((x - x1) * (y2 - y1) - (y - y1) * (x2 - x1)) < 1e-06:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tvs.append(k)\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tif not y1 <= y2:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(y1, y2) = (y2, y1)\\n\\t\\t\\tfor (k, (x, y)) in zip(ms, ps2):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif y1 <= y <= y2 and abs((x - x1) * (y2 - y1) - (y - y1) * (x2 - x1)) < 1e-06:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tvs.append(k)\\n\\t\\tfor i in range(len(vs) - 1):\\n\\t\\t\\tk1 = vs[i]\\n\\t\\t\\tk2 = vs[i + 1]\\n\\t\\t\\tG[k1].append(k2)\\n\\t\\t\\tG[k2].append(k1)\\n\\t\\t\\tES.append((k1, k2) if k1 <= k2 else (k2, k1))\\n\\ts = mv[xc, yc]\\n\\tt = mv[xb, yb]\\n\\tque = deque([s])\\n\\tused = [0] * K\\n\\tused[s] = 1\\n\\te_used = set()\\n\\twhile que:\\n\\t\\tv = que.popleft()\\n\\t\\tfor w in G[v]:\\n\\t\\t\\tif w == t:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twrite('-1\\\\n')\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn\\n\\t\\t\\te_used.add((v, w) if v <= w else (w, v))\\n\\t\\t\\tif not used[w] and ks[w] != 1:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tque.append(w)\\n\\t\\t\\tused[w] = 1\\n\\tque.append(t)\\n\\te_used1 = set()\\n\\tused = [0] * K\\n\\tused[t] = 1\\n\\twhile que:\\n\\t\\tv = que.popleft()\\n\\t\\tfor w in G[v]:\\n\\t\\t\\te = (v, w) if v <= w else (w, v)\\n\\t\\t\\tif e in e_used:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontinue\\n\\t\\t\\te_used1.add(e)\\n\\t\\t\\tif not used[w]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tque.append(w)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tused[w] = 1\\n\\tans = 0\\n\\tfor (k1, k2) in ES:\\n\\t\\tif (k1, k2) in e_used1:\\n\\t\\t\\tcontinue\\n\\t\\t(x1, y1) = ps1[k1]\\n\\t\\t(x2, y2) = ps1[k2]\\n\\t\\tans += ((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2) ** 0.5\\n\\twrite('%.16f\\\\n' % ans)\\nsolve()\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem describes a water pipe network on a 2D plane with pipes as segments, valves as points on the segments, a source, and a repair point. The objective is to find the minimum length of pipes to shut off to isolate the repair point from the source, considering stop valves.\\n- Data Structures and Graph Representation: The pipe network can be modeled as a graph where intersection points and endpoints of pipes are nodes and pipes between these points are edges. Stop valves act as potential barriers in this network.\\n- Algorithm Selection: Dijkstra's or BFS-based algorithms can be adapted to find the shortest path from the source to the repair point, considering the stop valves as obstacles. The goal is to find the minimum length of pipes to remove such that no path exists between the source and repair points without passing through open pipes.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: The problem statement allows for the possibility that the repair point cannot be isolated even with all valves closed, requiring the output of -1. Additionally, floating-point precision must be considered when dealing with intersection and distance calculations.\\n- Implementation Details: Key aspects are the correct implementation of line intersection, point-on-segment checks, graph creation, and shortest path calculation. Floating-point comparison with tolerance is essential.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can the pipe network be represented as a graph, and what do nodes and edges signify in this context?\",\n    \"What algorithm can be used to find the shortest path or connectivity between the source and repair points in the graph?\",\n    \"How do the stop valves influence the algorithm and graph connectivity, and what actions are required to account for them?\",\n    \"What edge cases should be considered, such as the repair point being unreachable, and how are they handled in the code?\",\n    \"How can floating-point precision issues be managed when calculating distances and detecting intersections?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The pipe network can be represented as a graph where the nodes are the endpoints of the pipes, intersection points of pipes, stop valves, source and repair points.
