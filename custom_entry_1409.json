"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"Thumbelina has had an accident. She has found herself on a little island in the middle of a swamp and wants to get to the shore very much.\\n\\nOne can get to the shore only by hills that are situated along a straight line that connects the little island with the shore. Let us assume that the hills are numbered from 1 to n and the number of a hill is equal to the distance in meters between it and the island. The distance between the n-th hill and the shore is also 1 meter.\\n\\nThumbelina is too small to make such jumps. Fortunately, a family of frogs living in the swamp suggests to help her. Each frog agrees to give Thumbelina a ride but Thumbelina should choose only one frog. Each frog has a certain jump length. If Thumbelina agrees to accept help from a frog whose jump length is d, the frog will jump from the island on the hill d, then \u2014 on the hill 2d, then 3d and so on until they get to the shore (i.e. find itself beyond the hill n).\\n\\nHowever, there is one more problem: mosquitoes also live in the swamp. At the moment they have a siesta, and they are having a nap on some hills. If the frog jumps on a hill with a mosquito the frog will smash it. The frogs Thumbelina has met are pacifists, so they will find the death of each mosquito very much sad. Help Thumbelina choose a frog that will bring her to the shore and smash as small number of mosquitoes as possible.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line contains three integers n, m and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 109, 1 \u2264 m, k \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of hills, frogs and mosquitoes respectively. The second line contains m integers di (1 \u2264 di \u2264 109) \u2014 the lengths of the frogs\u2019 jumps. The third line contains k integers \u2014 the numbers of the hills on which each mosquito is sleeping. No more than one mosquito can sleep on each hill. The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nIn the first line output the number of frogs that smash the minimal number of mosquitoes, in the second line \u2014 their numbers in increasing order separated by spaces.\\n The frogs are numbered from 1 to m in the order of the jump length given in the input data.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nInput\\n\\n5 3 5\\n2 3 4\\n1 2 3 4 5\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n2\\n2 3\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n1000000000 2 3\\n2 5\\n999999995 999999998 999999996\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n1\\n2\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())\\n(x, y) = (n, [])\\na = map(int, input().split())\\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\\nfor (i, d) in enumerate(a):\\n\\tc = 0\\n\\tfor t in b:\\n\\t\\tif 0 == t % d:\\n\\t\\t\\tc += 1\\n\\tif c < x:\\n\\t\\tx = c\\n\\t\\ty = [i + 1]\\n\\telif c == x:\\n\\t\\ty += (i + 1,)\\nprint(len(y))\\nprint(' '.join(map(str, y)))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understand the problem: The problem asks to find the frogs that smash the minimum number of mosquitoes.\\n- Input parsing: Read the input values for n, m, k, the frog jump lengths, and the mosquito locations.\\n- Iterate through frogs: Iterate through each frog and calculate the number of mosquitoes it would smash.\\n- Calculate mosquitoes smashed: For each frog, iterate through the mosquito locations and check if the frog would land on that hill (i.e., if the mosquito location is divisible by the frog's jump length).\\n- Track minimum mosquitoes smashed: Keep track of the minimum number of mosquitoes smashed so far and the indices of the frogs that achieve this minimum.\\n- Output: Print the number of frogs that smash the minimum number of mosquitoes and their indices in increasing order.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you determine if a frog will land on a mosquito's hill?\",\n    \"How do you keep track of the frogs that smash the minimum number of mosquitoes?\",\n    \"What data structures are most suitable for storing frog jump lengths and mosquito locations?\",\n    \"How do you handle the case where multiple frogs smash the same minimum number of mosquitoes?\",\n    \"Given that 'n' can be up to 10^9, is there a way to avoid calculating all hills the frog jumps to and instead calculate directly if a mosquito will be hit?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A frog will land on a mosquito's hill if the mosquito's hill number is perfectly divisible by the frog's jump length.\",\n    \"You can maintain a variable to store the current minimum number of mosquitoes smashed and a list to store the indices of the frogs that achieve this minimum.
