Instead, an approach involving tracking the smallest and second smallest numbers seen so far while iterating through the array would satisfy the complexity constraints.\\n- Implementing the Optimal Solution: Initialize variables to track the minimum and second minimum values encountered. As the array is traversed, update these variables if a smaller value is found. If a number greater than both the minimum and second minimum is encountered, it indicates an increasing triplet has been found.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for a sequence to be strictly increasing, and how does this constraint affect your approach to finding the triplet?\",\n    \"Given the constraints of O(n) time and O(1) space complexity, can you use sorting algorithms or other data structures that might require more space?\",\n    \"If you encounter a number smaller than both your current minimum and second minimum, how should you update your tracking variables?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently determine that an increasing triplet has been found without iterating through all possible combinations?\",\n    \"How does your algorithm handle edge cases such as an empty array or an array with fewer than three elements?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A strictly increasing sequence means each number must be greater than the one before it.
