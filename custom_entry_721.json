At the same time, array $[1, 2, 1, 3]$ isn't good, as $1 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 7 \\\\neq 2\\\\cdot 1 = 2\\\\cdot(1\\\\oplus 2 \\\\oplus 1 \\\\oplus 3)$.\\n\\nYou are given an array of length $n$: $a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$. Append at most $3$ elements to it to make it good. Appended elements don't have to be different. It can be shown that the solution always exists under the given constraints. If there are different solutions, you are allowed to output any of them. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of added elements! So, if an array is good already you are allowed to not append elements.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

If not, we need to append up to 3 elements to make it 'good'.\\n- Formulating the Condition: The array is 'good' if the sum of its elements equals twice their XOR. If sum == 2 * XOR, we output 0.\\n- Handling Non-Good Arrays: If sum != 2 * XOR, we need to append elements. The key is to find the right numbers to append such that the modified array becomes 'good'. The solution always exists with at most 3 appended numbers.\\n- Solution Strategy: The ground truth solution uses the property that adding 'xor' and 'sum' to the array will make the equation valid. If the initial sum is less than 2 * xor and the differece between 2 * xor and sum is even, add two equal values equal to (2 * xor - sum) / 2. Otherwise append 3 values, first a large value, then 2 values to correct sum and xor.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How is 'good' array defined in the problem statement?\",\n    \"What should be the output if the given array is already 'good'?\",\n    \"What is the maximum number of elements you can append to the array?\",\n    \"What if sum is less than 2*xor and the difference is odd, what should you do?\",\n    \"What if the sum is greater than 2*xor, what approach you can take?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"An array is considered 'good' if the sum of its elements equals twice the XOR of its elements.\",\n    \"If the array is already 'good', you should output 0.\",\n    \"You can append at most 3 elements to the array.\",\n    \"We should add another value to make the difference even.\",\n    \"You need to append elements such that the sum and xor of the new array satisfies the condition.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
