It's important to include the end value, so the range's upper bound must be the second input plus one. Using the `list` function will convert the range object to a list.\\n- Implementation Details: `range(m, n+1)` generates integers from m to n (inclusive). Wrapping it with `list()` transforms it into a list.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What library function in Python is most suitable for generating a sequence of numbers, and how can we ensure it includes the upper bound?\",\n    \"Why do we need to add `1` to the second input when using the `range` function?\",\n    \"How do we convert the output of the `range` function into a list?\",\n    \"What are the potential edge cases to consider, and how does this solution handle them?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The `range` function is best for generating a sequence of numbers. To include the upper bound, we need to provide `n + 1` as the second argument to `range`.\",\n    \"The `range` function in Python generates a sequence of numbers up to, but not including, the specified end value.
