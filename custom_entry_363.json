More formally, we investigate the sum of n components denoted by d(1) + d(2) + ... + d(n) in which for any i starting from 1 up to n the value of d(i) tells us how many distinct numbers divide i without a remainder. \\n\\nYour solution should work for possibly large values of n without a timeout.\\nAssume n to be greater than zero and not greater than 999 999 999 999 999.\\nBrute force approaches will not be feasible options in such cases. It is fairly simple to conclude that for every n>1 there holds a recurrence S(n) = S(n-1) + d(n) with initial case S(1) = 1.\\n\\nFor example:\\nS(1) = 1\\nS(2) = 3\\nS(3) = 5\\nS(4) = 8\\nS(5) = 10\\n\\nBut is the fact useful anyway? If you find it is rather not, maybe this will help: \\n\\nTry to convince yourself that for any natural k, the number S(k) is the same as the number of pairs (m,n) that solve the inequality mn <= k in natural numbers.\\nOnce it becomes clear, we can think of a partition of all the solutions into classes just by saying that a pair (m,n) belongs to the class indexed by n.\\nThe question now arises if it is possible to count solutions of n-th class. If f(n) stands for the number of solutions that belong to n-th class, it means that S(k) = f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + ...\\n\\nThe reasoning presented above leads us to some kind of a formula for S(k), however not necessarily the most efficient one. Can you imagine that all the solutions to inequality mn <= k can be split using sqrt(k) as pivotal item?\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def count_divisors(n):\\n\\tr = int(n ** (1 / 2))\\n\\treturn 2 * sum((n // i for i in range(1, r + 1))) - r * r\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The task is to compute the sum S(n), where S(n) is the sum of the number of divisors of each number from 1 to n.\\n- Recognizing Inefficiencies: Brute-force approaches (iterating through each number from 1 to n and counting its divisors) are not feasible for large n due to potential timeouts.\\n- Leveraging the Insight: The sum S(k) is equivalent to the number of pairs (m, n) such that mn <= k.\\n- Optimizing the Counting: Split the pairs based on whether n <= sqrt(k) or n > sqrt(k) to create a more efficient algorithm. Using the value of sqrt(k) as a split point is critical for reducing computation complexity.\\n- Implementing the Optimization: For n <= sqrt(k), iterate through n from 1 to floor(sqrt(k)).
