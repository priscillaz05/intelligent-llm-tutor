The Little Elephant from the Zoo of Lviv is not an exception.\\n\\nThe Little Elephant is on a board A of n rows and m columns (0-based numeration). At the beginning he is in cell with coordinates (0; 0) and he wants to go to cell with coordinates (n-1; m-1). From cell (x; y) Little Elephant can go either to (x+1; y) or (x; y+1).\\n\\nEach cell of the board contains either 1 or 0. If A[i][j] = 1, then there is a single mouse in cell (i; j). Mouse at cell (i; j) scared Little Elephants if and only if during the path there was at least one such cell (x; y) (which belongs to that path) and |i-x| + |j-y| <= 1.\\n\\nLittle Elephant wants to find some correct path from (0; 0) to (n-1; m-1) such that the number of mouses that have scared the Little Elephant is minimal possible. Print that number.\\n\\n-----Input-----\\nFirst line contains single integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

A mouse is scared if it is within a Manhattan distance of 1 from any cell on the path.\\n- Identifying Constraints: We can only move right or down. The grid cells contain either 0 or 1 representing the presence of a mouse.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: Use dynamic programming to find the minimum number of scared mice. The state can be represented as dp[i][j][k], where (i, j) is the current cell, and k represents the direction from which we arrived (0 for left, 1 for up).  `shadow[i][j]` will store the number of mice scared at position `(i, j)` based on mice one step away from `(i,j)`.\\n- Initialization: Initialize the dp table for the starting cell (0, 0). dp[0][0][0] = dp[0][0][1] = shadow[0][0] - mouse[0][0].\\n- Recurrence Relation: For each cell (i, j), calculate the minimum scared mice by considering the two possible paths to reach that cell. Handle the special case where we move from the top or left to cell i, j. We need to compute shadow effects. `dp[i, j, 0] = a` and `dp[i, j, 1] = b` where `a` and `b` are the minimum number of scared mice considering from left and from above, respectively. The mouse at `(i-1, j)` can scare mouse at `(i, j)` (similarly the mouse at `(i, j-1)` can scare the mouse at `(i, j)`.\\n- Result: The final answer will be the minimum of `dp[n-1][m-1][0]` and `dp[n-1][m-1][1]` plus the mice present at start and end position.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does the problem define when a mouse is scared, and what does Manhattan distance have to do with it?\",\n    \"What constraints are imposed on the path taken by the Little Elephant, and how do these constraints affect the possible solutions?\",\n    \"Can you explain the shadow array calculation in details.\",\n    \"Explain the meaning of the state dp[i][j][k] in the dynamic programming approach and how it relates to the problem's objective.\",\n    \"How is the base case or initial state set up in the dynamic programming solution, and why is it initialized that way?\",\n    \"Can you walk through the recurrence relation used in the dynamic programming algorithm, explaining how the minimum number of scared mice is calculated at each step.\",\n    \"What edge cases should be considered when implementing the dynamic programming solution, and how can these cases be handled?\",\n    \"Explain how the final answer is determined once the dynamic programming table is filled, and why it provides the correct solution.\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A mouse at cell (i, j) is scared if there's a cell (x, y) on the elephant's path such that the Manhattan distance |i-x| + |j-y| is less than or equal to 1.\",\n    \"The Little Elephant can only move right (x, y+1) or down (x+1, y). This limits the possible paths and simplifies the problem to finding the minimum cost path in a grid.\",\n    \"The shadow array indicates the total number of mice that are scared because of the neighboring cells that has the mouse. If mouse at (i,j) = 1, then all the neighbor cells (i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), and (i, j+1) will be scared.\",\n    \"dp[i][j][k] represents the minimum number of scared mice to reach cell (i, j) from (0, 0), where k indicates the direction from which we arrived (0 for left, 1 for up). This allows us to keep track of potentially different scared mice counts based on the approach direction.\",\n    \"The base case is set as dp[0][0][0] = dp[0][0][1] = shadow[0][0] - mouse[0][0] because at the starting cell (0, 0), the number of scared mice depends on whether neighboring cells have mice.  We substract mouse[0][0] to avoid double counting.\",\n    \"The recurrence relation calculates the minimum scared mice count by considering the minimum of the paths arriving from the left and from above and adds the cost of current cell in terms of scared mice.  For example, `a += min(dp[i, j - 1, 0], dp[i, j - 1, 1] - mouse[i - 1][j])` considers if a mouse at `(i-1,j)` is already scaring the mouse at `(i, j)`.  Similar calculation for coming from the top. Finally `dp[i, j, 0] = a` and `dp[i, j, 1] = b`.\",\n    \"Edge cases include when n or m is 1 (only one row or column), which simplifies the path. It is also important to initialize the first row and column of the dp table correctly to propagate the scared mice counts accurately.  Also, need to consider when some `mouse[i][j]` are zero.\",\n    \"The final answer is the minimum of `dp[n-1][m-1][0]` and `dp[n-1][m-1][1]` plus the mice present at `mouse[0][0]` and `mouse[n-1][m-1]`. It represents the minimum scared mice count to reach the destination cell (n-1, m-1) from either direction and adding the mice that are already there at start and end positions.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
