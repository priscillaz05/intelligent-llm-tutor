The program needs to output this optimal X and the minimized bitwise OR value.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: The constraints mention A_i can be up to 10^9. Direct brute force by trying every possible X up to 10^9 may result in exceeding time limit. The maximum value of X to consider needs to be carefully selected.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Consider a possible optimal X is the maximum element within the input array. Try that X and return its result alongside the X value itself.\\n- Implementation Considerations: The bitwise XOR operator in python is `^`, and the bitwise OR operator is `|`.
