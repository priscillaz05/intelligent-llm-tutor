The starting number goes from K down to 0, then up to K again.\\n- Copying and Reversing: After reaching the middle row (starting with 0), construct the rest of the pattern by reversing the rows from before and combining. Notice the need to omit the central element while reconstructing the lower part.\\n- Handling Spaces: Account for spaces at the beginning of each string based on the index.\\n- Print Each Line: Print out each line of the generated pattern.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How should the pattern increase and decrease in terms of starting numbers?\",\n    \"What is the logic for constructing the top half of the pattern, and how does it change to form the bottom half?\",\n    \"How do you account for spaces at the beginning of each row?\",\n    \"How do you handle the transition from the top half of the pattern to the bottom half without duplicating the central row?\",\n    \"Given a K value, what would the central element of the pattern be, and how does it relate to the other elements around it?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The starting numbers decrease to 0 and then increase back to K. Each row contains numbers from the start number to K.\",\n    \"The top half begins at K and goes down until 0; each line includes numbers from the starting index to K. The bottom half reverses the process.\",\n    \"Spaces should correspond to the decreasing start value to offset the pattern so the number ascends to K, for each line\",\n    \"After creating the top half, exclude the central row (the row that starts with 0) when reversing and appending to create the bottom half of the pattern.\",\n    \"The central element starts with 0 and increases by 1 up to K. All other starting elements ascend up to K\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
