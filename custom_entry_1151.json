Iterate through the grouped elements, and for each group, count the number of elements in that group and return a tuple of the element and its count.\\n- Edge Cases: No specific edge cases besides iterable input. `groupby` handles empty sequences gracefully.\\n- Implementing the Solution: Leverage the `groupby` function to do the heavy lifting of grouping elements and then uses sum to add up the count of elements in each group.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does the `groupby` function from the `itertools` module work, and why is it suitable for this problem?\",\n    \"What would happen if the input sequence were empty?\",\n    \"How can the number of items in each group returned by `groupby` be counted?\",\n    \"What data structure should be used to return the output of this function, given the problem statement?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"`groupby` groups consecutive identical items in an iterable. It returns consecutive keys and groups from the iterable. It's suitable because the problem requires counting consecutive duplicates. The key is the element itself.\",\n    \"If the input sequence is empty, `groupby` will return an empty iterator, and the function will return an empty list, which is a correct behavior.\",\n    \"The number of items in each group can be counted by iterating through the group and incrementing a counter or by using the `sum` function with a generator expression.\",\n    \"The problem asks for a sequence of tuples. Each tuple contains the element and its count. A list of tuples is a good data structure to return.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
