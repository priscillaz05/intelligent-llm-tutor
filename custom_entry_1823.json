He looks at every subarray of length $K$, and writes its sum on a piece of paper. If a number appears as the sum of multiple subarrays of length $K$, then he only writes down that number once.\\n\\nChef is lazy and doesn't like to write numbers. You, being a friend of Chef, want to modify the array such that Chef will only write one number on his paper. In one modification you can choose any index $i$ and replace $A_{i}$ with any integer.\\n\\nYou need to find the minimum number of modifications required.\\n\\n------ Input ------\\nThe first line contains an integer $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\\nEach test case contains two lines of input.\\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers $N$, $K$.\\nThe second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\\\ldots, A_{N}$.\\n\\n------ Output ------\\nFor each test case, output the answer in a single line.\\n\\n------ Constraints ------\\n$1 \\\\leq T \\\\leq 1000$\\n$1 \\\\leq N \\\\leq 10^{5}$\\n$1 \\\\leq K \\\\leq N$\\n$1 \\\\leq A_{i} \\\\leq 10^{5}$\\nThe sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5\\\\cdot 10^{5}$.\\n\\n----- Sample Input 1 ------ \\n2\\n\\n3 3 \\n\\n1 2 3\\n\\n2 1\\n\\n4 6\\n----- Sample Output 1 ------ \\n0\\n\\n1\\n----- explanation 1 ------ \\nTest Case 1: $K=3$ and there is only one subarray of length $3$, so no changes are required.\\n\\nTest Case 2: $K=1$ and the subarrays of length $1$ are $[4]$ and $[6]$. So, at least one modification is required. One possible solution with only one modification is to change $A_{2}$ to $4$.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"for _ in range(int(input())):\\n\\t(n, k) = map(int, input().split())\\n\\tt = list(map(int, input().split()))\\n\\tans = 0\\n\\tfor i in range(k):\\n\\t\\td = {}\\n\\t\\tq = i\\n\\t\\twhile q < n:\\n\\t\\t\\tif t[q] not in d:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\td[t[q]] = 1\\n\\t\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\td[t[q]] += 1\\n\\t\\t\\tq += k\\n\\t\\tl = list(d.values())\\n\\t\\ts = sum(l)\\n\\t\\tmx = max(l)\\n\\t\\tans += s - mx\\n\\tprint(ans)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding Problem Constraints: The problem requires minimizing the number of modifications to an array A such that all subarrays of length K have the same sum. A modification involves changing a single element of A to any integer.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: The naive approach of comparing all subarray sums would be inefficient due to the large input size. The constraint $1 \\\\leq N \\\\leq 10^{5}$ suggests that we should strive for $O(N)$ or $O(N log N)$ time complexity.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: The problem can be approached by observing that if all subarray sums are the same, then elements at index i, i+K, i+2K... must eventually be the same after some modifications. We iterate through the first K indices and for each index i, we count the frequency of each number in the subsequence i, i+K, i+2K.... Then we change the elements of the subsequence so all elements have the value of the most frequent element.\\n- Implementing Optimizations: Use a dictionary to efficiently keep track of the frequency of the different values within each subsequence. Calculate the number of modifications by summing all frequencies and subtracting the maximum frequency.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does changing an element in array A affect the sums of subarrays containing that element?\",\n    \"How do you efficiently compute subarray sums without incurring a large time complexity?\",\n    \"If you make all elements in a specific subsequence equal, how does this relate to obtaining the same sum for all subarrays of length K?\",\n    \"How do you determine the minimum number of modifications needed to ensure all elements in the subsequence are equal?\",\n    \"What data structures can you employ to efficiently determine the most frequent element within a subsequence?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Changing an element affects all subarrays that contain that element, so it can be used to control the sums of those subarrays.\",\n    \"Instead of directly calculating subarray sums, focus on ensuring specific elements in A are equal. This simplifies the problem and avoids redundant calculations.\",\n    \"If all elements in each subsequence (i, i+K, i+2K...) are the same, then all subarrays will have equal sums, since the sums will be equivalent modulo the first K elements.\",\n    \"Determine the most frequent value in the subsequence and change all other values to this most frequent value.
