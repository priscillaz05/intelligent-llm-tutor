Gru went to the planet of minions to recruit minions, he saw that there are two villages separated by a river. He cannot recruit minions from both villages because then his team will have internal conflicts. \\n\\nGru is now in a dilemma about which village to recruit as he wants to have the strongest possible team.\\n\\nYou are given coordinates of houses on the planet. Each house has exactly one minion and his power is given. The planet of minion is considered as a 2-D plane and the river is denoted by a straight line ( $y=mx+c$ ). \\n$Note:$ None of the houses are situated on the river.\\n\\n------ Input: ------\\n\\nFirst-line will contain $N$, number of houses. \\nSecond-line will contain two integers, $m$ and $c$ denoting the river.\\nNext $N$ lines will have exactly 3 integers $X[i], Y[i], P[i]$ denoting the coordinates of houses and the power of minion in that house \\n\\n------ Output: ------\\nPrint the maximum power of the team which Gru can recruit.\\n\\n------ Constraints  ------\\n$1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^{5}$\\n$-10^{4} \u2264 m,c \u2264 10^{4}$\\n$-10^{4} \u2264 X[i], Y[i] \u2264 10^{4}$\\n$ 1 \u2264 P[i] \u2264 10^{4}$\\n\\n----- Sample Input 1 ------ \\n3\\n1 0\\n0 5 5\\n0 6 5\\n0 -8 20\\n----- Sample Output 1 ------ \\n20\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"n = int(input())\\n(m, c) = map(int, input().split())\\n(a, b) = (0, 0)\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\t(x, y, p) = map(int, input().split())\\n\\tif m * x + c < y:\\n\\t\\ta = a + p\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tb = b + p\\nprint(max(a, b))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires determining the maximum possible power of minions Gru can recruit from either of the two villages separated by a river (a line $y = mx + c$). Gru can only recruit from one village.\\n- Deciding Village Affiliation: For each house (minion), determine which side of the river it lies on. This can be done by checking if the y-coordinate of the house is greater than or less than the value of $mx + c$ at the house's x-coordinate.\\n- Calculating Total Power: Calculate the total power of minions on each side of the river.\\n- Returning the Maximum Power: Return the maximum of the two sums, representing the maximum power Gru can obtain.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you determine which side of the river a house is located on, given its coordinates (X[i], Y[i]) and the river's equation (y = mx + c)?\",\n    \"How do you handle the input efficiently, especially considering the constraint $1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^{5}$?\",\n    \"What is the purpose of initializing two separate variables (a and b) and how are they updated throughout the code?\",\n    \"Why is it important to read the input values for m, c, x, y, and p as integers? \",\n    \"How would the logic need to change if the problem allowed minions on the river?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Compare Y[i] with (m * X[i] + c). If Y[i] > (m * X[i] + c), the house is on one side; otherwise, it's on the other side.  The problem statement specifies no houses are *on* the river.\",\n    \"Read the input line by line, using `input()` and `map(int, input().split())` to parse the values into integers. Using a loop to iterate through each house is efficient for $N \u2264 10^{5}$.\",\n    \"Variables 'a' and 'b' are initialized to 0. 'a' accumulates the total power of minions on one side of the river, and 'b' accumulates the total power of minions on the other side. In each iteration, the power 'p' is added to 'a' if the house is on one side, or to 'b' if it's on the other side.\",\n    \"The problem statement declares x, y, m, and c, and p as integers so they need to be mapped as integers.\",\n    \"If houses could be on the river, you'd need to decide which 'village' those houses belong to. You could either always assign them to village 'a', always to village 'b', or implement logic to balance them between the villages (e.g., assign them to the village with the lower current power). The comparison would need to be adjusted to `Y[i] >= (m * X[i] + c)` or `Y[i] <= (m * X[i] + c)` depending on which side of the line the 'on the line' houses are counted.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
