Since n can be very large (up to 10^16), a direct factorial calculation is not feasible due to potential overflow and time complexity issues.\\n- Identifying Constraints and Edge Cases: The key constraints are the large size of n and the requirement to calculate the result modulo 1000003.  Edge cases include when r > n, in which case the result is 0, and when r = 0, in which case the result is 1.\\n- Choosing an Algorithm: Since n can be much larger than the modulo, we can use Lucas's Theorem to decompose the nCr calculation into smaller calculations involving n % M and r % M, where M is the modulo. The factorial values modulo M can be precomputed to optimize time complexity. The modular inverse is required for the division, so we must use Fermat's Little Theorem to calculate inverse modulo.\\n- Optimizing for Modulo: The problem requires calculating nCr modulo 1000003 (M). Precompute factorials modulo M to allow for fast calculation of nCr modulo M for smaller n and r. Use Fermat's Little Theorem (a^(M-2) mod M) to find the modular inverse since M is prime.

Therefore, the modular inverse of a mod p is a^(p-2) mod p. We need it to compute the divisions in the nCr formula under modulo.\",\n    \"The time complexity is approximately O(M + log_M(n)), where M is the modulo (1000003). Precomputing factorials takes O(M) time and allows each small combination to be computed in O(log M) (due to pow function), and the number of such combinations is O(log_M(n)) because of Lucas Theorem. Without precomputation the time complexity would be too high for large n.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
