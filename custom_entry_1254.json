Some cells were wasteland, and other each cell contained crop plants: either carrots or kiwis or grapes. \\n\\nAfter seeing the field carefully, Ciel found that the crop plants of each cell were planted in following procedure:\\n\\n  * Assume that the rows are numbered 1 to n from top to bottom and the columns are numbered 1 to m from left to right, and a cell in row i and column j is represented as (i, j). \\n  * First, each field is either cultivated or waste. Crop plants will be planted in the cultivated cells in the order of (1, 1) \u2192 ... \u2192 (1, m) \u2192 (2, 1) \u2192 ... \u2192 (2, m) \u2192 ... \u2192 (n, 1) \u2192 ... \u2192 (n, m). Waste cells will be ignored. \\n  * Crop plants (either carrots or kiwis or grapes) will be planted in each cell one after another cyclically. Carrots will be planted in the first cell, then kiwis in the second one, grapes in the third one, carrots in the forth one, kiwis in the fifth one, and so on. \\n\\n\\nThe following figure will show you the example of this procedure. Here, a white square represents a cultivated cell, and a black square represents a waste cell.\\n\\n<image>\\n\\nNow she is wondering how to determine the crop plants in some certain cells. \\n\\nInput\\n\\nIn the first line there are four positive integers n, m, k, t (1 \u2264 n \u2264 4\u00b7104, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 4\u00b7104, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 103, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 103), each of which represents the height of the field, the width of the field, the number of waste cells and the number of queries that ask the kind of crop plants in a certain cell.\\n\\nFollowing each k lines contains two integers a, b (1 \u2264 a \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 b \u2264 m), which denotes a cell (a, b) is waste. It is guaranteed that the same cell will not appear twice in this section.\\n\\nFollowing each t lines contains two integers i, j (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m), which is a query that asks you the kind of crop plants of a cell (i, j).\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nFor each query, if the cell is waste, print Waste. Otherwise, print the name of crop plants in the cell: either Carrots or Kiwis or Grapes.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nInput\\n\\n4 5 5 6\\n4 3\\n1 3\\n3 3\\n2 5\\n3 2\\n1 3\\n1 4\\n2 3\\n2 4\\n1 1\\n1 1\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nWaste\\nGrapes\\nCarrots\\nKiwis\\nCarrots\\nCarrots\\n\\nNote\\n\\nThe sample corresponds to the figure in the statement.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"(n, m, k, t) = map(int, input().split(' '))\\nfield = []\\nfor _ in range(k):\\n\\t(a, b) = map(int, input().split(' '))\\n\\tfield.append((a - 1) * m + (b - 1))\\nfield.sort()\\ndic = {0: 'Carrots', 1: 'Kiwis', 2: 'Grapes'}\\nfor _ in range(t):\\n\\tflag = 0\\n\\t(x, y) = map(int, input().split(' '))\\n\\tvalue = (x - 1) * m + (y - 1)\\n\\tfor i in range(len(field)):\\n\\t\\tif value == field[i]:\\n\\t\\t\\tprint('Waste')\\n\\t\\t\\tflag = 1\\n\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\t\\telif value < field[i]:\\n\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\t\\telif value > field[i] and i == len(field) - 1:\\n\\t\\t\\ti += 1\\n\\tif flag == 0:\\n\\t\\tprint(dic[(value - i) % 3])\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understand the Problem: The problem describes a field of cells, some of which are wasteland and others which contain crop plants (carrots, kiwis, or grapes). The crops are planted in a specific order, skipping wasteland cells. We need to determine the crop type for a given cell or identify if it is a wasteland.\\n- Input Processing: Read the input values n, m, k, and t representing field dimensions, waste cell count, and query count. Read the coordinates of the waste cells and store them. Read the coordinates of each query cell and determine the crop type.\\n- Algorithm Design: Represent each cell (i, j) as a single number using the formula (i-1)*m + (j-1). Store the waste cells as a sorted list of such numbers. For each query cell, calculate its corresponding number. Check if the cell is waste. If not, determine how many cultivated cells come before it. Using the count of cultivated cells calculate, determine which crop is planted in that cell, using modulo 3 operator.\\n- Optimization: Sort the waste cells for efficient searching. Use appropriate data structures for storing waste cells and crops to ensure fast lookups.\\n- Edge Cases: Consider edge cases such as empty waste list.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you represent a 2D cell (i, j) as a single number?\",\n    \"How do you determine if a given cell is a wasteland?\",\n    \"How do you efficiently determine the number of cultivated cells before a given cell?\",\n    \"How do you determine the type of crop planted in a cell, given the number of cultivated cells before it?\",\n    \"What data structures are most suitable for storing waste cells and why?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"You can represent a cell (i, j) as a single number using the formula (i - 1) * m + (j - 1), where n is the height of the field and m is its width. This assumes row-major order.\",\n    \"To determine if a cell is a wasteland, you check if its single-number representation exists within the stored list/set of waste cells.\",\n    \"Sort the waste cell coordinates. Then, for each query cell, iterate through the sorted list of waste cells to determine the count. Binary search can improve performance.\",\n    \"You can determine the type of crop by taking the modulo 3 of the count of cultivated cells before it. 0 corresponds to carrots, 1 to kiwis, and 2 to grapes.\",\n    \"A sorted list or a set. A set provides fast checks for wasteland cell. A sorted list enables relatively fast finding of the number of waste cells before a certain point.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
