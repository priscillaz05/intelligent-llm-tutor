The number of such sequences is K^N. Modulo operation is used to prevent overflow.\\n- Devising a strategy: Iterate through all possible GCD values from 1 to K. For each GCD 'g', determine the number of sequences that have 'g' as their GCD. The total sum would be the sum of (g * number of sequences with GCD 'g').\\n- Handling the modulo operation: Ensure that all intermediate results are taken modulo (10^9 + 7) to prevent overflow and provide the final answer in the correct format.\\n- Efficient Computation: A naive brute-force approach would be highly inefficient due to the large input constraints. A more efficient approach is needed, like inclusion-exclusion.\\n- Implementation Details: Use dynamic programming or number theory properties to compute the counts of sequences that share a particular GCD.
