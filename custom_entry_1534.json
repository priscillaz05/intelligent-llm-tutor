"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"Your task is to write a function that takes two or more objects and returns a new object which combines all the input objects. \\n\\nAll input object properties will have only numeric values. Objects are combined together so that the values of matching keys are added together.\\n\\nAn example:\\n\\n```python\\nobjA = { 'a': 10, 'b': 20, 'c': 30 }\\nobjB = { 'a': 3, 'c': 6, 'd': 3 }\\ncombine(objA, objB) # Returns { a: 13, b: 20, c: 36, d: 3 }\\n```\\n\\nThe combine function should be a good citizen, so should not mutate the input objects.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def combine(*bs):\\n\\tc = {}\\n\\tfor b in bs:\\n\\t\\tfor (k, v) in list(b.items()):\\n\\t\\t\\tc[k] = v + c.get(k, 0)\\n\\treturn c\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The function needs to merge multiple objects into a single object, summing the values for keys present in more than one object. The input objects are assumed to only have numeric values.\\n- Avoiding Side Effects: Ensure that the input objects remain unchanged during the combination process to act as a good citizen.\\n- Choosing Data Structures: Use a new dictionary to store the combined object, iterating over each input object and its key-value pairs.\\n- Algorithm Selection: For each key, add its value to the accumulator dictionary. Use the `.get()` method with a default of 0 to handle missing keys in the combined dictionary.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What approach should be taken to accumulate the values of common keys across multiple input objects?\",\n    \"How would you ensure that the input objects are not altered during the combination process?\",\n    \"How can the `.get()` method be used to simplify the accumulation of values for existing and new keys in the combined object?\",\n    \"How would you handle the case where the input is an empty list of objects?\",\n    \"Is there any concern about potential type mismatches, given the problem states that all values are numeric?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"You can iterate through each object and, for each key, add its value to an accumulator object. If the key already exists, add to the existing value. If not, create a new entry.\",\n    \"You should create a new object to store the combined results instead of directly modifying any of the input objects.\",\n    \"Using `.get(key, 0)` allows you to retrieve the current value associated with a key in the combined object, defaulting to 0 if the key doesn't exist yet. This simplifies adding the new value to the existing or initial value.\",\n    \"If the input is an empty list of objects, you should return an empty object, as there is nothing to combine.\",\n    \"Since the problem explicitly states that all values are numeric, you can assume there will be no type mismatches, and you can safely perform addition.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
