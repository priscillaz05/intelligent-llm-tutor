He draws out 1 card from each deck randomly with each card having an equal probability of being drawn.\\n\\nMoEngage drew cards numbered A and B from the decks 1 and 2 respectively. Now, he wonders what is the probability that he will end up with a *funny hand* after drawing the third card.\\n\\nA *funny hand* is when 3 consecutive numbered cards are present in your hand.  \\nHelp MoEngage calculate the probability of ending up with a *funny hand* after drawing the third card.\\n\\nIf the final probability of ending up with a *funny hand* is P, you need to print the value P\\\\cdot N. It can be shown that this value is an integer.\\n\\n------ Input Format ------ \\n\\n- First line will contain T, the number of test cases.

This can happen if C is A-1, A+1, B-1, or B+1. The consecutive numbers do not necessarily have to be in increasing order.\\n- Formulating Edge Cases: Consider cases where A and B are consecutive or nearly consecutive (differing by 2). Also, consider boundary conditions when A or B is 1 or N, as this might limit the possible consecutive sequences.\\n- Developing the Logic: If A and B are the same or the difference is more than 2, it is impossible to form a funny hand. If either A or B is 1 or N, then one card can make a funny hand. Otherwise, there will be 2 cards that can make a funny hand. Count the number of cards that will result in a funny hand and divide by N to get the probability and multiply by N to get the final output.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What constitutes a 'funny hand' in this problem, and how does it relate to the values of cards A, B, and the potential third card C?\",\n    \"What conditions or edge cases can immediately result in a probability of 0, meaning a 'funny hand' is impossible?\",\n    \"How do the boundary conditions (when A or B are 1 or N) affect the number of cards that can form a 'funny hand'?\",\n    \"If A and B are not consecutive or nearly consecutive, and neither is a boundary value, how many possibilities exist for the third card C to create a 'funny hand'?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A 'funny hand' is a set of three cards with consecutive numbers. The third card C must create a sequence of three consecutive numbers with A and B such that drawing C results in the funny hand.\",\n    \"If A and B are the same value, or their difference is greater than 2, it's impossible to form a funny hand, resulting in a probability of 0.\",\n    \"If either A or B is 1 or N, there is often only one possibility that would work, and thus there can be only one card.\",\n    \"If A and B differ by one, and neither are the boundry values, the resulting calculation after P * N will be 2.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
