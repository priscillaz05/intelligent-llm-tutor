The // operator should be used for integer division in this problem because the problem specifically asks for integer division.\",\n    \"The divmod() function takes two numbers as arguments and returns a tuple containing their quotient and remainder.

To make the / operator behave like float division as in Python 3, you would need to import division from __future__ by adding from __future__ import division at the beginning of the script.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
