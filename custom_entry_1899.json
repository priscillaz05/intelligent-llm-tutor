The fee structure is as follows: \\n\\nIf the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charged (i.e.: $fine=0)$.\\nIf the book is returned after the expected return day but still within the same calendar month and year as the expected return date, $fine=15\\ \\text{Hackos}\\ \\times\\ \\text{(the number of days later)}$. \\nIf the book is returned after the expected return month but still within the same calendar year as the expected return date, the $fine=500\\ \\text{Hackos}\\ \\times\\ \\text{(the number of months rate)}$.   \\nIf the book is returned after the calendar year in which it was expected, there is a fixed fine of $10000\\ \\textbf{Hackos}$.\\n\\nCharges are based only on the least precise measure of lateness.  For example, whether a book is due January 1, 2017 or December 31, 2017, if it is returned January 1, 2018, that is a year late and the fine would be $10,000\\ \\text{Hackos}$.  \\n\\nExample \\n\\n$d1,m1,y1=14,7,2018$ \\n\\n$d2,m2,y2=5,7,2018$  \\n\\nThe first values are the return date and the second are the due date.  The years are the same and the months are the same.  The book is $14-5=9$ days late.  Return $9*15=135$.  \\n\\nFunction Description  \\n\\nComplete the libraryFine function in the editor below.  \\n\\nlibraryFine has the following parameter(s):  \\n\\nd1, m1, y1: returned date day, month and year, each an integer  \\nd2, m2, y2: due date day, month and year, each an integer    \\n\\nReturns  \\n\\nint:  the amount of the fine or $\\\\mbox{o}$ if there is none\\n\\nInput Format\\n\\nThe first line contains $3$ space-separated integers, $d1,m1,y1$, denoting the respective $\\\\boldsymbol{day}$, $\\\\textit{month}$, and $year$ on which the book was returned. \\n\\nThe second line contains $3$ space-separated integers, $d2,m2,y2$, denoting the respective $\\\\boldsymbol{day}$, $\\\\textit{month}$, and $year$ on which the book was due to be returned.\\n\\nConstraints\\n\\n$1\\\\leq d1,d2\\\\leq31$     \\n$1\\\\leq m1,m2\\\\leq12$     \\n$1\\\\leq y1,y2\\\\leq3000$  \\n$\\\\textbf{It is generated that the dates will be valid Gregion calendar dates.}$\\n\\nSample Input\\n9 6 2015\\n6 6 2015\\n\\nSample Output\\n45\\n\\nExplanation\\n\\nGiven the following dates: \\n\\nReturned: $d1=9,m1=6,y1=2015$ \\n\\nDue: $d2=6,m2=6,y2=2015$\\n\\nBecause $y2\\\\equiv y1$, we know it is less than a year late. \\n\\nBecause $\\\\textit{m2}\\\\equiv\\\\textit{m1}$, we know it's less than a month late. \\n\\nBecause $d2<d1$, we know that it was returned late (but still within the same month and year).  \\n\\nPer the library's fee structure, we know that our fine will be $15\\\\ \\text{Hackos}\\\\ \\times\\\\ (\\#\\\\ \\text{days rate})$. We then print the result of $15\\\\times(d1-d2)=15\\\\times(9-6)=45$ as our output.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def fine(actual, expected):\\n\\tif actual[2] > expected[2]:\\n\\t\\treturn 10000\\n\\telif actual[2] == expected[2]:\\n\\t\\tif actual[1] > expected[1]:\\n\\t\\t\\treturn 500 * (actual[1] - expected[1])\\n\\t\\telif actual[1] == expected[1]:\\n\\t\\t\\tif actual[0] > expected[0]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn 15 * (actual[0] - expected[0])\\n\\treturn 0\\nactual_return_date = input().split(' ')\\nexpected_return_date = input().split(' ')\\nactual_return_date = [int(number) for number in actual_return_date]\\nexpected_return_date = [int(number) for number in expected_return_date]\\nprint(fine(actual_return_date, expected_return_date))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires calculating library fines based on the return date compared to the due date. Different penalties apply based on whether the book is late by days, months, or years.\\n- Devising a Conditional Strategy: Plan a series of conditional checks to determine which fine structure applies: year, month, day, or no fine at all.\\n- Handling Input and Calling Function: The code needs to take date values as input, convert them to integers, then pass the actual and expected dates to the fine calculation function.\\n- Implementing Fine Logic: Implement the core fine calculation logic using if/elif/else statements to check the return date against the due date at each level (year, month, day) and apply the appropriate penalty.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How should the program handle scenarios where the return date is before the due date, and what should the output be in this case?\",\n    \"What is the appropriate data structure to store the return and due dates, and how can the dates be accessed for comparison?\",\n    \"How can the program handle potential input errors, such as non-integer values or invalid date formats?\",\n    \"If both month and year are the same, what is the logic for calculating the fine based on the number of days late?\",\n    \"What is the order of conditional checks that should be followed to ensure the correct fine is calculated?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"If the book is returned on or before the due date, the fine should be 0.\",\n    \"Lists can store the dates.

Input validation might also be added.\",\n    \"If the month and year are the same, calculate the fine as 15 Hackos multiplied by the number of days the book is late, which is the return day minus the due day.\",\n    \"The checks should be ordered from the most significant to the least: year, then month (if years are the same), then day (if months and years are the same). This ensures the fine is calculated based on the least precise measure of lateness.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
