Let's denote the number of candies GukiZ gave to the $i$-th student by $p_i$. As GukiZ has a lot of students, he does not remember all the exact numbers of candies he gave to the students. He only remembers the following properties of the sequence $p$:\\n- The numbers of candies given to each of the first $K$ students ($p_1, p_2, \\\\dots, p_K$) are known exactly.\\n- All elements of the sequence $p$ are distinct and positive.\\n- GukiZ didn't give more than $x$ candies to any student (the maximum value in the sequence $p$ is not greater than $x$).\\n- For each student $i$, there is at least one other student $j$ such that $|p_i - p_j| \\\\le D$.\\n- The professor gave out the biggest possible total number of candies, i.e. $S = p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + \\\\ldots + p_N$ is maximum possible.\\nGukiZ would like to know the total number of candies $S$ he had at the beginning. However, times change and after six days, the professor is really tired, so it is possible that there is no sequence $p$ which satisfies the constraints. Can you help GukiZ find the number of candies he gave out, or tell him that he must have made a mistake?\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\\n- The first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers $N$, $K$, $x$, $D$.\\n- The second line contains $K$ distinct space-separated integers $p_1, p_2, \\\\dots, p_K$.\\n\\n-----Output-----\\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \u2014 the number of candies GukiZ had, or $-1$ if there is no valid sequence $p$.\\n\\n-----Constraints-----\\n- $1 \\\\le T \\\\le 50$\\n- $3 \\\\le N \\\\le 10^9$\\n- $1 \\\\le K \\\\le \\\\mathrm{min}(N, 2 \\\\cdot 10^4)$ \\n- $1 \\\\le x \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^9$\\n- $1 \\\\le D \\\\le 10^9$\\n- $1 \\\\le p_i \\\\le x$ for each valid $i$\\n- All values $p_i$ from input are distinct\\n\\n-----Subtasks-----\\nSubtask #1 (15 points): $1 \\\\leq x, N, D \\\\leq 15$ \\nSubtask #2 (35 points): $1 \\\\leq x, N, D \\\\leq 10^5$ \\nSubtask #3 (50 points): original constraints\\n\\n-----Example Input-----\\n2\\n4 3 5 3\\n2 1 5\\n3 2 8 2\\n3 8\\n\\n-----Example Output-----\\n12\\n-1\\n\\n-----Explanation-----\\nExample case 1: There are four students. We know that the first student got $p_1 = 2$ candies, the second student got $p_2 = 1$ and the third got $p_3 = 5$ candies; we don't know the number of candies given to the last student. The maximum possible amount of candies given to some student is $x=5$. The best possible option is giving $p_4=4$ candies to the last student. Then, the fourth constraint (with $D=3$) is satisfied for all students. Only the pair of students $(2, 3)$ have numbers of candies that differ by more than $3$, but still, for each student, there are at least two other students with close enough numbers of candies.\\nExample case 2: GukiZ made some mistake in distribution and there is no valid sequence $p$. The answer is $-1$.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def ctlt(arr, val):\\n\\tif arr[0] >= val:\\n\\t\\treturn 0\\n\\tlo = 0\\n\\thi = len(arr)\\n\\twhile hi - lo > 1:\\n\\t\\tmd = (hi + lo) // 2\\n\\t\\tif arr[md] < val:\\n\\t\\t\\tlo = md\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\thi = md\\n\\treturn hi\\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\\n\\t(n, k, x, d) = map(int, input().split())\\n\\tz = input().strip().split()\\n\\tif k > 0:\\n\\t\\tps = list(map(int, z[:k]))\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tps = [x]\\n\\tps.sort()\\n\\tif x < n or x < ps[-1] or n < k:\\n\\t\\tprint(-1)\\n\\t\\tcontinue\\n\\tvalchecked = 0\\n\\tfillval = 0\\n\\tvalsdone = False\\n\\tisolbelow = True\\n\\tlastp = ps[0]\\n\\twhile not valsdone and n >= k:\\n\\t\\tif n == k:\\n\\t\\t\\tlo = x + d + 1\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tlo = 1\\n\\t\\t\\thi = x + 1\\n\\t\\t\\twhile hi - lo > 1:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmd = (hi + lo) // 2\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tv = x - md + 1 + ctlt(ps, md)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif v < n:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thi = md\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlo = md\\n\\t\\tvalsdone = True\\n\\t\\tcheckto = ctlt(ps, lo) - 1\\n\\t\\tif checkto >= valchecked:\\n\\t\\t\\tfor p in ps[valchecked + 1:checkto + 1]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif lastp + d >= p:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tisolbelow = False\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telif isolbelow:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tvalsdone = False\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfillval += lastp + d\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tn -= 1\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tisolbelow = p > lastp + 2 * d\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tisolbelow = True\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlastp = p\\n\\t\\t\\tvalchecked = checkto\\n\\t\\t\\tif valsdone and isolbelow:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif lastp + d >= lo:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tisolbelow = False\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tvalsdone = False\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfillval += lastp\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tps[checkto] += d\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlastp += d\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tisolbelow = False\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tn -= 1\\n\\tif k > n:\\n\\t\\tprint(-1)\\n\\telif k == n:\\n\\t\\tprint(sum(ps) + fillval)\\n\\telif k == n - 1 and lo > ps[-1]:\\n\\t\\tprint(sum(ps) + fillval + min(x, ps[-1] + d))\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\ttot = (x + lo) * (x - lo + 1) // 2 + sum(ps[:ctlt(ps, lo)])\\n\\t\\tprint(tot + fillval)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding Problem Constraints: Acknowledge the need to maximize the total candies S given to N students under the provided constraints, including known candies for the first K students, distinct positive candies, a maximum candy limit X, a closeness constraint D, and the possibility of no valid solution.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Consider invalid input cases where a solution is not possible (e.g., conflicting constraints, K > N). Recognize the complexity of maximizing S while ensuring all conditions are met.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Think about constructing the sequence p incrementally to maximize the sum. Use sorting to simplify checking the closeness constraint.
