A special node is defined as a node connected to exactly one other node.\\n- Identifying Edge Cases: Consider edge cases like an empty tree, a tree with only one node (which would be a special node), or cases where either the left or right child of a node is null.\\n- Choosing an Appropriate Data Structure or Algorithm: A recursive depth-first search (DFS) approach can be used to traverse the tree. The key idea is to compute the maximum path sum starting from each node and update the global maximum as you traverse.\\n- Recursive Implementation: Implement a recursive function to calculate the maximum path sum rooted at each node. Handle the base cases for leaf nodes and null nodes. For each node, compute the path sum including the node's value and recursively calculate the maximum path sums from its left and right children.\\n- Optimizing the Solution: Ensure the solution considers the constraint that the path should start and end at a special node. This implies only considering paths where the start and end points have only one connection (i.e., are leaves or have only one child).\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What defines a 'special node' in this problem, and how does that constraint influence the possible paths?\",\n    \"What are the base cases for the recursive approach, and how should the recursion handle null nodes or leaf nodes?\",\n    \"How do you keep track of the maximum path sum found so far during the recursive traversal?\",\n    \"How can you use the return values of recursive calls to build up the maximum path sum at each node?\",\n    \"What edge cases should you consider in the binary tree (e.g., empty tree, single node tree), and how should your algorithm handle them?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A 'special node' is a node connected to exactly one other node (degree of 1). This constraint limits the possible start and end nodes of the path, typically meaning that the path has to start or end at a leaf node or a node with only one child.\",\n    \"The base cases include null nodes and leaf nodes. For a null node, the maximum path sum is typically negative infinity. For a leaf node, the maximum path sum is the value of the node itself.\",\n    \"A global variable (or nonlocal in the recursive helper function) is used to keep track of the maximum path sum encountered so far. Each time a new potential maximum path sum is found, the global variable is updated.\",\n    \"The return values of the recursive calls represent the maximum path sum that can be obtained from each subtree rooted at the children. These values are used to calculate the maximum path sum that includes the current node.\",\n    \"Edge cases include an empty tree (where the result would be negative infinity or a suitable error value), a tree with a single node (where the result would be the value of that node), and trees where all nodes have negative values (where the optimal path might be a single node with the least negative value).\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
