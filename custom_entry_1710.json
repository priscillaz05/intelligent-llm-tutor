This involves bitwise XOR operations and comparisons.\\n- Identifying Constraints: The constraints are that 'a' must be between 0 and x, and the XOR result must be greater than x. The problem also includes multiple queries, suggesting an efficient solution is needed.\\n- Developing an Algorithm: The key insight is to analyze the binary representation of x. For a XOR x to be greater than x, 'a' must have a '1' bit in a position where 'x' has a '0' bit. Also, 'a' must be less than 'x'. The solution iterates through the bits of x, and if a bit is 0, it adds the corresponding power of 2 to the result. This logic efficiently computes the number of valid 'a' values.\\n- Optimization and Edge Cases:  Consider edge cases such as when x is 0 or 1. The problem statement says that 1 <= x <= 10^10. There's no need to explicitly handle x=0 as it is outside the range, but ensure the loop terminates correctly when x becomes 0.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does the XOR operation do, and how can we use it to determine if `a XOR x > x`?\",\n    \"Given the constraint `0 < a < x`, how does this limit the possible values of `a`?\",\n    \"How can we efficiently count the number of valid `a` values without iterating through all possible values?\",\n    \"How does the binary representation of `x` help determine the possible values of `a` that satisfy the given conditions?\",\n    \"What is the significance of the positions where the bits of `x` are zero in determining valid values for `a`?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"XOR returns 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they are the same. `a XOR x > x` means 'a' must introduce a '1' bit in a position where 'x' has a '0' to make the result larger.\",\n    \"`0 < a < x` means 'a' is a positive integer less than `x`. This significantly reduces the search space, but we still need an efficient way to count valid `a` values.\",\n    \"We can analyze the binary representation of `x` and consider the positions where bits are zero.  Each zero bit in `x` allows us to construct valid `a` values by setting the corresponding bit in `a` to one.\",\n    \"The binary representation of `x` helps us identify which bits can be flipped in `a` (from 0 to 1) to make `a XOR x > x`.  If `x` has a '0' at some bit position, setting the corresponding bit in 'a' to '1' can make `a XOR x > x`.\",\n    \"When `x` has a '0' at a certain position, setting the corresponding bit in 'a' to '1' will always make `a XOR x` larger than `x`, provided the resulting `a` is still less than `x`.  This is because it introduces a higher-order bit, so, we have to iterate over all bits of X.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
