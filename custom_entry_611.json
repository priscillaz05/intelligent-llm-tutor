The percentage of these changes relative to the string's length is crucial.\\n- Defining the Threshold: Understand that more than 20% change leads to \\\"Throw Up\\\", otherwise \\\"No Problem\\\".\\n- Formulating the Logic: Count occurrences of '~_' and '_~', sum them, divide by the string length, and compare against the 0.2 threshold.\\n- Translating to Code: Efficiently implement the logic using string methods and a conditional expression.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the characters representing wave and calm, and how do you identify a change in level?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the percentage of level changes in the string?\",\n    \"What is the threshold percentage for seasickness, and what output corresponds to going over or staying under it?\",\n    \"Are there edge cases to consider such as an empty string or a string with no changes, and how would you handle them?\",\n    \"How would you implement your approach using Python string functions to avoid explicit looping?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The characters representing wave and calm are '~' and '_', respectively.
