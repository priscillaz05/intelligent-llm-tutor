Know the problem is, There is a fight going between the students of the class they have splitted up into two groups the odd rulers and the even rulers. To resolve this fight sir will randomly pick up the numbers and are written on the board. Teacher stated that if the total sum of all even numbers occuring in the collatz sequence for a number when it is divided by the total no of steps to reach 1 remainder is named as odd remainder will be compared with  the even remainder i.e., sum of all odd numbers in sequence divided with steps the resulting remainder. If the odd remainder is greater than even then odd rulers win, if even remainder is more than odd remainder then even rulers win. if both are same then there is a tie.\\n\\nINPUT:\\nFirst line contains number of test cases T.\\nNext T line contains a number N for each line\\nOUTPUT:\\nfor every respective N print either \\\"Even Rules\\\" or \\\"Odd Rules\\\" or \\\"Tie\\\" according to the problem.\\n\\nExplanation:\\nfor n=4, steps followed are 4->2->1 no of steps is 2 and even sum is 6 and odd sum is 1  since 6%2 < 1%2 so Odd Rules\\n\\nSAMPLE INPUT\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n\\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\\nEven Rules\\nOdd Rules\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"for _ in range(eval(input())):\\n\\tnum = eval(input())\\n\\toddsum = 1\\n\\tevensum = 0\\n\\ttotsteps = 0\\n\\twhile num > 1:\\n\\t\\tif num % 2 == 0:\\n\\t\\t\\tevensum += num\\n\\t\\t\\tnum /= 2\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\toddsum += num\\n\\t\\t\\tnum = (3 * num) + 1\\n\\t\\totsteps += 1\\n\\tevenrem = evensum % totsteps\\n\\toddrem = oddsum % totsteps\\n\\tif oddrem > evenrem:\\n\\t\\tprint(\\\"Odd Rules\\\")\\n\\telif oddrem < evenrem:\\n\\t\\tprint(\\\"Even Rules\\\")\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tprint(\\\"Tie\\\")\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: Comprehend that the problem deals with the Collatz sequence and the task is to determine the 'winner' based on the remainders of sums of even and odd numbers in the sequence.\\n- Decomposing the Sequence: Recognize that for each number N, the Collatz sequence must be generated until it reaches 1. The total steps, the sum of even numbers, and the sum of odd numbers within the sequence must be tracked.\\n- Calculating Remainders: After generating the sequence, compute the even remainder (sum of evens % total steps) and the odd remainder (sum of odds % total steps).\\n- Determining the Winner: Compare the odd and even remainders to determine the output: \\\"Odd Rules\\\" if odd remainder > even remainder, \\\"Even Rules\\\" if even remainder > odd remainder, and \\\"Tie\\\" if they are equal.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you generate the Collatz sequence for a given number?\",\n    \"How do you differentiate and accumulate the sums of even and odd numbers within the Collatz sequence?\",\n    \"How is the total number of steps in the Collatz sequence calculated?\",\n    \"What formula should be used to calculate the even and odd remainders?\",\n    \"Based on the odd and even remainders, how do you determine and output the appropriate winner (\\\"Odd Rules\\\", \\\"Even Rules\\\", or \\\"Tie\\\")?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Start with the given number N.
