"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"HackerChess is a variant of chess played at HackerRank. It is a game played between two players who make moves in turns until one of them cannot make any move. The player who cannot make a move loses the game and the other player is declared the winner. The game is played on a board with $n$ rows and $n$ columns. The only pieces used in the game are rooks. A rook in HackerChess moves only vertically, which means that in never leaves a column to which it belongs. Moreover, in a single move, a rook moves through any number of unoccupied cells. Notice that there are no captures in HackerChess, two rooks cannot occupy the same cell, and a rook cannot jump over another rook. Each player has exactly one rook in each of the $n$ columns of the board.\\n\\nGiven the initial position of the rooks and knowing that the second player makes the first move, decide who will win the game if both players play optimally.\\n\\nInput Format\\n\\nIn the first line, there is a single integer $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\boldsymbol{t}}$ denoting the number of games to be played. After that, descriptions of $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\boldsymbol{t}}$ games follow:\\n\\nIn the first line, there is a single integer $n$ denoting the size of the board. Next, $n$ lines follow. In the $\\\\boldsymbol{i}$-th of them there is a single integer $r_{1,i}$ denoting the row of the rook belonging to the first player placed in the $\\\\boldsymbol{i}$-th column. After that, another $n$ lines follow. In the $\\\\boldsymbol{i}$-th of them there is a single integer $r_{2,i}$ denoting the row of the rook belonging to the second player placed in the $\\\\boldsymbol{i}$-th column.\\n\\nConstraints\\n\\n$1\\\\leq t\\\\leq10$  \\n$2\\\\leq n\\\\leq2000$\\n$1\\\\leq r_{1,i},r_{2,i}\\\\leq n$\\n$r_{1,i}\\\\neq r_{2,i}$\\n\\nOutput Format\\n\\nPrint exactly $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\boldsymbol{t}}$ lines. In the $\\\\boldsymbol{i}$-th of them, print player-1 if the first player will win the $\\\\boldsymbol{i}$-th game. Otherwise, print player-2 in this line.\\n\\nSample Input 0\\n1\\n3\\n1\\n2\\n2\\n3\\n1\\n1\\n\\nSample Output 0\\nplayer-2\\n\\nExplanation 0\\n\\nThere is only one game player in the sample input. The game is played on the board with $3$ rows and $3$ columns. Let's denote the first player's rooks as red rooks and the second player's rooks as green ones. Then the initial position of the game looks like this:\\n\\nThe second player moves first and he can move his rook in the first column to the second row. After this move, the position looks as follows:\\n\\nNext, it is the first player's turn. He cannot make any move with his rook in the first column, so he has to make a move in the second or the third column. Without the loss of generality, let's assume that he makes a move in the second column. He can only make one such move, i.e. move the rook from the second to the third row. This results in the following position:\\n\\nAfter that, the best move for the second player is to move his rook in the second column from the first to the second row. After this move, the position looks like this:\\n\\nNext, it is again the first player's move. The only move he can make is to move his rook in the third column from the second to the third row. It results in the following position:\\n\\nThen, the best move for the second player is to move his rook in the third column from the first to the second row. After that, the position looks as follows:\\n\\nNext, it is the first player's move, but since he is unable to make any valid move, he loses and the second player is declared a winner.\\n\\nIt shows that regardless of the first player's moves, the second player has a strategy leading to his victory.\\n\\nSample Input 1\\n1\\n4\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n4\\n4\\n4\\n4\\n\\nSample Output 1\\nplayer-1\\n\\nExplanation 1\\n\\nSecond player cannot make a move so $\\\\textit{player-1}$ is the winner.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"from functools import reduce\\n\\ndef processTestCase():\\n\\tn = int(input())\\n\\tp1 = [int(input()) for i in range(n)]\\n\\tp2 = [int(input()) for i in range(n)]\\n\\tp = [abs(p1[i] - p2[i]) - 1 for i in range(n)]\\n\\tnimsum = reduce(lambda x, y: x ^ y, p)\\n\\tif nimsum is 0:\\n\\t\\tprint('player-1')\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tprint('player-2')\\nt = int(input())\\nfor i in range(t):\\n\\tprocessTestCase()\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Game Rules: The game is played on an n x n board with rooks. Rooks can only move vertically any number of unoccupied cells. There are no captures, and two rooks cannot occupy the same cell.\\n- Recognizing Winning/Losing Conditions: The player who cannot make a move loses.\\n- Identifying Key Information: The second player always makes the first move. The goal is to determine the winner if both players play optimally.\\n- Formulating a Strategy: This looks like a game theory problem, likely solvable using Nim game principles. The distance between the rooks in each column (minus 1) represents the number of moves available in that column, similar to piles in Nim. The XOR sum (Nim sum) of these moves determines the winner. If the Nim sum is zero, the first player (who is actually the second player in the problem) to move will lose if the other plays optimally, so Player 1 wins. Otherwise, Player 2 wins.\\n- Handling Input: Read the number of test cases, then for each test case, read the board size, the positions of player 1's rooks, and the positions of player 2's rooks.\\n- Calculating Differences: Calculate the absolute difference in row positions of the rooks in each column and subtract 1 to determine the number of available moves in each \\\"pile\\\".\\n- Calculating Nim Sum: Calculate the XOR sum of these differences. This is the Nim sum.\\n- Determining the Winner: If the Nim sum is 0, print \\\"player-1\\\". Otherwise, print \\\"player-2\\\".\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for a player to play 'optimally' in this context?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: Playing optimally means making moves that guarantee a win if possible, or delaying a loss for as long as possible.
