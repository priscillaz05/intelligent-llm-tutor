Return -1 in this case.\\n- Determining Maximum Repetitions: The maximum number of repetitions needed can be estimated based on the lengths of A and B. Specifically, len(B) // len(A) + 3 provides a reasonable upper bound, accounting for cases where B might wrap around A.\\n- Iterative Repetition and Substring Check: Concatenate A repeatedly and check if B is a substring of the concatenated string. Track the number of repetitions.\\n- Returning the Minimum Repetitions or -1: If B is found as a substring, return the number of repetitions.
