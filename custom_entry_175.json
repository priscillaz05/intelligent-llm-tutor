The sequence will contain bus **numbers** and TFL tube names as **strings** e.g.\\n\\n```python\\n['Northern', 'Central', 243, 1, 'Victoria']\\n```\\nJourneys will always only contain a combination of tube names and bus numbers. Each tube journey costs `\u00a32.40` and each bus journey costs `\u00a31.50`. If there are `2` or more adjacent bus journeys, the bus fare is capped for sets of two adjacent buses and calculated as one bus fare for each set.\\n\\nYour task is to calculate the total cost of the journey and return the cost `rounded to 2 decimal places` in the format (where x is a number): `\u00a3x.xx`\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def london_city_hacker(journey):\\n\\ttube = 2.4\\n\\tbus = 1.5\\n\\ttotal_cost = 0.0\\n\\tcount = 0\\n\\tfor link in journey:\\n\\t\\tif isinstance(link, str):\\n\\t\\t\\ttotal_cost += tube\\n\\t\\t\\tcount = 0\\n\\t\\telif count == 0:\\n\\t\\t\\ttotal_cost += bus\\n\\t\\t\\tcount += 1\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tcount = 0\\n\\treturn '\u00a3{:.2f}'.format(total_cost)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires calculating the total cost of a journey that includes tube and bus rides. Tube rides cost \u00a32.40 each, and bus rides cost \u00a31.50 each. Adjacent bus rides are capped, meaning only the first bus ride in a sequence of adjacent bus rides is charged. The final cost should be formatted as a string rounded to two decimal places.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints and Edge Cases: Need to distinguish between tube rides (strings) and bus rides (numbers). The key constraint is the adjacent bus rides rule, where only the first bus ride in a sequence is charged.  Consider the case of an empty journey, where the cost would be \u00a30.00. Need to handle sequences containing only tube or bus rides, or a mixture of both.\\n- Devising an Algorithmic Strategy: Iterate through the journey list. Use `isinstance` to determine whether each item is a string (tube) or a number (bus). Use a counter to track consecutive bus rides. If a bus ride is encountered and the counter is 0, charge for the bus and increment the counter. If the counter is already greater than 0, reset the counter to 0, effectively skipping the charge for subsequent adjacent buses. Sum the costs as we iterate. Finally, format the result as a string with two decimal places.\\n- Implementation Details: Initialize a `total_cost` variable to 0. Initialize a `bus_count` variable to 0. Use a `for` loop to iterate through each item in the `journey`. Use `isinstance(item, str)` to check if it's a tube ride or a bus ride. If it's a tube, add \u00a32.40 to `total_cost` and reset `bus_count` to 0. If it's a bus and `bus_count` is 0, add \u00a31.50 to `total_cost` and set `bus_count` to 1. If it's a bus and `bus_count` is 1 (or more), set `bus_count` to 0 without adding anything. After the loop, format `total_cost` as a string `\u00a3{:.2f}`.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can I differentiate between a tube journey and a bus journey in the given input list?\",\n    \"How should I handle the 'adjacent bus journeys' rule to calculate the cost correctly?\",\n    \"What data structures should I use to keep track of the total cost and consecutive bus rides?\",\n    \"How do I ensure that the final cost is rounded to two decimal places and formatted as a string in the required format ('\u00a3x.xx')?\",\n    \"What are some potential edge cases or scenarios that I need to consider in my solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"You can use the `isinstance()` function to check if an element is a string (tube journey) or a number (bus journey).\",\n    \"You need to maintain a counter to track consecutive bus journeys.
