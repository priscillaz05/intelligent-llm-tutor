This can be simplified to a = (a XOR x) + x. We need to find how many 'x' values satisfy this equation for each given 'a'.\\n- Simplifying the Equation:  The equation a = (a XOR x) + x holds true if and only if a & x = 0. This is because if a bit is set in both 'a' and 'x', then the XOR will clear the bit in 'a XOR x' and the addition will result in a carry which would require more bits to represent the result. If a & x = 0, then there will be no carry. Since x can only have bits set in positions where a doesn't have bits set, and (a XOR x) + x = a only holds if (a & x) == 0, then the problem is equivalent to counting the number of possible 'x' values where a & x = 0.\\n- Counting Solutions:  The number of solutions is equal to 2 raised to the power of the number of set bits in 'a'. This is because for each set bit in 'a', 'x' must have a 0 in that position. For each unset bit in 'a', 'x' can have either a 0 or a 1 in that position, so there are two choices for each unset bit. The number of solutions is thus 2 to the power of the number of unset bits in a, or equivalently the product of 2's for each set bit in a.\\n- Implementing the Solution: The solution involves reading the input values for 'a' and counting the number of set bits in 'a'.  Then, we calculate 2 raised to the power of the number of set bits. A more efficient way of calculating this is by repeatedly applying the bit trick x & (x-1) to remove each set bit until 'x' becomes 0 and simultaneously multiply an answer variable by two.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the core problem asking, and how can the given equation be simplified to a more manageable form?\",\n    \"What conditions must be met for the equation a = (a XOR x) + x to hold true, and how does this relate to the bitwise AND operation?\",\n    \"How does the number of set bits in 'a' influence the number of possible solutions for 'x'?\",\n    \"What is the optimal approach for counting the number of set bits in 'a' for larger integer values to improve the time complexity of the solution?\",\n    \"What considerations must be taken into account to effectively handle a large number of test cases within the time constraint?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The problem asks for the count of non-negative solutions to the equation a - (a XOR x) - x = 0.
