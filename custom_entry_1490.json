This is also referred to as the 'power' of the string.\\n- Algorithm Selection: Iterate through the string and keep track of the current consecutive characters. When a different character is encountered or the end of string is reached, check if the length of the current streak is the maximum encountered so far. If so, update the maximum length.\\n- Edge Case Handling: The string is guaranteed to have at least one character, therefore, there is no need to handle empty string edge case.\\n- Variable Management: Keep track of `current_count` representing the current streak and `max_count` representing the maximum streak encountered so far.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the meaning of 'power' in the context of the problem and how does it relate to the substrings of the input string?\",\n    \"How would you approach iterating through the string to identify and count consecutive occurrences of the same character?\",\n    \"What variables would you need to keep track of during the iteration, and what information would they hold?\",\n    \"What criteria would you use to determine when a new substring with a different character begins?\",\n    \"How would you ensure that the final result represents the maximum power found across all substrings in the input string?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The 'power' of the string is defined as the maximum length of a substring containing only one unique character.\",\n    \"I would iterate through the string using a loop, comparing each character with the next to identify consecutive occurrences of the same character.\",\n    \"I would need a `current_count` to track the length of the current substring with the same characters and a `max_count` to store the maximum length found so far.\",\n    \"A new substring with a different character begins when the current character is not equal to the next character in the string, or when the end of the string is reached.\",\n    \"After each substring, I would compare its length (`current_count`) with the current maximum length (`max_count`). If the current substring is longer, I would update `max_count` to reflect the new maximum.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
