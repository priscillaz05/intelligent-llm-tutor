Understanding this is crucial because it defines the condition for determining if the input should return 'Yes' or 'No'.\",\n    \"You can convert an integer to a string using the str() function in Python. For example, str(123) would convert the integer 123 to the string '123'.\",\n    \"An efficient way to reverse a string in Python is using string slicing with a step of -1, like reversed_string = original_string[::-1]. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string, and the space complexity is also O(n) because a new reversed string is created.\",\n    \"You can use the .strip() method to remove any leading or trailing spaces from the string representation of the integer. This is important because spaces could cause the comparison between the original and reversed strings to fail even if the core digits form a palindrome.\",\n    \"Given that the constraint limits the input to a small range (1 to 1000), extremely complex algorithms are unnecessary.
