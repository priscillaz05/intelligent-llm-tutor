Will he be able to do so?\\n\\nChef can save all the files on his computer only if the total size of the files is less than or equal to the space available on his computer.\\n\\n------ Input Format ------\\n\\n- The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The T test cases then follow:\\n- The first and only line of each test case contains three integers N, X, Y, denoting the free-space in computer, the number of 1 and 2 GB files respectively.\\n\\n------ Output Format ------\\n\\nFor each test case, print YES if Chef is able to save the files and NO otherwise.\\n\\nYou may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will all be treated as identical).\\n\\n------ Constraints ------\\n\\n$1 \u2264 T \u2264 100$\\n$1 \u2264 N, X, Y \u2264 100$\\n\\n----- Sample Input 1 ------\\n4\\n6 3 1\\n2 2 2\\n4 3 2\\n5 1 2\\n\\n----- Sample Output 1 ------\\nYES\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\n\\n----- explanation 1 ------\\nTest case $1$: The total size of files is $3 + 1 \\\\cdot 2 =5$, which is smaller than the remaining space on the computer. Thus Chef will be able to save all the files.\\n\\nTest case $2$: The total size of files is $2 + 2 \\\\cdot 2 =6$, which is greater than the remaining space on the computer. Thus Chef will not be able to save all the files.\\n\\nTest case $3$: The total size of files is $3 + 2 \\\\cdot 2 =7$, which is greater than the remaining space on the computer. Thus Chef will not be able to save all the files.\\n\\nTest case $4$: The total size of files is $1 + 2 \\\\cdot 2 =5$, which is equal to the remaining space on the computer. Thus Chef will be able to save all the files.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"t = int(input())\\nfor i in range(t):\\n\\t(n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())\\n\\ta = x * 1\\n\\tb = y * 2\\n\\tif n < a + b:\\n\\t\\tprint('NO')\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tprint('YES')\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires determining if the total space required by X files of 1GB each and Y files of 2GB each is less than or equal to N GB of free space.\\n- Input Parsing: Read the number of test cases T. For each test case, read three integers N, X, and Y.\\n- Calculating Total Space: Calculate the total space required by the files: X * 1 + Y * 2.\\n- Comparison: Compare the total space required with the available space N.\\n- Output: Print 'YES' if the total space required is less than or equal to N, and 'NO' otherwise.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you calculate the total space needed for the files?\",\n    \"What is the condition to check if Chef can save the files?\",\n    \"How should the output be formatted, considering case-insensitivity?\",\n    \"What data types should be used for the input variables N, X, and Y?\",\n    \"What is the range of the input values for T, N, X and Y?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The total space needed is calculated by multiplying the number of 1GB files (X) by 1 and the number of 2GB files (Y) by 2, and then summing the results: X * 1 + Y * 2.\",\n    \"Chef can save the files if the total space needed (X * 1 + Y * 2) is less than or equal to the available space N.\",\n    \"The output should be either 'YES' or 'NO', but the comparison is case-insensitive, so any combination of upper and lower case letters will be accepted by the judge.\",\n    \"The input variables N, X, and Y should be integers.\",\n    \"The range of the input values are 1 <= T <= 100, 1 <= N, X, Y <= 100.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
