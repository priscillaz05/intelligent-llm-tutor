This requires checking distances between all pairs of points.\\n- Identifying Key Properties of a Square: A square has four equal sides and two equal diagonals. Therefore, there should be two distinct distances: one for the sides (appearing four times) and one for the diagonals (appearing twice), and the diagonal distance should be twice the side distance.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Compute the distance between each pair of points. Store the counts of each unique distance in a dictionary. Check if there are exactly two distinct distances and that their counts match the square's properties (4 sides, 2 diagonals).\\n- Handling Edge Cases and Invalid Inputs: Consider edge cases such as duplicate points (distance is zero) or collinear points, which would not form a square. Ensure the code handles such cases gracefully and returns 0 when the points do not form a valid square.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the essential geometric properties of a square that can be used to determine if four points form a square?\",\n    \"How can we efficiently calculate the distance between two points in a 2D plane, and what data structures can be used to store and count the distances between all pairs of points?\",\n    \"What are the possible edge cases and invalid inputs that should be considered, and how can these be handled to ensure the robustness of the solution?\",\n    \"Given that we have four points, how many unique distances between pairs of points need to be considered, and how can we avoid redundant calculations?\",\n    \"Once the distances are calculated and their counts are determined, what specific conditions on these counts must be satisfied to confirm that the four points indeed form a square?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A square has four equal sides and two equal diagonals. Therefore, the distances between adjacent vertices must be equal, and the distances between opposite vertices (diagonals) must be equal and sqrt(2) times the side length.\",\n    \"The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) can be calculated using the distance formula: sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2). A dictionary (or hash map) can be used to store each unique distance as a key and its frequency as the value.\",\n    \"Edge cases include: duplicate points (distance is zero), collinear points (points lie on the same line), points that form other shapes like rectangles or parallelograms. The code should return 0 for these cases.\",\n    \"There are 4C2 = 6 unique distances to consider (4! / (2! * 2!) = 6). Each distance should be calculated only once to avoid redundancy. Use nested loops to compute the distances between all pairs, skipping duplicate pairs by ensuring j > i.\",\n    \"For the four points to form a square, there must be exactly two distinct distances: one corresponding to the side length (occurring four times) and one corresponding to the diagonal length (occurring two times). Also, the diagonal distance should be twice the square of the side distance due to the Pythagorean theorem (a^2 + a^2 = c^2, therefore c = sqrt(2) * a, so c^2 = 2 * a^2).\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
