XOR returns true if exactly one input is truthy. OR returns true if at least one input is truthy.\\n- Restrictions: Note the crucial constraint that the `||` operator cannot be used. This requires finding alternative logical expressions.\\n- Truthiness and Falsiness: Remember that Python has the concept of truthy and falsy values, not just booleans. Empty strings and empty arrays are falsy.\\n- XOR Implementation Strategy: The XOR can be expressed using equality: the result is true if the boolean values of the inputs are NOT equal.\\n- OR Implementation Strategy: OR can be implemented by checking if both values are falsey. If not, the result is true.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for a value to be truthy or falsy in Python, especially considering non-boolean types like strings or lists?\",\n    \"Given that you cannot use the `||` operator, how would you implement the OR logic using other operators available in Python?\",\n    \"For the XOR implementation, how can you ensure that your function correctly handles cases where both inputs are truthy or both are falsy?\",\n    \"How would you test your functions to make sure they correctly handle different types of input values (booleans, numbers, strings, lists)?\",\n    \"Why is it important to explicitly convert the input values to booleans using `bool()` before performing the comparisons in the XOR and OR functions?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Truthy values are those that evaluate to `True` in a boolean context, such as non-zero numbers, non-empty strings, and non-empty lists. Falsy values evaluate to `False`, such as 0, empty strings, and empty lists.\",\n    \"I can implement the OR logic by checking if both values are falsy. If `not a and not b` is true, then the OR is false, otherwise it is true. This can be expressed as `not (not a and not b)` or the simplified `not (bool(a) == False and bool(b) == False)`.\",\n    \"To ensure correct XOR behavior, I need to make sure the function returns `False` when both inputs have the same truthiness.

Without this conversion, comparisons may not behave as expected, especially when dealing with truthy and falsy values of different types.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
