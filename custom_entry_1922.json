In America, they used the Fahrenheit (\u2109) scale instead. $20$ degrees Celsius is roughly equal to $68$ degrees Fahrenheit. A phrase such as \\\"Today\u2019s temperature is $68$ degrees\\\" is commonly encountered while you are in America.\\n\\nA value in Fahrenheit can be converted to Celsius by first subtracting $32$ and then multiplying by $\\\\frac{5}{9}$. A simplified method may be used to produce a rough estimate: first subtract $30$ and then divide by $2$.
