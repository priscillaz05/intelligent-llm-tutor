"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"You are given a string text of words that are placed among some number of spaces. Each word consists of one or more lowercase English letters and are separated by at least one space. It's guaranteed that text contains at least one word.\\nRearrange the spaces so that there is an equal number of spaces between every pair of adjacent words and that number is maximized. If you cannot redistribute all the spaces equally, place the extra spaces at the end, meaning the returned string should be the same length as text.\\nReturn the string after rearranging the spaces.\\n\u00a0\\nExample 1:\\nInput: text = \\\"  this   is  a sentence \\\"\\nOutput: \\\"this   is   a   sentence\\\"\\nExplanation: There are a total of 9 spaces and 4 words. We can evenly divide the 9 spaces between the words: 9 / (4-1) = 3 spaces.\\n\\nExample 2:\\nInput: text = \\\" practice   makes   perfect\\\"\\nOutput: \\\"practice   makes   perfect \\\"\\nExplanation:\u00a0There are a total of 7 spaces and 3 words. 7 / (3-1) = 3 spaces plus 1 extra space. We place this extra space at the end of the string.\\n\\nExample 3:\\nInput: text = \\\"hello   world\\\"\\nOutput: \\\"hello   world\\\"\\n\\nExample 4:\\nInput: text = \\\"  walks  udp package   into  bar a\\\"\\nOutput: \\\"walks  udp  package  into  bar  a \\\"\\n\\nExample 5:\\nInput: text = \\\"a\\\"\\nOutput: \\\"a\\\"\\n\\n\u00a0\\nConstraints:\\n\\n1 <= text.length <= 100\\ntext\u00a0consists of lowercase English letters and\u00a0' '.\\ntext\u00a0contains at least one word.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"class Solution:\\n\\n\\tdef reorderSpaces(self, text: str) -> str:\\n\\t\\ts = text.split()\\n\\t\\tif len(s) == 1:\\n\\t\\t\\ttext = ''.join(s) + ' ' * text.count(' ')\\n\\t\\t\\treturn text\\n\\t\\tcount = text.count(' ') // (len(s) - 1)\\n\\t\\textra = text.count(' ') % (len(s) - 1)\\n\\t\\tresult = ''\\n\\t\\tnum = 0\\n\\t\\tfor c in s:\\n\\t\\t\\tresult += c\\n\\t\\t\\tnum += 1\\n\\t\\t\\tif num <= len(s) - 1:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresult += ' ' * count\\n\\t\\tqqqqqqqqq = [3] * 100000\\n\\t\\tif extra != 0:\\n\\t\\t\\tresult += ' ' * extra\\n\\t\\treturn result\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Extracting Words and Counting Spaces: First, extract all the words from the input string. Count the total number of spaces in the original string.\\n- Calculating Spaces Between Words: Determine the number of spaces that should be placed between each word to maximize the even distribution. Compute the spaces by dividing the total spaces by the number of gaps between words (number of words - 1).\\n- Handling Extra Spaces: If the total number of spaces cannot be evenly divided, calculate the number of extra spaces that will remain after the even distribution.\\n- Constructing the Result String: Build the result string by adding each word followed by the calculated number of spaces between words. Append the extra spaces to the end of the result string.\\n- Addressing Edge Cases: Consider the edge case where there's only one word in the string. In such cases, append all the original spaces to the end of the single word.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you extract the individual words from the input string, considering there may be multiple spaces between them?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the number of spaces to insert between each word, maximizing the even distribution of spaces?\",\n    \"What do you do with any remaining spaces after evenly distributing them between the words?\",\n    \"What is the edge case where there is only one word in the input string, and how does this influence the arrangement of spaces?\",\n    \"How would you ensure the solution maintains the same total length as the original input string when rearranging spaces?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"You can use the split() method on the string, which, by default, splits the string at each occurrence of whitespace, effectively extracting the words.\",\n    \"Divide the total number of spaces by the number of gaps between words (which is the number of words minus one) to calculate the spaces to insert between each word.\",\n    \"Append any remaining spaces to the end of the string after all the words and evenly distributed spaces have been added.\",\n    \"If there is only one word, append all the original spaces to the end of this word to fulfill the problem requirements.\",\n    \"The length will remain the same because the spaces are redistributed within the original string's length, moving spaces from between words to equal spacing and extra spaces at the end.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
