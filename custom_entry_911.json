If this number is unbounded, return -1.\\n- Identifying Key Conditions: The core condition is the substring check. The number 'i' represents how many times 't' is concatenated, and 'j' represents how many times 's' is concatenated. The goal is to find the largest 'i' for which there exists a 'j' where t * i is a substring of s * j.\\n- Edge Cases and Constraints: Consider the cases where either s or t is an empty string (though the constraints say they are not). Recognize that i=0 always satisfies the condition, since the empty string is a substring of every string. The constraints limit the lengths of s and t to 5 * 10^5.\\n- Choosing an Approach: A naive approach might involve generating concatenations of 't' and 's' and checking for substrings, but this is inefficient. A more efficient approach involves looking for a pattern in where 't' occurs within larger concatenated strings of 's'. The problem can be solved using Rolling Hash or KMP algorithm to efficiently determine if the concatenated string t*i is a substring of s*j for some j.\\n- Checking for Infinite Cases: If concatenations of 't' keep appearing within concatenations of 's', then the answer is -1. This happens when 't' is a substring of 's'.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for the number of valid 'i' values to be finite, and how would you determine if the number is infinite?\",\n    \"How does the condition that t*i must be a substring of s*j constrain the potential values of 'i'?\",\n    \"What is a Rolling Hash and how can it be used to solve substring search problem efficiently?\",\n    \"How would you handle the potentially large sizes of concatenated strings of s and t efficiently when searching for substrings?\",\n    \"What kind of pattern would indicate an infinite number of valid 'i' values, and how would you check for this pattern?\",\n    \"Is there another approach like KMP that can be used to find substring?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"If the number of valid 'i' values is finite, it means there's a maximum value of 'i' beyond which no further concatenations of 't' will be found as substrings of any number of concatenations of 's'. If the number is infinite, it means that no matter how many times you concatenate 't', it will always be a substring of some number of concatenations of 's'.\",\n    \"The condition implies that 't' must fit within 's' in some repeated manner. 'i' cannot be arbitrarily large if 't' does not 'align' well with 's', meaning some number of 't' concatenations would need to form part of another 's' concatenation.\",\n    \"Rolling Hash is a string algorithm that allows us to compute hash values for substring efficiently.

This can be checked by direct substring comparison. If true, then every concatenation of 't' is also a substring of some number of 's' concatenations.\",\n    \"Yes, KMP algorithm is another way to find substring, it relies on creating a LPS array\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
