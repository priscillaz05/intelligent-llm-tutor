'X' goes first.\\n- Identifying invalid board configurations: A board is invalid if 'O' wins when 'X' is supposed to make the first move, or if both players win simultaneously. Also if the number of 'X's is significantly different from the number of 'O's. More specifically, the number of 'X's can only be equal to or one greater than the number of 'O's.\\n- Assessing winning conditions: Check all possible winning rows, columns, and diagonals to see if either 'X' or 'O' has won.\\n- Checking move counts: Ensure the number of 'X's and 'O's on the board is consistent with the game's turn-based structure. Since X starts first, count of X should be equal to the count of O, or one greater than count of O.\\n- Combining checks: Evaluate the winning conditions along with move counts to determine overall board validity.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the conditions that make a Tic-Tac-Toe board invalid?\",\n    \"Given that X goes first, what are the valid combinations of X and O counts on the board?\",\n    \"How would you check if a player has won the game given a board state?\",\n    \"What specific scenarios might indicate an impossible or illegal state on the Tic-Tac-Toe board?\",\n    \"How does the order of moves in Tic-Tac-Toe constrain the possible board states?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A Tic-Tac-Toe board is invalid if both players have won, if the count of 'O' is greater than the count of 'X', if 'O' has won but 'X' made the first move or if the difference between the number of 'X's and 'O's is greater than 1 (X can be equal to O or one greater than O).
