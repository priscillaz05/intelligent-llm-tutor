The allowed moves can only add or subtract the coordinates from each other.  GCD(i, j) == GCD(i-j, j) == GCD(i, i-j) == GCD(i+j, j) == GCD(i, i+j).\\n- Deciding on an Algorithm: Calculate the GCD of (x, y) and (a, b). If they are the same, then it is possible to reach (a, b) from (x, y), otherwise, it is not possible.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Consider negative inputs using the absolute value function to avoid errors in the GCD calculation. Also, ensure to handle zero values correctly.
