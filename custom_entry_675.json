Special considerations include handling tied ranks, formatting the output string precisely, and calculating the Sonneborn-Berger score.\\n- Devising the Algorithm: The algorithm involves calculating points for each player, calculating the Sonneborn-Berger score, sorting players by points, SB score, and surname, and constructing the output string with specific formatting for each row and column. The first row needs to be constructed based on the size of the player list.\\n- Identifying Edge Cases and Constraints: Handle edge cases such as ties in points and SB score, formatting the output string based on the number of players, and accounting for different lengths of player names and score/SB values when formatting. Deal with `None` values in `results`. Ensure correct calculation of the SB score, considering that draws contribute half the opponent's score.\\n- Implementation Details: Implement the point and SB calculation. Implement player sorting. Create the output string with correct alignment and spacing. Account for single-digit vs. double-digit round numbers. Correctly determine tied rankings and display them. Handle the edge cases where there are two digits in round numbers but the ranking is still single digit numbers.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you handle the calculation of points and the Sonneborn-Berger score, especially considering draws and the structure of the `results` input?\",\n    \"What sorting criteria should be used to rank the players, and how would you implement the sorting logic, especially when there are ties?\",\n    \"How would you construct the output string to meet the specific formatting requirements, including column widths, alignment, and separators?\",\n    \"What are the key edge cases and constraints to consider, such as the number of players, ties in ranking, and handling `None` values in the `results`?\",\n    \"How should the rank column be generated and handle tied rankings, ensuring that players with the same score and SB score share the same rank and are ordered by surname?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"To calculate points, sum the results (1 for win, 0.5 for draw, 0 for loss, and treat None as 0) for each player. For the Sonneborn-Berger score, iterate through the results for each player. Add the full point score of each opponent the player defeated, and half the point score of each opponent the player drew against. Handle None results as 0 in calculating the SB score.\",\n    \"The primary sorting criterion is points in descending order. In case of ties, the Sonneborn-Berger score should be used as the secondary sorting criterion, also in descending order. If both points and SB score are tied, sort by surname in ascending order. Implement the sorting using a `sorted` function with a key that takes into account these three criteria.\",\n    \"Determine the maximum lengths of player names and scores to set column widths. Use string formatting (e.g., `ljust`, `rjust`, `center`) to align columns correctly. Insert two spaces between columns and a separator line consisting of `=` characters with the same length as the longest output line. Single-digit rounds should be separated by two spaces.\",\n    \"Edge cases include an empty player list (should return an empty table), players with the same score and SB score (should be ranked together), and `None` values in the results (should be treated as losses). The number of players determines the width of the columns, so ensure the formatting adjusts accordingly. Account for cases where the amount of players exceeds 10.\",\n    \"The rank column should start from 1. If two or more players have the same score and SB score, they should share the same rank. If a tie occurs, the rank of the next player should reflect the number of players ranked before them. Handle formatting the rank based on number of players. Order tied players by surname.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
