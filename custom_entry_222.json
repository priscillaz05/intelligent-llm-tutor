Pari reveals x % ci if Arya asks. Arya wins if knowing x % c1, ..., x % cn is sufficient to determine x % k, regardless of the value of x.\\n- Identifying Key Conditions for a Winning Strategy: Arya wins if and only if for every prime power p^a that divides k, there exists some ci such that p^a also divides ci. In other words, all the prime factors of k (raised to the power they appear in k's prime factorization) must also be factors of at least one of the ci's.\\n- Devising an Algorithm: Factorize k into prime powers. Iterate through the prime powers and check if each prime power divides at least one of the ancient numbers. If any prime power of k does not divide any of the ancient numbers, Arya loses. Otherwise, Arya wins.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: The case k = 1 should be handled separately, since x % 1 is always 0, Arya automatically knows the answer, so print \\\"Yes\\\".\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can we determine if Arya always knows the value of x % k irrespective of the value of x?\",\n    \"What condition must be met for Arya to be able to determine x % k, given that Pari reveals x % ci upon request?\",\n    \"How do we handle the scenario when k equals 1?\",\n    \"If k is factorized into prime powers, how does this relate to determining Arya's winning strategy?\",\n    \"Given a prime power p^a that divides k, what must be true about the ancient numbers for Arya to win?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Arya wins if knowing x % c1, ..., x % cn allows her to deduce x % k for any positive integer x.\",\n    \"For Arya to win, all prime powers in the factorization of k must also be factors of at least one of the ancient numbers.\",\n    \"If k equals 1, Arya automatically knows that x % k is 0, so she wins.\",\n    \"By factorizing k into prime powers, we can verify whether each of those prime powers divides at least one of the given numbers.\",\n    \"At least one of the ancient numbers ci must be divisible by p^a for each prime power p^a that divides k.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
