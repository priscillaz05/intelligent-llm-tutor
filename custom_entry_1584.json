For each a\u00b3, we check if n - a\u00b3 is also a perfect cube (b\u00b3). We then store the pairs (a, b) that satisfy a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 = n.  Finally, we check if we have at least two such pairs with all four numbers being different.\\n- Optimizing the Search: We can optimize the search by only considering cubes up to the cube root of n, and by ensuring a < b to avoid duplicate pairs and also n != 2*a^3.\\n- Verify Distinctness: Before counting the pairs, ensure that `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are all distinct. This needs to be checked implicitly using `n != 2 * c` in order to avoid generating duplicate `a` and `b` during the iterations.\\n- Counting Valid Solutions: The problem states sum > 3 instead of sum > 1 which means that each number can be equal to the sum of two cubes in at least two different ways.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the key constraints on the values of a, b, c, and d?\",\n    \"How would you optimize the search for pairs of cubes?\",\n    \"How do you verify that the pairs of numbers forming the cubes are distinct?\",\n    \"Why are we using sum > 3 in the final return instead of sum > 1 when we want two possible pairs of numbers?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The values of a, b, c, and d must be positive integers and all four must be different.\",\n    \"We can limit the search to cubes up to the cube root of n. Also, since a and b are interchangeable in sum, we only need to check a < b, to avoid duplicate pairs.\",\n    \"We check n != 2 * c to make sure we're not dealing with a case where both cubes are the same.\",\n    \"Because each pair with correct sum will increase the sum variable by 1 and the total possible pair is two, this means that the solution need to check a third loop to confirm whether or not the value is true.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
