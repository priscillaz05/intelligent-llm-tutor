"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"When little Petya grew up and entered the university, he started to take part in \\u0410\\u0421\\u041c contests. Later he realized that he doesn't like how the \\u0410\\u0421\\u041c contests are organised: the team could only have three members (and he couldn't take all his friends to the competitions and distribute the tasks between the team members efficiently), so he decided to organize his own contests PFAST Inc. \\u2014 Petr and Friends Are Solving Tasks Corporation. PFAST Inc. rules allow a team to have unlimited number of members.\\n\\nTo make this format of contests popular he organised his own tournament. To create the team he will prepare for the contest organised by the PFAST Inc. rules, he chose several volunteers (up to 16 people) and decided to compile a team from them. Petya understands perfectly that if a team has two people that don't get on well, then the team will perform poorly. Put together a team with as many players as possible given that all players should get on well with each other.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n (1 \\u2264 n \\u2264 16) \\u2014 the number of volunteers, and m (<image>) \\u2014 the number of pairs that do not get on. Next n lines contain the volunteers' names (each name is a non-empty string consisting of no more than 10 uppercase and/or lowercase Latin letters). Next m lines contain two names \\u2014 the names of the volunteers who do not get on. The names in pair are separated with a single space. Each pair of volunteers who do not get on occurs exactly once. The strings are case-sensitive. All n names are distinct.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nThe first output line should contain the single number k \\u2014 the number of people in the sought team. Next k lines should contain the names of the sought team's participants in the lexicographical order. If there are several variants to solve the problem, print any of them. Petya might not be a member of the sought team. \\n\\nExamples\\n\\nInput\\n\\n3 1\\nPetya\\nVasya\\nMasha\\nPetya Vasya\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n2\\nMasha\\nPetya\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n3 0\\nPasha\\nLesha\\nVanya\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n3\\nLesha\\nPasha\\nVanya\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"from sys import stdin, stdout\\nfrom collections import deque\\nimport sys\\nfrom copy import deepcopy\\nimport math\\nimport collections\\nfrom itertools import combinations\\n\\ndef check(temp):\\n\\tfor i in range(len(temp)):\\n\\t\\tfor j in range(i + 1, len(temp)):\\n\\t\\t\\tif temp[i] in enemy:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif temp[j] in enemy[temp[i]]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\treturn False\\n\\t\\t\\tif temp[j] in enemy:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif temp[i] in enemy[temp[j]]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\treturn False\\n\\treturn True\\n(n, m) = list(map(int, stdin.readline().split()))\\nname = dict()\\nback_name = dict()\\narr = []\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\tstring = stdin.readline().strip()\\n\\tname[string] = i\\n\\tback_name[i] = string\\nenemy = collections.defaultdict(dict)\\nfor i in range(m):\\n\\t(first, second) = list(stdin.readline().split())\\n\\tenemy[name[first]][name[second]] = True\\n\\tenemy[name[second]][name[first]] = True\\narr = [x for x in range(n)]\\nans = []\\nnum = 0\\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\\n\\tcomb = combinations(arr, i)\\n\\tfor i in comb:\\n\\t\\ttemp = list(i)\\n\\t\\tif check(temp):\\n\\t\\t\\tif len(temp) > num:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tans = temp\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnum = len(temp)\\nprint(len(ans))\\nans2 = []\\nfor i in ans:\\n\\tans2.append(back_name[i])\\nans2.sort()\\nfor i in ans2:\\n\\tprint(i)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The goal is to find the largest possible team from a group of volunteers, given a list of pairs who don't get along. The team must be such that no two members of the team are in the \\\"don't get along\\\" list.\\n- Data Structures: A dictionary or hashmap is used to store the volunteers' names and assign a unique integer to each volunteer for easier processing. Another dictionary or hashmap is used to store the \\\"don't get along\\\" relationships.\\n- Algorithm Selection: The problem can be solved using a brute-force approach since the number of volunteers is small (up to 16). The algorithm iterates through all possible combinations of volunteers and checks if each combination forms a valid team.\\n- Checking Team Validity: For each combination, the algorithm checks if any two volunteers in the team don't get along. If the team is valid, it compares the size of the team with the current maximum team size and updates the maximum team size and the corresponding team members if necessary.\\n- Lexicographical Ordering: After finding the largest valid team, the names of the team members are sorted in lexicographical order before printing the result.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you represent the 'don't get along' relationships between the volunteers in a way that allows efficient checking?\",\n    \"Since the number of volunteers is limited, can a brute-force approach be effective, and what are the time complexity considerations?\",\n    \"How can you ensure that the output team members are printed in lexicographical order?\",\n    \"What data structure is best suited to store volunteer names and quickly retrieve their index or related data?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases or constraints in the input that may influence your code's correctness or efficiency?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"You can use a dictionary where the keys are volunteer names (or their assigned integers), and the values are sets containing the names (or integers) of the volunteers they don't get along with. This allows for fast lookups to check if two volunteers don't get along.\",\n    \"Yes, a brute-force approach is feasible because the number of volunteers is at most 16. The time complexity would be O(2^n * n^2) where n is the number of volunteers because we need to iterate through all possible subsets (2^n) and then check each pair of members (n^2).\",\n    \"After finding the largest team, you can sort the names of the team members alphabetically before printing them.\",\n    \"Dictionaries (or hashmaps) are ideal for storing volunteer names and associating them with an index or other relevant data (e.g., a boolean indicating team membership). Dictionaries provide O(1) average-case time complexity for lookups, which is important for checking 'don't get along' relationships.\",\n    \"The number of volunteers is between 1 and 16. The names are case-sensitive and can be up to 10 characters long. All volunteer names are distinct. The input format needs to be strictly adhered to when parsing the data. If m = 0, any combination can be a team.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
