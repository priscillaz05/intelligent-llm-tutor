The given constraints specify a lower bound of 1 for N, so an empty matrix is not a concern.  Handle rectangular matrices gracefully even if the prompt specified square matrices.\\n- Choosing a Traversal Strategy: The core is to iterate through diagonals. Diagonals can be identified by the sum of their row and column indices (i + j). Elements with the same sum belong to the same diagonal.  Consider using a list of lists to store the elements of each diagonal.\\n- Diagonal Ordering: Notice that within each diagonal, the order of elements alternates based on whether the diagonal's index (i+j) is even or odd. For even sums, insert the element at the beginning of the diagonal's list; for odd sums, append it to the end.\\n- Final Result Construction: After processing all elements, concatenate all the sublists representing diagonals into a single result list.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does the sum of row and column indices relate to the diagonals of the matrix, and why is this important?\",\n    \"What is the order of elements within each diagonal, and how can you determine if the order should be reversed?\",\n    \"How would you initialize the list of lists to store the elements of each diagonal?\",\n    \"After storing the diagonal elements, how would you construct the final result list containing all the elements in the correct diagonal order?\",\n    \"What is the time and space complexity of this solution, and how do they relate to the problem constraints?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The sum of the row and column indices is constant for all elements within a diagonal. This property allows us to group elements belonging to the same diagonal, which is important for diagonal traversal.\",\n    \"Within each diagonal, elements are either added from top-right to bottom-left, or vice versa. If the diagonal sum (i+j) is even, we insert elements at the beginning. If the sum is odd, we append elements at the end of list representing diagonal.\",\n    \"You initialize a list of lists with size n + m - 1.  Each sublist will represent a diagonal and initially be empty.\",\n    \"Iterate through the list of lists containing diagonal elements and concatenate sublists into single list.\",\n    \"The time complexity is O(N*M) because we iterate through each element of the matrix once.  The space complexity is O(N+M) in the worst case to store diagonal sublists because there are N+M-1 diagonals in a matrix of size N * M, even though it is O(1) auxiliary space.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
