The values 31 and 224 can be obtained with powers of 2, and the given solution provides the formula to compute p and q.\\n- Calculating the Numerator and Denominator: The code calculates the numerator as p - 1, where p = 2**(m+n). The denominator is calculated as p * (q - 1), where q = 2**n. Therefore, we are looking at a series which yields the sum (2**(m+n) - 1) / (2**(m+n) * (2**n - 1)).\\n- Implementing the Solution: Given m and n, calculate p and q, and then compute and print the result as a string in the form \\\"p/q\\\".\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What series are we summing, and how are the numerator and denominator derived based on m and n?\",\n    \"How do the constraints on m and n affect the solution, particularly with regards to potential overflow issues when calculating large powers of 2?\",\n    \"Can you simplify the resulting fraction, and would simplification be necessary given the constraints?\",\n    \"How is the number of test cases handled in the provided solution?\",\n    \"What are the possible edge cases, and how are they addressed within the given code snippet?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The series produces a sum of (2**(m+n) - 1) / (2**(m+n) * (2**n - 1)).
