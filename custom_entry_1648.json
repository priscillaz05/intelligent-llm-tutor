In order to train, he has decided that he'll first jump by only one unit, and each subsequent jump will be exactly one longer than the previous one. He can go either left or right with each jump. He wonders how many jumps he needs to reach x.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe input data consists of only one integer x ( - 109 \u2264 x \u2264 109).\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nOutput the minimal number of jumps that Jack requires to reach x.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nInput\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n0\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"from math import sqrt\\nx = abs(int(input()))\\nn = int((sqrt(1 + 8 * x) - 1) / 2)\\nk = n * (n + 1) // 2\\nif k == x:\\n\\tprint(n)\\nelse:\\n\\tn += 1\\n\\tk += n\\n\\tif (k - x) % 2:\\n\\t\\tn += 1\\n\\t\\tk += n\\n\\t\\tprint(n + (k - x) % 2)\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tprint(n)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires finding the minimum number of jumps to reach a target x, where each jump increases by one unit, and the direction of each jump can be either left or right.\\n- Mathematical Formulation: The sum of the first n natural numbers is n*(n+1)/2. We need to find the smallest n such that this sum, with appropriate sign changes for each term in the sum, equals x.\\n- Identifying Key Considerations: The absolute value of x is the most important factor. The difference between the sum of jumps and x must be even. If it is odd, we increment n until it is even.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: The process starts by calculating the sum k = n*(n+1)/2, where n is the smallest integer to be closed to the square root, check whether k == abs(x), if it is then print n. If it's not, increase n and recalculate sum, k += n, then check if (k-abs(x)) % 2. if yes, then we know that we need one more jump to be able to get (k-abs(x)) % 2 is 0, then print n+1\\n\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you handle negative values of x? Should you consider absolute value?\",\n    \"How do you efficiently find the smallest n such that the sum of the first n natural numbers, with possible sign changes, equals x?\",\n    \"Why is it crucial for the difference between the sum of jumps and x to be an even number?\",\n    \"How does the fact that jumps can be either left or right affect the calculation of the number of jumps?\",\n    \"Are there any specific constraints on the range of x that might influence the solution or require special handling?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Since you can jump in either direction, the sign of x does not change the minimal number of jumps needed. Taking the absolute value of x simplifies the calculation.\",\n    \"Start by finding the smallest n such that n*(n+1)/2 is greater than or equal to the absolute value of x. You can use the square root to find a good starting point for n.\",\n    \"Because any left-right switch changes the cumulative sum by an even number. If the difference between the sum and x is odd, an even number of additional jumps is required.\",\n    \"The ability to jump left or right means that any difference between the current sum and the target x can be adjusted by strategically choosing the direction of the jumps.\",\n    \"The range of x (-10^9 to 10^9) suggests that you may need to handle large numbers, so efficiency is essential. Using appropriate data types for n and the sum k is also necessary.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
