The magician has one ball and three cups, he shows Ronny which cup he hides the ball under (b), he then mixes all the cups around by performing multiple two-cup switches (arr). Ronny can record the switches but can't work out where the ball is. Write a programme to help him do this. \\n\\nRules: \\n- There will only ever be three cups.\\n- Only two cups will be swapped at a time. \\n- The cups and their switches will be refered to by their index in a row of three, beginning at one. So [[1,2]] means the cup at position one, is swapped with the cup at position two. \\n- Arr will be an array of integers 1 - 3 organised in pairs. \\n- There won't be any empty sub-arrays.\\n- If arr is just an empty array b should be returned.\\n\\nExamples: \\n\\n(b) = 2, \\n(arr) = [[1,2]]\\n\\nThe ball is under cup number : 1\\n\\n-------\\n\\n(b) = 1, \\n(arr) = [[2,3],[1,2],[1,2]]\\n\\nThe ball is under cup number : 1\\n\\n-------\\n\\n(b) = 2, \\n(arr) = [[1,3],[1,2],[2,1],[2,3]]\\n\\nThe ball is under cup number : 3\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"from functools import reduce\\n\\ndef cup_and_balls(b, arr):\\n\\treturn reduce(lambda x, y: y[1] if x == y[0] else y[0] if x == y[1] else x, arr, b)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem describes a cups and balls magic trick where the goal is to track the location of the ball after a series of cup swaps. The initial location of the ball and the sequence of swaps are provided as input.\\n- Devising a Plan: The core idea is to simulate the cup swaps and update the ball's location accordingly. The function needs to iterate through the list of swaps and check if the current location of the ball is involved in the swap. If so, the location is updated to the other cup in the swap.\\n- Edge Cases and Constraints: The problem states that there are always three cups and only two cups are swapped at a time. Also, the cups are referenced by their index (1-3). If the array of switches is empty, then the initial ball location should be returned. The swaps are provided as pairs of integers within subarrays.\\n- Implementation Details: For each swap, compare the current ball position with both cup indices in the swap. If the ball is at cup 'x', it gets swapped with cup 'y'.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you represent the cups and the initial position of the ball?\",\n    \"How would you iterate through the list of swaps and update the ball's position?\",\n    \"What happens if the ball's current position is not involved in any of the swaps?\",\n    \"What data type is best to use for the cup positions?\",\n    \"How would you handle the edge case where the array of swaps is empty?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The cups can be represented implicitly using the ball's position which is just an integer (1, 2, or 3).\",\n    \"You would iterate through each subarray of the swaps array. For each swap, check if the current ball position is equal to either of the cups being swapped. If it is, update the ball position to the other cup number.\",\n    \"If the ball's position is not involved in a swap, its position remains unchanged for that particular swap.\",\n    \"Integers are best suited because cups are referenced by their index.\",\n    \"If the array of swaps is empty, the function should simply return the initial ball position.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
