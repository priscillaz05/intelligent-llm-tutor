For example, $\\\\textbf{GACT}$ and $\\\\textbf{AAGTGCCT}$ are both steady genes.\\n\\nBear Limak is a famous biotechnology scientist who specializes in modifying bear DNA to make it steady.  Right now, he is examining a gene represented as a string $\\\\textit{gene}$.  It is not necessarily steady.  Fortunately, Limak can choose one (maybe empty) substring of $\\\\textit{gene}$ and replace it with any string of the same length.\\n\\nModifying a large substring of bear genes can be dangerous.\\nGiven a string $\\\\textit{gene}$, can you help Limak find the length of the smallest possible substring that he can replace to make $\\\\textit{gene}$ a steady gene?\\n\\nNote: A substring of a string $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mathrm{~S~}}$ is a subsequence made up of zero or more contiguous characters of $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mathrm{~S~}}$.\\n\\nAs an example, consider $\\\\textit{gene}=\\\\textit{ACTGAAAG}$.  The substring $\\\\boldsymbol{AA}$ just before or after $\\\\mbox{G}$ can be replaced with $\\\\textit{CT}$ or $\\\\boldsymbol{TC}$.

A steady gene has an equal number (n/4) of each of the four characters (A, C, T, G).\\n- Identifying Key Strategies: The main idea is to find a substring such that replacing it will result in a balanced gene. This could involve counting the occurrences of each character and then using a sliding window to identify the smallest substring that needs to be changed. A brute-force solution would likely be too slow given the constraints.\\n- Optimizing the Solution: The sliding window approach can significantly improve efficiency. Start by counting how many characters exceed the required n/4 amount. Then, use a sliding window to find the smallest substring that contains at least the excess amount of each character.  This approach avoids checking every possible substring, making it more efficient.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for a gene to be 'steady', and what are the implications for the occurrences of each character?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently count the occurrences of each character in the gene?\",\n    \"How can you identify which characters are over-represented and how much excess of each exists?\",\n    \"How can a sliding window technique be used to identify the smallest substring that needs to be replaced?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases to consider, such as when the gene is already steady or when no substring needs to be replaced?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A 'steady' gene has an equal number of occurrences of each of the four characters (A, C, T, G), specifically n/4 occurrences of each.\",\n    \"Use a dictionary or a counter object to store the number of times each character appears in the string. Iterate through the string, updating the counts for each character as you go.\",\n    \"After counting the occurrences of each character, compare each count to n/4. The difference between the count and n/4 is the excess.  If a count is less than n/4, there is no excess for that character.\",\n    \"Use a sliding window to traverse the gene string. Expand the window until it contains at least the excess amount of each over-represented character. Then, shrink the window from the left until it no longer satisfies this condition. Track the minimum window size found during this process.\",\n    \"If the gene is already steady, the answer is 0. If the initial counts reveal no excess of any character, return 0. If no substring can be found that contains the excess characters, then an appropriate action, like returning the length of the gene, needs to be taken.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
