The ranges are given as input, and multiple queries for different values of K need to be processed.\\n- Handling Overlapping Ranges: The ranges might overlap, so they need to be merged to avoid duplicates and create a consolidated set of ranges. The ranges also need to be sorted to ensure the numbers are arranged in increasing order.\\n- Efficiently Finding the Kth Smallest: For each query, the code needs to efficiently traverse the merged ranges and find the Kth smallest number. If K is larger than the total number of elements in all ranges, it needs to return -1.\\n- Edge Cases: The code needs to handle edge cases like when K is greater than the number of elements, or when the input ranges are empty.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How should the overlapping ranges be merged so that duplicate numbers are not considered?\",\n    \"How should the given ranges be processed to combine them and arrange them in increasing order?\",\n    \"How to efficiently find the Kth smallest number given the merged ranges?\",\n    \"What edge cases must be considered and how they should be handled?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Overlapping ranges can be merged by sorting the ranges and then iterating through them. If the current range overlaps with the previous merged range, extend the previous range to the maximum end point. Otherwise, add the current range as a new merged range. This will consolidate the ranges without duplicates.\",\n    \"First, sort the given ranges. Then, iterate through the sorted ranges. Maintain a list of merged ranges.

Subtract the number of elements in each range from K until K becomes less than or equal to the number of elements in the current range.
