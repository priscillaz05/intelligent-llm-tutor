The solution must operate within O(N) time complexity and O(1) space complexity, implying an in-place or single-pass approach.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Consider edge cases such as an empty array or an array with only one element. Be mindful of potential integer overflow when summing very large positive and negative numbers.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Since we are aiming for O(N) time complexity, sorting is not optimal (typically O(N log N)). We need to find the min and max in a single pass. Iterate through the array, maintaining current min and max values.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Initialize the minimum and maximum variables appropriately (e.g., with the first element of the array or with the maximum and minimum possible integer values, respectively).\\n\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the most efficient approach to find both the minimum and maximum elements in an array within the given time and space constraints?\",\n    \"How would you initialize your minimum and maximum values to handle both positive and negative numbers efficiently?\",\n    \"What edge cases should be considered, and how would they affect your implementation?\",\n    \"Given that the array can contain both large positive and negative numbers, how would you handle potential integer overflow when calculating the sum?\",\n    \"Can you describe a step-by-step approach to iterate through the array while updating the minimum and maximum values at each step?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The most efficient approach is to iterate through the array once, keeping track of the current minimum and maximum values encountered. This achieves O(N) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.\",\n    \"Initialize the minimum and maximum values with the first element of the array. This avoids issues with positive/negative bias and ensures proper comparison from the start.\",\n    \"Consider an empty array. In that case, you might return 0 or raise an exception, depending on the problem definition. A single element array will have that single element as both min and max.\",\n    \"Integer overflow could occur if the absolute values of the minimum and maximum are very large. Use a larger data type (e.g., long) to store the sum if necessary.\",\n    \"Start by assuming the first element is both the minimum and maximum. Then, iterate through the rest of the array, comparing each element with the current minimum and maximum. If an element is less than the current minimum, update the minimum.
