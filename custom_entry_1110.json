He wants to become a member of Bamokh's team. In order to join he was given some programming tasks and one week to solve them. Mashmokh is not a very experienced programmer. Actually he is not a programmer at all. So he wasn't able to solve them. That's why he asked you to help him with these tasks. One of these tasks is the following.\\n\\nA sequence of l integers b1, b2, ..., bl (1 \u2264 b1 \u2264 b2 \u2264 ... \u2264 bl \u2264 n) is called good if each number divides (without a remainder) by the next number in the sequence. More formally <image> for all i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 l - 1).\\n\\nGiven n and k find the number of good sequences of length k. As the answer can be rather large print it modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n, k (1 \u2264 n, k \u2264 2000).\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nOutput a single integer \u2014 the number of good sequences of length k modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nInput\\n\\n3 2\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n6 4\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n39\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n2 1\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n2\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import math\\n\\ndef C(n, k):\\n\\tw = 1\\n\\tfor i in range(n - k + 1, n + 1):\\n\\t\\tw *= i\\n\\tfor i in range(1, k + 1):\\n\\t\\tw //= i\\n\\treturn w\\n\\ndef multiples(limit):\\n\\ttmp = 1\\n\\tm = limit\\n\\tfor j in range(2, limit + 1):\\n\\t\\tno_multiples = 0\\n\\t\\twhile m % j == 0:\\n\\t\\t\\tno_multiples += 1\\n\\t\\t\\tm //= j\\n\\t\\tif no_multiples:\\n\\t\\t\\ttmp *= C(no_multiples + k - 1, no_multiples)\\n\\treturn tmp\\n(n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]\\nmodulo = 1000000007\\ntotal = 0\\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\\n\\ttotal += multiples(i)\\nprint(total % modulo)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem asks to find the number of \\\"good\\\" sequences of length `k` where each element divides the next, and the elements are between 1 and `n`. The result should be modulo 1000000007.\\n- Defining a Good Sequence: A sequence `b1, b2, ..., bk` is good if `b1 <= b2 <= ... <= bk <= n` and `bi` divides `bi+1` for all `i` from 1 to `k-1`.\\n- Choosing an Approach: Dynamic programming seems appropriate here. We can build a table `dp[i][j]` representing the number of good sequences of length `i` ending with the number `j`. Then, we can iterate through possible values for the last element and sum up the results.\\n- Handling Modulo: Ensure that every calculation is done modulo 1000000007 to avoid integer overflow.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the base case for the dynamic programming approach, i.e., when the sequence length is 1?\",\n    \"How would you formulate the recursive relation for calculating dp[i][j], given dp[i-1][x] for all x that divide j?\",\n    \"How do you ensure that the values in the dp table do not exceed the modulo value (1000000007)?\",\n    \"What is the time complexity of your dynamic programming approach, given that n and k are up to 2000?\",\n    \"How do you compute the final answer from the filled dp table?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"When the sequence length is 1, the base case is dp[1][j] = 1 for all `j` from 1 to `n`, because any single number forms a good sequence of length 1.\",\n    \"The recursive relation is dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i-1][x]) for all `x` such that `j % x == 0` and `1 <= x <= j`. We are summing up the number of sequences of length `i-1` that can be extended by adding `j`.\",\n    \"After each addition or multiplication, we need to take the modulo to keep the values within the required range: `dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i-1][x]) % 1000000007`.\",\n    \"The time complexity is O(n^2 * k) because we have three nested loops: one for the sequence length (up to `k`), one for the last element of the sequence (up to `n`), and one for finding divisors of the last element (up to `n` in the worst case).\",\n    \"The final answer is the sum of all dp[k][j] for `j` from 1 to `n`, taken modulo 1000000007. It is the total number of good sequences of length `k` ending with any number up to `n`.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
