Unfortunately he lives in a monochrome world, where everything is of the same color and only saturation differs. This pack can be represented as a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} of n integer numbers \u2014 saturation of the color of each pencil. Now Mishka wants to put all the mess in the pack in order. He has an infinite number of empty boxes to do this. He would like to fill some boxes in such a way that:\\n\\n  Each pencil belongs to exactly one box;  Each non-empty box has at least k pencils in it;  If pencils i and j belong to the same box, then |a_{i} - a_{j}| \u2264 d, where |x| means absolute value of x. Note that the opposite is optional, there can be pencils i and j such that |a_{i} - a_{j}| \u2264 d and they belong to different boxes. \\n\\nHelp Mishka to determine if it's possible to distribute all the pencils into boxes.

And you also can put all the pencils into the same box, difference of any pair in it won't exceed 10.\\n\\nIn the second example you can split pencils of saturations [4, 5, 3, 4] into 2 boxes of size 2 and put the remaining ones into another box.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import sys, math, queue\\nMOD = 998244353\\nsys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)\\n\\ndef check(i):\\n\\tif not dp[i][2]:\\n\\t\\treturn False\\n\\tif i < 0:\\n\\t\\treturn True\\n\\treturn check(i - dp[i][1])\\n(n, k, d) = map(int, input().split())\\nif k == 1:\\n\\tprint('YES')\\n\\treturn\\na = sorted(map(int, input().split()))\\ndp = [None for i in range(n)]\\ndp[0] = (a[0], 1, False)\\nfor i in range(1, n):\\n\\tif a[i] - dp[i - 1][0] <= d:\\n\\t\\tdp[i] = (dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][1] + 1, dp[i - 1][1] + 1 >= k)\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tdp[i] = (a[i], 1, False)\\n\\t\\tj = i\\n\\t\\twhile a[i] - a[j] <= d and j > 0:\\n\\t\\t\\tj -= 1\\n\\t\\t\\tif dp[j][2]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdp[i] = (a[j + 1], i - j, i - j >= k)\\n\\t\\t\\tif dp[i][2]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbreak\\nprint('YES' if check(n - 1) else 'NO')\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the problem: The problem requires determining if a given set of pencils with varying saturations can be distributed into boxes satisfying two conditions: each box has at least k pencils, and the maximum difference in saturation between any two pencils in the same box is no more than d.\\n- Sorting the array: Sort the input array of saturation values. This facilitates checking the difference constraint within a potential box.\\n- Dynamic programming approach: Use dynamic programming to determine if a prefix of the sorted array can be divided into valid boxes.  dp[i] stores whether the first i+1 pencils can be arranged into valid boxes.\\n- DP transition: For each i, either the i-th pencil starts a new box, or it is added to a preceding valid box. Iterate through possible starting points j to check if pencils from j to i can form a valid box (size at least k, and saturation difference <= d).\\n- Base case: Initialize the base case. The first i elements form a valid box if i+1 >= k and a[i] - a[0] <= d. This means if k=1, the whole array can be divided into boxes of size 1.\\n- Checking the final result: After computing the DP table, check if the entire array can be distributed, which is dp[n-1].\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the constraints on the number of pencils in each box, and the saturation differences within a box?\",\n    \"Why is it beneficial to sort the array of pencil saturations?\",\n    \"How can dynamic programming be used to determine if a prefix of the array can be divided into valid boxes?\",\n    \"What is the DP transition, and how are the validity conditions checked at each step?\",\n    \"What are the base cases for the dynamic programming approach?\",\n    \"What is the meaning of the final DP result in the context of the original problem?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Each non-empty box must contain at least k pencils, and the absolute difference in saturation between any two pencils in the same box must be no more than d.\",\n    \"Sorting the array makes it easier to check the saturation difference constraint because we only need to consider consecutive elements in a potential box.\",\n    \"Dynamic programming allows us to build a solution incrementally.  dp[i] can represent whether the first i pencils can be arranged in valid boxes. \",\n    \"The DP transition involves either starting a new box with the i-th pencil or adding it to a previous box. We check that the number of pencils in the box is at least k and that the difference in saturation between the most and least saturated pencils in the box does not exceed d.
