Understand that a player wins by having three of their symbols (either 'o' or 'x') in a row, column, or diagonal.\\n- Data Representation: Note that the input is a string of 9 characters representing the board state. The characters are 'o', 'x', and 's' (for blank).\\n- Identifying Winning Conditions: Enumerate all possible winning combinations (rows, columns, and diagonals).  Store these combinations for checking.\\n- Checking for a Winner: Iterate through each winning combination and check if all three positions in that combination are occupied by the same symbol ('o' or 'x').\\n- Determining the Outcome: If a winner is found, output the winning symbol. If no winner is found after checking all combinations, output 'd' for draw.\\n- Input Handling: Process multiple datasets until an EOFError is encountered.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How are the Tic-Tac-Toe board positions represented in the input string?\",\n    \"What are all the possible winning combinations (rows, columns, diagonals) in a 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe board?\",\n    \"How do you determine if a player has won based on a given board state?\",\n    \"What conditions signify a draw in the Tic-Tac-Toe game according to the problem?\",\n    \"How should the program handle multiple game board inputs?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The board is represented by a string of 9 characters ('o', 'x', or 's') arranged in row-major order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom).\",\n    \"Winning combinations are the horizontal rows (012, 345, 678), vertical columns (036, 147, 258), and diagonals (048, 246).\",\n    \"A player wins if any of the winning combinations contains only their symbol ('o' or 'x').
