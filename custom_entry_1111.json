"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"Jack and Jill got into a serious fight. Jack didn't not belive Jill when she said that her memory was far better than the others. He asked her to prove it as follows :- \\n\\n-  Jack would dictate a long list of numbers to her. At any point after he has dictated  at least \\\"k\\\" numbers, he can ask her what is the k-th minimum number (the k-th number if the numbers are arranged in increasing order) in the list so far. \\n-  She succeeds in proving herself if she can tell the k-th minimum number every time he asks. \\n-  The number of queries (dictate a new number or ask her the k-th minimum of the numbers given till then) has to be pre-decided before he starts asking. \\n\\nJill succeeded in proving herself by convincing Jack quite a few times. Now, Jill remembered that Jack had claimed that he was good at programming. It's her turn to ask him to prove his skill. Jack doesn't want to lose to her and comes to you for help. He asks you to make the program for him. \\n\\n-----Input-----\\nJill has agreed to let Jack decide the format of the input and here's what he has decided. First line of the input contains n, the number of queries. Next line contains k. Next n lines contain a query each, say q. If  q >= 0  then the number is being 'dictated' to the system and needs to be remembered. If q = -1, then your program should return the k-th minimum number presented so far . It is given that 'q' can be -1 only if at least k numbers have already been given.\\n\\n-----Output-----\\nFor every q = -1, you have to output the k-th minimum number given as input so far (not counting -1 as an input)\\n\\n-----Example-----\\nInput1:\\n6\\n2\\n3\\n2\\n-1\\n-1\\n1\\n-1\\n\\nOutput1:\\n3\\n3\\n2\\n\\nInput2:\\n10\\n5\\n3\\n6\\n1\\n4\\n2\\n9\\n3\\n1\\n0\\n-1\\n\\nOutput2:\\n3\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import operator\\nN = eval(input())\\nN = int(N)\\nk = eval(input())\\nk = int(k)\\nlist = []\\nfor i in range(k):\\n\\ta = eval(input())\\n\\ta = int(a)\\n\\tlist.append(a)\\nlist.sort()\\nfor i in range(k, N):\\n\\ta = eval(input())\\n\\ta = int(a)\\n\\tif a >= 0:\\n\\t\\tif a < list[k - 1]:\\n\\t\\t\\tlist.pop()\\n\\t\\t\\tlist.append(a)\\n\\t\\t\\tlist.sort()\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tprint(list[k - 1])\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem asks to simulate a scenario where a program receives numbers and must be able to output the k-th smallest number seen so far when queried. The number of inputs and the value of k are provided upfront.\\n- Data Structures Selection: A sorted list would be appropriate since we need to efficiently find the k-th smallest element after each new number is added.\\n- Algorithm Selection: The initial k numbers are added to the list and sorted. For subsequent numbers, if the new number is non-negative, it is potentially added to the list. If the number is smaller than the current k-th smallest (last element of the list), the last element is removed and the new number is inserted, and the list is re-sorted. If the number is -1, output the k-th smallest element (last element in the list).\\n- Optimization: Only re-sort if a smaller element is found, which is critical for performance.\\n- Edge Case Handling: No specific edge cases need special attention as the problem states that queries for the k-th minimum will only happen after at least k elements have been provided.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How should you store the input numbers to efficiently find the k-th smallest number at any given time?\",\n    \"How can you determine if a new number needs to be added to the list of the k smallest numbers seen so far?\",\n    \"How should you handle the '-1' query to provide the correct output?\",\n    \"Given the input is read line by line, how can you manage the list of numbers and update it dynamically?\",\n    \"What is the role of the initial k numbers, and how are they processed differently from the subsequent numbers?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A sorted list is a suitable data structure as it allows efficient retrieval of the k-th smallest element.\",\n    \"A new number should be added if it is non-negative and less than the current k-th smallest number in the list.\",\n    \"When encountering a '-1' query, output the k-th smallest number in the list, which is the element at index k-1.\",\n    \"Read the inputs sequentially, add the initial k inputs to the list and sort them. Subsequently, check each new number and update the list if needed.\",\n    \"The initial k numbers are used to populate the list with the first k smallest numbers, which must be sorted initially to determine the starting k-th smallest element.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
