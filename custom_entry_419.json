A crucial requirement is the ability to retrieve the minimum element present in the stack in O(1) time complexity.\\n- Analyzing Data Structures: Explore how the inherent LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) nature of a stack can be maintained while ensuring that the minimum element can be accessed instantly.\\n- Selecting an Appropriate Algorithm: A common strategy involves storing the minimum element along with the stack. Consider how to update this minimum element during push and pop operations.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Identify scenarios such as when the stack is empty. Handle how the stack should behave when asked to pop from an empty stack or find the minimum element in an empty stack.\\n- Designing the push and pop methods: Determine how the push operation will update the stack while simultaneously tracking the minimum element, and how the pop operation will correctly remove elements and update the minimum element. Consider using a variable to keep track of the current minimum.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does O(1) time complexity mean for the getMin operation, and why is this a key constraint for the problem?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: \\\"O(1) time complexity means that the getMin operation should take a constant amount of time, regardless of the number of elements in the stack. This constraint requires us to store or compute the minimum element without iterating through the stack.\\\"\",\n    \"How can you keep track of the minimum element as elements are pushed onto the stack, and how will you update it?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: \\\"I can maintain an additional variable that stores the current minimum element. On each push operation, I'll compare the new element with the current minimum. If the new element is smaller, I'll update the minimum.
