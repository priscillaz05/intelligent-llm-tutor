Since we are only concerned with the last digit, we only need to consider the last digit of the bases.\\n- Identifying Optimization Techniques: Recognize that the last digit of a number raised to a power repeats in a cycle of length at most 4. Therefore, only the value of exponents mod 4 is important. If exponent mod 4 is 0, treat is as 4.\\n- Implementation Details: Reduce each base and exponent modulo 10 and 4 respectively. Be sure to handle the special case when the exponent modulo 4 is 0.\\n- Combining the Results: Multiply these last digits together, and take the result modulo 10 to find the last digit of the entire product.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Why do we only need to consider the last digit of the bases (a, c, e)?\",\n    \"Why can the exponents (b, d, f) be reduced modulo 4?\",\n    \"What needs to be considered if an exponent after the modulo operation is 0?\",\n    \"How do you combine the individual results to get the final last digit?\",\n    \"What is the time complexity of the given solution and why?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Because only the last digit of each number in the equation contributes to the last digit of the entire result.\",\n    \"Because the last digits of powers repeat in a cycle of at most 4, meaning a^{b} has the same last digit as a^{b%4}.\",\n    \"Since the pattern repeats every 4 values, the result of x%4 will result in a zero if x is a multiple of 4. If the result of the mod is zero then assign that zero to a 4. If we didn't do this the program would provide incorrect results when the exponent is a multiple of 4.\",\n    \"Multiply the results of (a % 10) ** (b % 4), (c % 10) ** (d % 4), and (e % 10) ** (f % 4), and then take the modulo 10 of the product to obtain the last digit.\",\n    \"The time complexity is O(1) because the modulo operator and exponentiation are constant-time operations.
