All the processes have a unique number assigned to them from 1 to N. \\n\\nNow, you are given two things:\\nThe calling order in which all the processes are called. \\nThe ideal order in which all the processes should have been executed. \\n\\nNow, let us demonstrate this by an example. Let's say that there are 3 processes, the calling order of the processes is: 3 - 2 - 1. The ideal order is: 1 - 3 - 2, i.e., process number 3 will only be executed after process number 1 has been completed; process number 2 will only be executed after process number 3 has been executed.\\n\\nIteration #1: Since the ideal order has process #1 to be executed firstly, the calling ordered is changed, i.e., the first element has to be pushed to the last place. Changing the position of the element takes 1 unit of time. The new calling order is: 2 - 1 - 3. Time taken in step #1: 1.\\n\\nIteration #2: Since the ideal order has process #1 to be executed firstly, the calling ordered has to be changed again, i.e., the first element has to be pushed to the last place. The new calling order is: 1 - 3 - 2. Time taken in step #2: 1.\\n\\nIteration #3: Since the first element of the calling order is same as the ideal order, that process will be executed. And it will be thus popped out. Time taken in step #3: 1.\\n\\nIteration #4: Since the new first element of the calling order is same as the ideal order, that process will be executed. Time taken in step #4: 1.\\n\\nIteration #5: Since the last element of the calling order is same as the ideal order, that process will be executed. Time taken in step #5: 1.\\n\\nTotal time taken: 5 units.\\n\\nPS: Executing a process takes 1 unit of time.  Changing the position takes 1 unit of time.\\n\\nInput format:\\nThe first line a number N, denoting the number of processes. The second line contains the calling order of the processes. The third line contains the ideal order of the processes.\\n\\nOutput format:\\nPrint the total time taken for the entire queue of processes to be executed. \\n\\nConstraints: \\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 100  \\n\\nSAMPLE INPUT\\n3\\n3 2 1\\n1 3 2\\n\\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\\n5\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"'''\\n# Read input from stdin and provide input before running code\\n\\nname = raw_input('What is your name?\\\\n')\\nprint 'Hi, %s.' % name\\n'''\\nt=int(input())\\nc=input().split()\\ni=input().split()\\nx=0\\nz=0\\nwhile x<t:\\n\\tif c[x]==i[x]:\\n\\t\\tx+=1\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\ttemp=c[x]\\n\\t\\tfor j in range(x+1,t):\\n\\t\\t\\tc[j-1]=c[j]\\n\\t\\tc[t-1]=temp\\n\\tz+=1\\nprint(z)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem Requirements: The problem requires simulating a process execution scenario where tasks are executed according to an ideal order, and we need to calculate the total time taken based on the calling order and the ideal order.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Key considerations include understanding that moving a process in the calling order incurs a cost of 1, and executing a process also incurs a cost of 1. Edge cases might involve an empty list or matching ideal and calling orders from the start.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Employ a loop that iterates through the processes, checking if the first process in the calling order matches the next expected process in the ideal order. If they match, execute the process. Otherwise, move the first process to the end of the calling order. Keep track of the total time taken for both moving and executing processes.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Use appropriate data structures like lists to represent the calling and ideal orders. Manage the calling order by popping the first element and appending it to the end when it doesn't match the ideal order.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean when the calling order doesn't match the ideal order for the first element in the calling order?\",\n    \"How should the total time be calculated in each step of the process?\",\n    \"What data structures are most suitable for representing the calling and ideal orders, and why?\",\n    \"How should you handle the case when the calling order matches the ideal order for the first element?\",\n    \"What are the potential edge cases or constraints to consider, and how might they affect the correctness and efficiency of the solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"It means that the first process in the calling order cannot be executed yet and must be moved to the end of the calling order, incurring a cost of 1 unit of time.\",\n    \"The total time should be incremented by 1 for each process that is moved to the end of the calling order and by 1 for each process that is executed.\",\n    \"Lists are suitable because they allow for easy manipulation of the order of processes, including popping the first element and appending it to the end.\",\n    \"If the first element of the calling order matches the next expected element in the ideal order, the process should be executed, and that element should be removed from the calling order. This also incurs a cost of 1 unit of time.\",\n    \"Edge cases could include an empty list of processes or scenarios where the calling order initially matches the ideal order. Constraints include the range of the number of processes (1 to 100), which affects the potential complexity of the solution.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
