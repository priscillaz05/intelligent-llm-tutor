There are three possible operations: double X, double Y, or decrement both X and Y by one.\\n- Identifying Constraints: X and Y are non-negative integers. If X < Y or Y < X after some operations, the program can continue to decrement both, and the max of the two needs to double until they become equal, then decrement to zero simultaneously.\\n- Edge Cases: Consider the cases when either X or Y are initially negative. If X = Y = 0, the answer is 0. If X > Y or Y > X and X == 0 and Y != 0, or vice versa, it is impossible to make both zeros (return -1). If initially X==Y, the answer is X (or Y).\\n- Algorithmic Approach: If X > Y, double Y until Y >= X.  The number of doublings can be calculated. The number of decrementing is X (or Y).\\n- Optimizations: The algorithm can be further optimized to reach the goal with minimized operations.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What conditions would make it impossible to reach (0, 0) for both X and Y?\",\n    \"What is the optimal way to balance X and Y before decrementing both simultaneously?\",\n    \"If X is significantly larger than Y, how does doubling Y affect the overall number of operations?\",\n    \"How can the number of doubling operations be calculated efficiently?\",\n    \"What is the best strategy to minimize operations to reach (0, 0) when X and Y are initially equal?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"If only one of X or Y is zero, while the other is not zero, and it is impossible to double the zero value to reach the other value, it will be impossible to make both values zero simultaneously.\",\n    \"The optimal way is to double the smaller value between X and Y until it is equal to or just slightly larger than the other value.
