Little Kuldeep fights for the right, just while Little Deepu fights for the wrong reasons, and supports the wrong ones in the kingdom.  Everyone's scared of these two warriors getting into a fight ever. But, in the final match of the tournament for the best warrior in the kingdom, these two warriors will eventually have to face each other. \\n\\nBut, here's the twist. Since, everyone knows that these two are the best ones, no one wants them to die. So, it's a no-kill contest between them. They CANNOT kill each other. They just have to hit each other, with their best moves.\\n\\nBoth, Little Deepu and Little Kuldeep will get n chances to hit the opponent. But, since Little Deepu fights for the wrong people, he had the power to convince people that he'll be the attacker, and Kuldeep be the defender - that is to say. So, what will happen is the following: Little Kuldeep  CANNOT attack Little Deepu before Little Deepu attacks him. Little Kuldeep can only retaliate to Little Deepu's hits, and NOT hit him before Deepu hits him.\\n\\nThat is to say, let's say both of them have 3 moves. So, a valid hitting combination would be:\\n1. DDDKKK\\n2. DKDDKK\\nAnd 3 other combinations.\\n\\nSo, ONLY after Deepu hits Kuldeep can Kuldeep hit him back!\\n\\nSo, you being a volunteer in managing the fights, have to figure out the number of valid combinations of the n hits by the both of them.\\n\\nInput format:\\nThe first line contains the number of test cases.\\nEvery test case contains an integer N.\\n\\nOutput format:\\nYou've to print out the number of valid combinations modulo by 1000000007.\\n\\nConstraints:\\n1 \u2264 Test Cases < 1001\\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 1000000  \\n\\nSAMPLE INPUT\\n2\\n2\\n1548\\n\\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\\n2\\n57584392\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"# Binomial coefficient with mod inverse of prime.

We are given N, which is the number of hits each warrior gets.\\n- Identifying Constraints: Kuldeep cannot attack before Deepu. This implies that in any valid sequence, the number of Deepu's hits must always be greater than or equal to the number of Kuldeep's hits at any given point in the sequence.\\n- Choosing an Appropriate Method: Recognize that the problem is essentially asking for the number of Dyck paths of length 2N. This can be solved using Catalan numbers, specifically the formula: Catalan(N) = (2N choose N) / (N + 1). Since we need to compute the result modulo 1000000007, we must use modular arithmetic and compute the modular inverse of (N + 1).\\n- Calculating Binomial Coefficient: The binomial coefficient (2N choose N) can be calculated as (2N)! / (N! * N!). To calculate this modulo MOD, we will precompute factorials modulo MOD up to 2N. Then, we will use Fermat's Little Theorem to compute the modular inverse of N! and (2N)!.\\n- Calculating Modular Inverse:  We use the formula a^(p-2) mod p where p is the modulus (1000000007).\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Can you describe the constraints of the valid hit combinations between Deepu and Kuldeep?\",\n    \"What mathematical concept can be used to solve this problem, considering the constraints?\",\n    \"How can you compute the binomial coefficient (2N choose N) efficiently modulo a large prime number?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the modular inverse of a number modulo a prime number, and why is it needed here?\",\n    \"What steps are needed to precompute factorials modulo MOD up to a maximum value?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Kuldeep can only hit Deepu after Deepu has already hit Kuldeep. Thus, the number of Deepu's hits must always be greater than or equal to the number of Kuldeep's hits at any point in the sequence.\",\n    \"The problem is equivalent to counting Dyck paths and can be solved using Catalan numbers.
