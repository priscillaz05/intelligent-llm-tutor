If the input is not a string, return an error message.\\n- Identifying Character Repetitions: Analyze the string to find sequences of repeating alphabetical characters. The task is to identify repeating characters that appear more than twice in a row.\\n- Applying Bracket Enclosure: After detecting a repetition of more than two identical characters, enclose the excess occurrences (those beyond the initial two) within brackets.\\n- Algorithm Selection: Use regular expressions to efficiently find and replace character sequences meeting the repetition criteria. This approach enables a concise and effective solution.\\n- Regular Expression Implementation: Construct a regular expression that captures character repetitions and uses backreferences to enclose the extra characters within brackets.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you ensure the input is a string, and what should the program do if it is not?\",\n    \"What is the best approach to identify consecutive repeating characters in a string?\",\n    \"Once you've identified a repeating sequence of more than two characters, how do you selectively enclose only the extra characters in brackets?\",\n    \"What is a concise and effective way to search for patterns in the string using regular expressions, and how can you replace them?\",\n    \"How can backreferences be used to insert the repeated characters into the bracketed portion of the output string?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"I can use the isinstance() function in Python to check if the input is a string. If it's not, the program should return the error message 'Please enter a valid string'.\",\n    \"Using regular expressions to find consecutive repeating characters is efficient. The regex can match any character followed by the same character one or more times.\",\n    \"The regex should capture the first two characters and the remaining repeating characters in separate groups.
