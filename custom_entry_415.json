Each operation is described by $3$ integers, ${a}$, ${b}$, and ${k}$. Here, ${a}$ and ${b}$ are indices of the jars, and ${k}$ is the number of candies to be added inside each jar whose index lies between ${a}$ and ${b}$ (both inclusive).\\nCan you tell the average number of candies after $m$ operations?\\n\\nExample    \\n\\n$n=5$ \\n\\n$operations=[[1,2,10],[3,5,10]]$   \\n\\nThe array has $5$ elements that all start at ${0}$.  In the first operation, add $10$ to the first $2$ elements.  Now the array is $[10,10,0,0,0]$.  In the second operation, add $10$ to the last $3$ elements (3 - 5).  Now the array is $[10,10,10,10,10]$ and the average is 10.

This indicates that creating an actual array to store the candies in each jar might lead to memory issues or time limit exceeded.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Given the large constraints on 'n', directly simulating the jar states isn't feasible. A more efficient approach is to calculate the total number of candies added across all operations and then divide by the number of jars to find the average. The integer division (floor) should be considered.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Reading the input efficiently and performing the calculation correctly is critical. Avoid floating-point errors in the calculation of the total candies or during the division. Use integer division to match the requirements.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the most efficient way to keep track of the total number of candies added to all jars without storing the state of each jar?\",\n    \"Considering the constraints on 'n', what data structures should be avoided to prevent memory issues?\",\n    \"How do you efficiently calculate the total number of candies added during each operation given the range [a, b] and the candy count 'k'?\",\n    \"What type of division should be used to meet the requirement of the 'floor' of the average?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently handle multiple operations without exceeding time constraints, considering the upper limit on 'm'?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Instead of maintaining an array of jar states, you can directly accumulate the total candies added during each operation into a single variable.\",\n    \"Avoid creating an array or list of size 'n' because 'n' can be very large (up to 10^7), leading to memory issues.\",\n    \"For each operation, calculate (b - a + 1) * k to find the total number of candies added during that operation, and add it to the running total.\",\n    \"Use integer division (// in Python, or a cast to int after division) to get the floor of the average.\",\n    \"Process each operation one by one, accumulating the total candies added.
