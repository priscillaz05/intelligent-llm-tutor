Inscribed in the weapon is an array of n (n \u2265 3) positive distinct integers (i.e. different, no duplicates are allowed).\\n\\nFind the largest subset (i.e. having the maximum number of elements) of this array such that its sum is a composite number. A positive integer x is called composite if there exists a positive integer y such that 1 < y < x and x is divisible by y.\\n\\nIf there are multiple subsets with this largest size with the composite sum, you can output any of them. It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem such a non-empty subset always exists.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100). Description of the test cases follows.\\n\\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the length of the array.\\n\\nThe second line of each test case contains n distinct integers a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 200) \u2014 the elements of the array.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nEach test case should have two lines of output.\\n\\nThe first line should contain a single integer x: the size of the largest subset with composite sum.

Prime numbers are positive integers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.  A crucial step is identifying if a number is composite or prime.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy:  The sum of all elements is calculated first. If this sum is composite, the entire set is the answer. If not (i.e., sum is prime), then iterate through the array, removing one element at a time. Check if the sum of the remaining elements is composite.  If a composite sum is found, the indices of elements in the subset are outputted.\\n- Optimization Considerations:  Precompute a list of primes up to a sufficiently large number (e.g., slightly greater than the largest possible sum) to facilitate primality tests. This is significantly more efficient than repeatedly checking for primality during subset generation.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are composite and prime numbers, and how do they relate to the problem's requirement?\",\n    \"If the sum of all elements in the array is composite, what is the solution?\",\n    \"If the sum of all elements is prime, what strategy can be used to find a subset with a composite sum?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently determine if a number is composite within the given constraints?\",\n    \"How should the indices of the elements in the subset be represented in the output?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Composite numbers are positive integers with divisors other than 1 and themselves, while prime numbers have only 1 and themselves as divisors.
