"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"Create a function taking a positive integer as its parameter and returning a string containing the Roman Numeral representation of that integer.\\n\\nModern Roman numerals are written by expressing each digit separately starting with the left most digit and skipping any digit with a value of zero. In Roman numerals 1990 is rendered: 1000=M, 900=CM, 90=XC; resulting in MCMXC. 2008 is written as 2000=MM, 8=VIII; or MMVIII. 1666 uses each Roman symbol in descending order: MDCLXVI.\\n\\nExample:\\n```python\\nsolution(1000) # should return 'M'\\n```\\n\\nHelp:\\n```\\nSymbol  Value\\nI             1\\nV             5\\nX             10\\nL             50\\nC             100\\nD             500\\nM             1,000\\n```\\n\\nRemember that there can't be more than 3 identical symbols in a row.\\n\\nMore about roman numerals - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def solution(n):\\n\\troman_numerals = {1000: 'M', 900: 'CM', 500: 'D', 400: 'CD', 100: 'C', 90: 'XC', 50: 'L', 40: 'XL', 10: 'X', 9: 'IX', 5: 'V', 4: 'IV', 1: 'I'}\\n\\troman_string = ''\\n\\tfor key in sorted(list(roman_numerals.keys()), reverse=True):\\n\\t\\twhile n >= key:\\n\\t\\t\\troman_string += roman_numerals[key]\\n\\t\\t\\tn -= key\\n\\treturn roman_string\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Conversion Rules: The problem requires converting integers to Roman numerals, respecting the subtractive notation (e.g., IV for 4, IX for 9). The conversion must also handle thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones digits separately.\\n- Structuring the Conversion Process: Identify a lookup structure or ruleset for converting each integer value (1, 4, 5, 9, 10, 40, 50, 90, 100, 400, 500, 900, 1000) to its corresponding Roman numeral symbol. Consider using a dictionary to map values to symbols.\\n- Iterating Through Possible Values: Iterate through the possible integer values in descending order. For each value, determine how many times it can be subtracted from the input number, and append the corresponding Roman numeral symbol to the result string.\\n- Managing Edge Cases and Constraints: Ensure that the algorithm correctly handles the edge cases where subtractive notation is used (e.g., 4, 9, 40, 90, 400, 900). Adhere to the rule that there can't be more than 3 identical symbols in a row.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does the subtractive notation impact the choice of Roman numeral values to consider?\",\n    \"In what order should you process the Roman numeral values, and why?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently determine when to use the subtractive notation rather than repeating a symbol?\",\n    \"What data structure would be most suitable for storing the mapping between integer values and Roman numeral symbols?\",\n    \"How do you handle the constraint that no more than three identical symbols can appear consecutively?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Subtractive notation requires us to include values like 4 (IV) and 9 (IX) in our conversion logic, in addition to the standard values like 1, 5, and 10. Without accounting for these, we could end up with incorrect Roman numeral representations.\",\n    \"Roman numeral values should be processed in descending order to ensure that the largest possible Roman numeral symbol is always used first. This guarantees the correct and efficient conversion.\",\n    \"I can efficiently determine when to use subtractive notation by checking if the number is close to the next higher power of 10 or a multiple of 5. For example, if the number is 4, 9, 40, 90, 400, or 900, then I use the subtractive representation.\",\n    \"A dictionary is the most suitable data structure for storing the mapping between integer values and Roman numeral symbols. It allows for quick and direct lookup of the Roman numeral symbol for a given integer value.\",\n    \"The mapping in the dictionary includes the values for which subtraction is needed, which makes it so a value will never be represented by more than three identical symbols in a row.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
