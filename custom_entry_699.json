For each blimp sent, you can make one of the following choices:\\nLet the blimp fly over every city, in which case the sadness of every city will decrease by Y, or,\\nChoose a city i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 N), and shower confetti over city i. In this case, the sadness of cities 1, 2, \\\\ldots, i-1 will decrease by Y, the sadness of city i will decrease by X, and cities i+1, \\\\ldots, N see no change in sadness.\\n\\nFind the minimum number of blimps needed such that, by making the above choice optimally for each blimp, you can ensure that no city is sad (i.e, in the end every city has sadness \u2264 0).\\n\\n------ Input Format ------ \\n\\n- The first line of input contains a single integer T \u2014 the number of test cases.

We can either let a blimp fly over all cities (reducing sadness by Y), or shower confetti on city i (reducing sadness of cities 1 to i-1 by Y and city i by X).\\n- Identifying Key Decisions: The key decision for each blimp is whether to use it to reduce sadness globally by Y or locally up to a certain city i, reducing city i's sadness by X.\\n- Optimization Strategy: When Y >= X, it's always optimal to send blimps over all cities, because we want to reduce the max sadness, so calculate the maximum sadness and reduce it by Y each time. If Y<X, then we will have to choose the optimal location for confetti, iterating from the rightmost city, ensuring that the rightmost city is sad <=0, and accumulate the blimp count.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the core problem we are trying to solve, and what are the two actions we can take with each blimp?\",\n    \"How should we decide, for each blimp, whether to let it fly over all cities or shower confetti on a specific city?\",\n    \"If Y >= X, what is the optimal strategy and how do we calculate the number of blimps needed?\",\n    \"If Y < X, how do we determine the number of blimps needed and the location for confetti?\",\n    \"How can we efficiently keep track of sadness levels as we simulate using blimps and confetti?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"We need to minimize the number of blimps used to reduce the sadness of all cities to 0 or less. Each blimp can either reduce the sadness of all cities by Y, or reduce the sadness of cities 1 to i-1 by Y and city i by X.\",\n    \"We should choose the action for each blimp based on which action reduces sadness more effectively.

We can calculate the number of blimps needed by dividing the maximum sadness by Y and rounding up to the nearest integer.\",\n    \"If Y < X, we iterate from the rightmost city.
