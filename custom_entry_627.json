This means avoiding iterative constructs like `for` or `while`.\\n- Identifying Base Case: A base case is needed to stop the recursion. When n is 0, the recursion should terminate.\\n- Recursive Call: In each recursive step, print \\\"GFG\\\" and then call the function again with a decremented value of n.\\n- Output Formatting: Print \\\"GFG\\\" followed by a space to match the expected output format.

In this case, the function should return without printing anything, stopping the recursion.\",\n    \"In each recursive call, print 'GFG' once and then call the function again with n-1.
