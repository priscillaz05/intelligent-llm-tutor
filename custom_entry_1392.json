The height of each shelf is determined by the tallest book on that shelf.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Consider cases where a single book's thickness exceeds the shelf width, making it impossible to place. Account for the fact that the order of books must be maintained. Recognize that a dynamic programming approach might be suitable due to the overlapping subproblems.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Dynamic programming appears to be a good approach. `dp[i]` could represent the minimum height needed to place the first `i` books. Then, iterate through possible combinations of books on the last shelf and calculate the total height as the height of the current shelf plus `dp[j]` where `j` is the index of the book before the beginning of the current shelf.\\n- Implementing the Dynamic Programming: Initialize a DP array. Iterate from `i = 1` to `n`. For each `i`, iterate backwards from `i` to `1` representing the books on current shelf. Calculate the width of the shelf and maximum height of the books on this shelf. If the shelf width exceeds the maximum width, break the inner loop. Update the `dp[i]` with minimum height found so far.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the core constraint of the problem that makes it challenging to solve?\",\n    \"If a book's thickness is greater than the shelf width, how should you handle that scenario?\",\n    \"Why might dynamic programming be an appropriate strategy for this problem, and how would you define the state in your DP approach?\",\n    \"When calculating the cost of placing books on a shelf, what needs to be considered beyond just the sum of book heights?\",\n    \"How do you ensure the book order is maintained while exploring different shelf configurations?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The main challenge lies in finding the optimal arrangement of books across shelves to minimize the total height, while adhering to both the shelf width constraint and the fixed book order.\",\n    \"If any single book's thickness exceeds the shelf width, it's impossible to create a valid arrangement, and the algorithm should handle this, possibly by returning an impossible value or raising an error if such a state is reached during computation (though the problem states 1 <= books[i][0] <= shelf_width <= 1000, so such a condition is guaranteed never to occur).\",\n    \"Dynamic programming is suitable due to the overlapping subproblems involved in exploring different shelf configurations. I'd define `dp[i]` as the minimum possible height to place the first `i` books.\",\n    \"Beyond the sum of book heights, you need to consider the maximum height of the books on the current shelf, as this determines the height of that particular shelf. The total height is the sum of such maximum heights for each shelf.\",\n    \"The order of books must be maintained when iterating through combinations of books to place on the same shelf.
