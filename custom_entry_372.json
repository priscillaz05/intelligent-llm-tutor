You can perform two types of operations on the first string:\\n\\nAppend a lowercase English letter to the end of the string.\\nDelete the last character of the string. Performing this operation on an empty string results in an empty string.\\n\\nGiven an integer, $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mbox{k}}$, and two strings, $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mathrm{~S~}}$ and $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\boldsymbol{t}}$, determine whether or not you can convert $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mathrm{~S~}}$ to $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\boldsymbol{t}}$ by performing exactly $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mbox{k}}$ of the above operations on $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mathrm{~S~}}$.

Otherwise, print No.\\n\\nExample. \\ns=$[a,b,c]$ \\n\\nt=$[d,e,f]$ \\n\\nk=6  \\n\\nTo convert $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mathrm{~S~}}$ to $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\boldsymbol{t}}$, we first delete all of the characters in $3$ moves.  Next we add each of the characters of $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\boldsymbol{t}}$ in order.  On the $6^{th}$ move, you will have the matching string.

This involves finding the length of the common prefix, calculating deletions needed from `s`, and appends needed to construct `t`.\\n- Dealing with Excess Operations: If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the lengths of `s` and `t`, we can always achieve the transformation (by deleting all of `s` and appending all of `t`), so the answer is \\\"Yes\\\".\\n- Handling Operation Parity: If `k` is large enough, there can be redundant delete operations on an empty string. If the difference between the minimal operations needed and `k` is even or zero it means the redundant operations are possible. We can perform the necessary number of operations to transform string s to string t, plus some number of delete and append operations that cancel each other (ex. delete from an empty string, then append to that string.) We only want to check the 'evenness' of the number since any even amount of unnecessary operations is possible (delete then append will get us back to where we started.)\\n- Considering Edge Cases: If `k` is less than the minimal required operations, it's impossible to transform `s` to `t`, so the answer is \\\"No\\\".\\n\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the minimum number of operations needed to transform string `s` into string `t`?\",\n    \"If `k` is greater than the minimum operations, is it always possible to transform `s` into `t`?\",\n    \"How do you handle situations where k is greater than or equal to the sum of lengths of s and t?\",\n    \"What condition must be met for k to be a valid number of operations, considering the minimum operations required?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases to consider, and how do they impact your solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The minimum number of operations is the sum of deletions needed from `s` (length of `s` minus length of the common prefix) and appends needed to construct `t` (length of `t` minus length of the common prefix).\",\n    \"No, it's not *always* possible. The difference between `k` and the minimum operations needs to be even, or k has to be large enough.\",\n    \"If k is greater than or equal to len(s) + len(t), then we can always convert s to t by first deleting all characters in s, then appending all characters in t. So the result is always 'Yes'.\",\n    \"The difference between `k` and the minimum number of operations (deletions + appends) must be non-negative and even. That is, (k - (deletions + appends)) >= 0 and (k - (deletions + appends)) % 2 == 0.\",\n    \"Edge cases include `s` and `t` being identical, or one or both strings being empty. If k is less than the operations needed to transform `s` to `t`, it is impossible to transform s to t. \"\n  ]\n}\n```"
