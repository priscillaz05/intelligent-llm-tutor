A segment is beautiful if the bitwise AND of its elements is less than or equal to a given value X.\\n- Decomposing the Problem: For each query, iterate through all possible segments [l, r] within the specified range [L_j, R_j]. Calculate the bitwise AND of the elements in each segment and check if it's less than or equal to X_j.\\n- Optimizing the Bitwise AND Calculation: Realize that the bitwise AND operation is monotonic. As you extend the segment to the right, the bitwise AND value can only decrease or stay the same. If the bitwise AND exceeds X at some point, the segment isn't beautiful, and you can move on.\\n- Handling Constraints: Acknowledge the constraints on N, Q, L_j, R_j, X_j, and A_i and how they might affect algorithm choice and complexity. For smaller constraints, a brute-force approach might suffice.\\n- Edge Cases and Special Conditions: Recognize edge cases like empty segments or segments with a single element.\\n- Algorithmic Considerations: For each query, generate all possible sub-segments within the range [L_j, R_j] and efficiently compute the bitwise AND. Maintain a count of beautiful segments found so far.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the meaning of a 'beautiful segment' in this problem, and how can you verify if a given segment is beautiful?\",\n    \"Given the range [L_j, R_j] for a query, how can you generate all possible segments [l, r] such that L_j <= l <= r <= R_j?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently calculate the bitwise AND of all elements within a segment [l, r] of the array A?\",\n    \"Since the bitwise AND is monotonic, how can you use this property to optimize the calculation for larger segments?\",\n    \"Considering the constraints on N and Q, what algorithmic approach is suitable to avoid exceeding time limits?\",\n    \"Are there any edge cases or special conditions (e.g., empty arrays, segments of length 1) that need specific handling?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A segment [l, r] is 'beautiful' if the bitwise AND of all elements A_i where l <= i <= r is less than or equal to X.
