A scalene triangle is defined as having all three sides of different lengths.\\n- Input Handling: The input consists of 'T' test cases. For each test case, there are three integers representing the sides of a triangle.\\n- Logic Implementation: The core logic involves comparing the three sides of the triangle. If all three sides are different from each other, the triangle is scalene.\\n- Output Generation: The output should be 'YES' if the triangle is scalene and 'NO' otherwise, for each test case.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the key characteristics of a scalene triangle, and how do they relate to the code's logic?\",\n    \"How does the code handle multiple test cases efficiently?\",\n    \"What would happen if two sides were equal, and how would the output be affected?\",\n    \"Is it important to check the triangle inequality theorem (A + B > C, etc.) in this specific problem, and why?\",\n    \"Could you suggest alternative approaches to determine if a triangle is scalene, and what are their potential benefits or drawbacks?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A scalene triangle has all three sides of different lengths. The code's logic directly checks if A != B != C, which means all sides are unique.\",\n    \"The code handles multiple test cases using a 'for' loop that iterates 'T' times, processing each set of inputs within the loop.\",\n    \"If two sides were equal, the condition 'n != m != p' would evaluate to False, and the output would be 'NO' because the triangle would not be scalene.\",\n    \"No, it's not important because the prompt states \\\"It is guaranteed that the sides represent a valid triangle.\\\"\",\n    \"An alternative approach could use sets. If len(set([A, B, C])) == 3, then the triangle is scalene. This is also efficient and concise.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
