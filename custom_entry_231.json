Trees are undirected acyclic graphs with k vertices and k - 1 edges, where k is some integer. Note that one vertex is a valid tree.\\n\\nThere is exactly one relative living in each vertex of each tree, they have unique ids from 1 to n. For each Ball i we know the id of its most distant relative living on the same tree. If there are several such vertices, we only know the value of the one with smallest id among those.\\n\\nHow many trees are there in the forest?\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line contains single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 104) \u2014 the number of Balls living in the forest.\\n\\nThe second line contains a sequence p1, p2, ..., pn of length n, where (1 \u2264 pi \u2264 n) holds and pi denotes the most distant from Ball i relative living on the same tree.

Each vertex represents a relative with a unique ID from 1 to n. For each relative i, we are given p[i], which is the ID of the most distant relative in the same tree. The goal is to determine the number of trees in the forest.\\n- Identifying key properties: A key observation is that if a[a[i]] == i, then i and a[i] are two endpoints of a longest path in their tree. We need to find all such pairs (i, a[i]) and count them as trees. If i == a[i], it still contributes to the count since a single node can form a tree. We can use a set to avoid counting the same tree twice if i < a[i] and a[i] < i appear.\\n- Constructing the solution: The solution initializes a set `was` to store the identified trees. It iterates through all relatives (from 1 to n). If a[a[i]] == i, it means relative i and a[i] are endpoints of a diameter in their tree (or it's an isolated node if i == a[i]). In this case, we add the smaller ID of the two relatives to the `was` set to avoid double-counting. Finally, the size of the `was` set will be the total number of trees in the forest.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does p[i] represent in the problem description and how is it related to the tree structure?\",\n    \"What condition must be satisfied between i and p[i] if they belong to the same tree, and it's a longest path? How can we use this condition to identify distinct trees?\",\n    \"How can we avoid double-counting trees when both i and p[i] point to each other (i.e., p[i] = j and p[j] = i)?\",\n    \"What data structure is appropriate to store the unique trees and ensure that we do not count the same tree more than once?\",\n    \"What edge cases need to be considered, such as when a relative is the most distant relative to itself (p[i] == i)?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"p[i] represents the ID of the most distant relative from relative i within the same tree. It helps determine the tree structure and the relationships between relatives.\",\n    \"The condition that must be satisfied is that p[p[i]] == i. This indicates that i and p[i] are endpoints of the longest path in their tree, allowing us to identify distinct trees.\",\n    \"To avoid double-counting, we can take the minimum of i and p[i] when both point to each other and add that minimum value to a set. Since sets only contain unique elements, we avoid counting the same tree twice.\",\n    \"A set is an appropriate data structure because it stores unique elements. Adding the minimum of i and p[i] to a set ensures that we only count each tree once.\",\n    \"An edge case to consider is when a relative is the most distant relative to itself (p[i] == i). In this case, that relative forms a tree by itself, and the algorithm should correctly count it as one tree.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
