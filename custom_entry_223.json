The final test of the applicants' courage and strength will be a fencing tournament. The tournament is held by the following rules: the participants fight one on one, the winner (or rather, the survivor) transfers to the next round.\\n\\nBefore the battle both participants stand at the specified points on the Ox axis with integer coordinates. Then they make moves in turn. The first participant moves first, naturally. During a move, the first participant can transfer from the point x to any integer point of the interval [x + a; x + b]. The second participant can transfer during a move to any integer point of the interval [x - b; x - a]. That is, the options for the players' moves are symmetric (note that the numbers a and b are not required to be positive, and if a \u2264 0 \u2264 b, then staying in one place is a correct move). At any time the participants can be located arbitrarily relative to each other, that is, it is allowed to \\\"jump\\\" over the enemy in any direction. A participant wins if he uses his move to transfer to the point where his opponent is.\\n\\nOf course, the princess has already chosen a husband and now she wants to make her sweetheart win the tournament. He has already reached the tournament finals and he is facing the last battle. The princess asks the tournament manager to arrange the tournament finalists in such a way that her sweetheart wins the tournament, considering that both players play optimally. However, the initial location of the participants has already been announced, and we can only pull some strings and determine which participant will be first and which one will be second. But how do we know which participant can secure the victory? Alas, the princess is not learned in the military affairs... Therefore, she asks you to determine how the battle will end considering that both opponents play optimally. Also, if the first player wins, your task is to determine his winning move.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line contains four space-separated integers \u2014 x1, x2, a and b (x1 \u2260 x2, a \u2264 b,  - 109 \u2264 x1, x2, a, b \u2264 109) \u2014 coordinates of the points where the first and the second participant start, and the numbers that determine the players' moves, correspondingly.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nOn the first line print the outcome of the battle as \\\"FIRST\\\" (without the quotes), if both players play optimally and the first player wins. Print \\\"SECOND\\\" (without the quotes) if the second player wins and print \\\"DRAW\\\" (without the quotes), if nobody is able to secure the victory.\\n\\nIf the first player wins, print on the next line the single integer x \u2014 the coordinate of the point where the first player should transfer to win. The indicated move should be valid, that is, it should meet the following condition: x1 + a \u2264 x \u2264 x1 + b. If there are several winning moves, print any of them. If the first participant can't secure the victory, then you do not have to print anything.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nInput\\n\\n0 2 0 4\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nFIRST\\n2\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n0 2 1 1\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nSECOND\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n0 2 0 1\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nDRAW\\n\\nNote\\n\\nIn the first sample the first player can win in one move.\\n\\nIn the second sample the first participant must go to point 1, where the second participant immediately goes and wins. \\n\\nIn the third sample changing the position isn't profitable to either participant, so nobody wins.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"(x1, x2, a, b) = map(int, input().split())\\nif a <= 0 <= b:\\n\\tif x1 < x2:\\n\\t\\tif x2 - x1 <= b:\\n\\t\\t\\tprint('FIRST')\\n\\t\\t\\tprint(x2)\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tprint('DRAW')\\n\\telif x1 - x2 <= -a:\\n\\t\\tprint('FIRST')\\n\\t\\tprint(x2)\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tprint('DRAW')\\nelse:\\n\\treverse = False\\n\\tif a < 0:\\n\\t\\t(x1, x2, a, b) = (-x1, -x2, -b, -a)\\n\\t\\treverse = True\\n\\tif x1 > x2:\\n\\t\\tprint('DRAW')\\n\\telif (x2 - x1) % (a + b) == 0:\\n\\t\\tprint('SECOND')\\n\\telif a <= (x2 - x1) % (a + b) <= b:\\n\\t\\tprint('FIRST')\\n\\t\\tprint(x1 + (x2 - x1) % (a + b) if not reverse else -(x1 + (x2 - x1) % (a + b)))\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tprint('DRAW')\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem is a game between two players on a number line. Player 1 starts at x1 and can move to [x1+a, x1+b]. Player 2 starts at x2 and can move to [x2-b, x2-a]. The first player to land on the opponent's position wins.\\n- Identify Key Conditions: The condition a <= 0 <= b represents the case where a player can stay in place.  In this case, Player 1 wins if x2 is reachable in one move from x1. Otherwise, it's a draw.\\n- Handling Negative a and b: If a < 0, flip the coordinate system. Then, analyze according to the relationships between a, b, x1, and x2.\\n- Determining the Winner: If a <= 0 <= b, the first player wins if x2 is within [x1+a, x1+b], otherwise it's a draw. If a and b are both positive, and x1 > x2, the game is a draw. If a and b are both positive and x1 < x2, the first player wins if the distance between x1 and x2 mod (a+b) is between a and b. Otherwise, it's a second player win if the distance mod (a+b) is 0, otherwise it's a draw.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How should the code handle the case where a <= 0 <= b?\",\n    \"How should the code handle the case where a < 0?\",\n    \"If a and b are both positive and x1 < x2, what conditions determine the winner?\",\n    \"What does it mean for a player to 'win' in this context?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"If a <= 0 <= b, then if x2 is in the range [x1+a, x1+b], the first player wins by moving to x2. If not, the game is a draw because neither player can force a win.\",\n    \"If a < 0, the coordinate system should be flipped such that x1 becomes -x1, x2 becomes -x2, a becomes -b, and b becomes -a. This ensures that a is always non-negative.\",\n    \"The winner is determined by (x2-x1) % (a+b). If the result is between a and b, the first player wins. If the result is 0, the second player wins.
