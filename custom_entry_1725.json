Currently, there are n criminals along the road. No police station has been built on this road yet, so the mayor wants to build one.\\n\\nAs you are going to be in charge of this new police station, the mayor has asked you to choose a suitable position (some integer point) for building it. You should choose the best position for the police station, so that you could minimize the total time of your criminal catching mission. Your mission of catching the criminals will operate only from this station. \\n\\nThe new station will have only one patrol car. You will go to the criminals by this car, carry them on the car, bring them back to the police station and put them in prison. The patrol car can carry at most m criminals at a time. Note that, the criminals don't know about your mission. So, they will stay where they are instead of running away.\\n\\nYour task is to find the position for the police station, so that total distance you need to cover to catch all the criminals will be minimum possible. Note that, you also can built the police station on the positions where one or more criminals already exist. In such a case all these criminals are arrested instantly.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line of the input will have two integers n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 106) and m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 106) separated by spaces. The next line will contain n integers separated by spaces. The ith integer is the position of the ith criminal on the x-axis. Absolute value of positions will not exceed 109. If a criminal has position x, he/she is located in the point (x, 0) of the plane. \\n\\nThe positions of the criminals will be given in non-decreasing order. Note, that there can be more than one criminal standing at some point of the plane.\\n\\nNote: since the size of the input/output could be very large, don't use slow input/output techniques in your language. For example, do not use input/output streams (cin, cout) in C++.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nPrint a single integer, that means the minimum possible distance you need to cover to catch all the criminals.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nInput\\n\\n3 6\\n1 2 3\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n5 5\\n-7 -6 -3 -1 1\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n16\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n1 369\\n0\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n11 2\\n-375 -108 1336 1453 1598 1892 2804 3732 4291 4588 4822\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n18716\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import os\\nimport sys\\nfrom io import BytesIO, IOBase\\nBUFSIZE = 8192\\n\\nclass FastIO(IOBase):\\n\\tnewlines = 0\\n\\n\\tdef __init__(self, file):\\n\\t\\tself._fd = file.fileno()\\n\\t\\tself.buffer = BytesIO()\\n\\t\\tself.writable = 'x' in file.mode or 'r' not in file.mode\\n\\t\\tself.write = self.buffer.write if self.writable else None\\n\\n\\tdef read(self):\\n\\t\\twhile True:\\n\\t\\t\\tb = os.read(self._fd, max(os.fstat(self._fd).st_size, BUFSIZE))\\n\\t\\t\\tif not b:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\t\\t\\tptr = self.buffer.tell()\\n\\t\\t\\t(self.buffer.seek(0, 2), self.buffer.write(b), self.buffer.seek(ptr))\\n\\t\\tself.newlines = 0\\n\\t\\treturn self.buffer.read()\\n\\n\\tdef readline(self):\\n\\t\\twhile self.newlines == 0:\\n\\t\\t\\tb = os.read(self._fd, max(os.fstat(self._fd).st_size, BUFSIZE))\\n\\t\\t\\tself.newlines = b.count(b'\\\\n') + (not b)\\n\\t\\t\\tptr = self.buffer.tell()\\n\\t\\t\\t(self.buffer.seek(0, 2), self.buffer.write(b), self.buffer.seek(ptr))\\n\\t\\tself.newlines -= 1\\n\\t\\treturn self.buffer.readline()\\n\\n\\tdef flush(self):\\n\\t\\tif self.writable:\\n\\t\\t\\tos.write(self._fd, self.buffer.getvalue())\\n\\t\\t\\t(self.buffer.truncate(0), self.buffer.seek(0))\\n\\nclass IOWrapper(IOBase):\\n\\n\\tdef __init__(self, file):\\n\\t\\tself.buffer = FastIO(file)\\n\\t\\tself.flush = self.buffer.flush\\n\\t\\tself.writable = self.buffer.writable\\n\\t\\tself.write = lambda s: self.buffer.write(s.encode('ascii'))\\n\\t\\tself.read = lambda : self.buffer.read().decode('ascii')\\n\\t\\tself.readline = lambda : self.buffer.readline().decode('ascii')\\n(sys.stdin, sys.stdout) = (IOWrapper(sys.stdin), IOWrapper(sys.stdout))\\ninput = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\\\\r\\\\n')\\nfrom math import gcd, ceil\\n\\ndef prod(a, mod=10 ** 9 + 7):\\n\\tans = 1\\n\\tfor each in a:\\n\\t\\tans = ans * each % mod\\n\\treturn ans\\n\\ndef lcm(a, b):\\n\\treturn a * b // gcd(a, b)\\n\\ndef binary(x, length=16):\\n\\ty = bin(x)[2:]\\n\\treturn y if len(y) >= length else '0' * (length - len(y)) + y\\nfor _ in range(int(input()) if not True else 1):\\n\\t(n, m) = map(int, input().split())\\n\\ta = list(map(int, input().split()))\\n\\tm = min(m, n - 1)\\n\\ti = n // 2\\n\\tj = min(i + 1, n - 1)\\n\\tans = 0\\n\\tcur = 0\\n\\twhile cur != i:\\n\\t\\tans += (a[i] - a[cur]) * 2\\n\\t\\tcur = min(cur + m, i)\\n\\tcur = n - 1\\n\\twhile cur != i:\\n\\t\\tans += (a[cur] - a[i]) * 2\\n\\t\\tcur = max(i, cur - m)\\n\\tanswers = [ans]\\n\\ti = j\\n\\tans = 0\\n\\tcur = 0\\n\\twhile cur != i:\\n\\t\\tans += (a[i] - a[cur]) * 2\\n\\t\\tcur = min(cur + m, i)\\n\\tcur = n - 1\\n\\twhile cur != i:\\n\\t\\tans += (a[cur] - a[i]) * 2\\n\\t\\tcur = max(i, cur - m)\\n\\tanswers += [ans]\\n\\tprint(min(answers))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires finding the optimal location for a police station on the x-axis to minimize the total distance traveled to catch criminals and return them to the station, given a patrol car with a limited capacity.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints: The patrol car can carry at most 'm' criminals. Criminals are located on the x-axis. The police station can be built at any integer point, including locations with existing criminals.\\n- Determining Optimal Strategy: The optimal location will be either the median or a point close to the median of the criminal positions. Calculate the total distance for a few potential locations around the median and choose the minimum. The total distance is calculated by considering the car's capacity 'm'.\\n- Accounting for Input Format and Constraints: Read input using fast I/O methods to avoid exceeding time limits. The number of criminals 'n' and the car capacity 'm' are provided. The criminal positions are given in non-decreasing order.\\n- Implementing the Solution:  Iterate through the sorted positions, collecting criminals in batches of 'm', and calculating the distance for each potential police station location. Track the minimum total distance and output the result.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the significance of the criminal positions being given in non-decreasing order, and how does it simplify the problem?\",\n    \"How does the car capacity 'm' affect the calculation of the total distance traveled?\",\n    \"What are the key considerations when choosing a potential location for the police station to minimize the total distance?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases or special scenarios that need to be considered, and how should they be handled?\",\n    \"How can the total distance be calculated efficiently for each potential police station location, considering the car's capacity?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The fact that the criminal positions are in non-decreasing order simplifies the process of iterating through the criminals. It makes it easier to determine the median position. It helps streamline calculating the distance without sorting\",\n    \"The car capacity 'm' determines how many criminals can be transported back to the station in one trip. The distance covered for each batch of criminals needs to be multiplied by 2 (to account for going to the criminals and returning to the station).\",\n    \"The police station location should be near the center (median) of all criminal locations. Locations at or near existing criminal positions are good candidates as they may minimize the total sum of distances.\",\n    \"An edge case to consider is where there is only one criminal, in that case total distance will be zero, if police station is built on the criminals position and it is optimal. Another special case is m>n. If n is small the number of required trips is less. Also, the car capacity being large can simplify the distance calculation, meaning all criminals can be picked up at once.\",\n    \"The total distance is computed by considering the batches of size 'm' criminals. Distance for each batch will be twice the distance from the police station to the location of the farthest criminal in that batch.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
