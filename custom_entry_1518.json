Before she can strike, she needs to know where the lair is. And the intel she has is not very good.\\n\\nHeidi knows that the lair can be represented as a rectangle on a lattice, with sides parallel to the axes. Each vertex of the polygon occupies an integer point on the lattice. For each cell of the lattice, Heidi can check the level of Zombie Contamination. This level is an integer between 0 and 4, equal to the number of corners of the cell that are inside or on the border of the rectangle.\\n\\nAs a test, Heidi wants to check that her Zombie Contamination level checker works. Given the output of the checker, Heidi wants to know whether it could have been produced by a single non-zero area rectangular-shaped lair (with axis-parallel sides). [Image]\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer N, the size of the lattice grid (5 \u2264 N \u2264 50). The next N lines each contain N characters, describing the level of Zombie Contamination of each cell in the lattice. Every character of every line is a digit between 0 and 4.\\n\\nCells are given in the same order as they are shown in the picture above: rows go in the decreasing value of y coordinate, and in one row cells go in the order of increasing x coordinate. This means that the first row corresponds to cells with coordinates (1, N), ..., (N, N) and the last row corresponds to cells with coordinates (1, 1), ..., (N, 1).\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nThe first line of the output should contain Yes if there exists a single non-zero area rectangular lair with corners on the grid for which checking the levels of Zombie Contamination gives the results given in the input, and No otherwise.\\n\\n\\n-----Example-----\\nInput\\n6\\n000000\\n000000\\n012100\\n024200\\n012100\\n000000\\n\\nOutput\\nYes\\n\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nThe lair, if it exists, has to be rectangular (that is, have corners at some grid points with coordinates (x_1, y_1), (x_1, y_2), (x_2, y_1), (x_2, y_2)), has a non-zero area and be contained inside of the grid (that is, 0 \u2264 x_1 < x_2 \u2264 N, 0 \u2264 y_1 < y_2 \u2264 N), and result in the levels of Zombie Contamination as reported in the input.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"n = int(input())\\nA = [input() for i in range(n)]\\n\\ndef early_exit():\\n\\tprint('No')\\n\\texit()\\nif n < 3:\\n\\tearly_exit()\\ncorner_row = []\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\tif '1' in A[i]:\\n\\t\\tcorner_row.append(i)\\nif len(corner_row) != 2:\\n\\tearly_exit()\\n\\ndef check_zero(x):\\n\\tfor i in x:\\n\\t\\tif i != '0':\\n\\t\\t\\treturn False\\n\\treturn True\\nfor i in range(corner_row[0]):\\n\\tif not check_zero(A[i]):\\n\\t\\tearly_exit()\\nfor i in range(corner_row[1] + 1, n):\\n\\tif not check_zero(A[i]):\\n\\t\\tearly_exit()\\nfor j in range(n):\\n\\tif A[corner_row[0]][j] != '0':\\n\\t\\tleft_corner = j\\n\\t\\tbreak\\nfor j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\\n\\tif A[corner_row[0]][j] != '0':\\n\\t\\tright_corner = j\\n\\t\\tbreak\\nif A[corner_row[0]][left_corner] != '1' or A[corner_row[0]][right_corner] != '1' or left_corner == right_corner:\\n\\tearly_exit()\\nfor j in range(n):\\n\\tif A[corner_row[1]][j] != '0':\\n\\t\\tleft2_corner = j\\n\\t\\tbreak\\nfor j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\\n\\tif A[corner_row[1]][j] != '0':\\n\\t\\tright2_corner = j\\n\\t\\tbreak\\nif A[corner_row[1]][left2_corner] != '1' or A[corner_row[1]][right2_corner] != '1' or left_corner != left2_corner or (right_corner != right2_corner):\\n\\tearly_exit()\\nfor i in corner_row:\\n\\tfor j in range(left_corner + 1, right_corner):\\n\\t\\tif A[i][j] != '2':\\n\\t\\t\\tearly_exit()\\nfor i in range(corner_row[0] + 1, corner_row[1]):\\n\\tif not check_zero(A[i][:left_corner]):\\n\\t\\tearly_exit()\\n\\tif not check_zero(A[i][right_corner + 1:]):\\n\\t\\tearly_exit()\\n\\tif A[i][left_corner] != '2' or A[i][right_corner] != '2':\\n\\t\\tearly_exit()\\n\\tfor j in range(left_corner + 1, right_corner):\\n\\t\\tif A[i][j] != '4':\\n\\t\\t\\tearly_exit()\\nprint('Yes')\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: Comprehend that the task involves analyzing a grid of zombie contamination levels to determine if it could have been produced by a single, axis-aligned, rectangular lair. The contamination level of each cell represents the number of corners of the cell within the lair.\\n- Identifying Key Properties of Rectangular Lair: Recognize that the lair is a rectangle, and therefore, has two rows containing '1's as corner indicators, and the corner indicators must be consistent across those rows.\\n- Determining Edge Cases and Constraints: The rectangle must have a non-zero area and must be fully contained within the grid. Consider the case when N is small, where a rectangle cannot exist.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy:  The strategy involves checking for the rows which contain corners ('1'). If the number of corner rows is not two, then a rectangle can't be formed. Then check if all other rows before and after the identified corner rows consist of '0's. Find the leftmost and rightmost corners for each identified corner row. Check if these are '1'. The leftmost and rightmost positions have to be the same for both rows containing the corners. Check the inner rows. The inner cells should be '4', the edges '2' and the remaining '0'.\\n- Optimizations: Early exit if conditions do not match the potential configuration of a rectangular lair. This reduces computation.\\n\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does the zombie contamination level represent, and how does it relate to the corners of a rectangular lair?\",\n    \"How would you identify potential rows that might contain the corners of the rectangular lair?\",\n    \"What properties must the rows and columns outside the rectangular lair have?\",\n    \"Given the contamination level of a cell, how can you determine if it could be part of a valid rectangular lair?\",\n    \"What are the key characteristics of a valid rectangular lair configuration within the grid?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The zombie contamination level of a cell represents the number of corners of that cell that lie inside or on the border of the rectangular lair. It ranges from 0 to 4.\",\n    \"I would identify rows that might contain corners of the lair by looking for rows that contain '1' in the input grid, as '1' signifies a corner.\",\n    \"Rows outside the identified rectangle rows should only consist of '0's. Columns to the left and right of the identified left and right corners should consist of '0's too.\",\n    \"If the cell shows '0', it must be outside the rectangle; If the cell shows '1' it is on the corners; if it shows '2' it is on the edges; if it shows '4', it must be within the rectangle.\",\n    \"A valid rectangular lair configuration must consist of exactly two rows that contain the corners '1', with identical positions of the leftmost and rightmost corners in those two rows.
