They often are in different rooms of the office in different cities and even countries. To keep in touch and track the results of the project, the F company conducts shared online meetings in a Spyke chat.\\n\\nOne day the director of the F company got hold of the records of a part of an online meeting of one successful team. The director watched the record and wanted to talk to the team leader. But how can he tell who the leader is? The director logically supposed that the leader is the person who is present at any conversation during a chat meeting. In other words, if at some moment of time at least one person is present on the meeting, then the leader is present on the meeting.\\n\\nYou are the assistant director. Given the 'user logged on'/'user logged off' messages of the meeting in the chronological order, help the director determine who can be the leader. Note that the director has the record of only a continuous part of the meeting (probably, it's not the whole meeting).\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line contains integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 105) \u2014 the number of team participants and the number of messages. Each of the next m lines contains a message in the format:\\n\\n  * '+ id': the record means that the person with number id (1 \u2264 id \u2264 n) has logged on to the meeting. \\n  * '- id': the record means that the person with number id (1 \u2264 id \u2264 n) has logged off from the meeting. \\n\\n\\n\\nAssume that all the people of the team are numbered from 1 to n and the messages are given in the chronological order. It is guaranteed that the given sequence is the correct record of a continuous part of the meeting. It is guaranteed that no two log on/log off events occurred simultaneously.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nIn the first line print integer k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n) \u2014 how many people can be leaders. In the next line, print k integers in the increasing order \u2014 the numbers of the people who can be leaders.\\n\\nIf the data is such that no member of the team can be a leader, print a single number 0.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nInput\\n\\n5 4\\n+ 1\\n+ 2\\n- 2\\n- 1\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n4\\n1 3 4 5 \\n\\nInput\\n\\n3 2\\n+ 1\\n- 2\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n1\\n3 \\n\\nInput\\n\\n2 4\\n+ 1\\n- 1\\n+ 2\\n- 2\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n5 6\\n+ 1\\n- 1\\n- 3\\n+ 3\\n+ 4\\n- 4\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n3\\n2 3 5 \\n\\nInput\\n\\n2 4\\n+ 1\\n- 2\\n+ 2\\n- 1\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n0\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().strip().split(' ')]\\nposibles_jefes = set(range(1, n + 1))\\nanteriores = set()\\nposteriores = set()\\ncontinuos = [True] * (n + 1)\\nmencionados = set()\\nposibles_jefes_mencionados = set()\\nultimo_en_salir = [True] * (n + 1)\\nultima_salida_inesperada = None\\nops = []\\nif m > 1:\\n\\tfor _ in range(0, m):\\n\\t\\t(s, n_s) = [x for x in input().strip().split(' ')]\\n\\t\\tn = int(n_s)\\n\\t\\tops.append((s, n))\\n\\tfor i in range(0, m):\\n\\t\\t(op, num) = ops[i]\\n\\t\\tcont = False\\n\\t\\tif op == '+':\\n\\t\\t\\tcont = not i or (ops[i - 1][0] == '-' and ops[i - 1][1] == num)\\n\\t\\t\\tposteriores.add(num)\\n\\t\\tif op == '-':\\n\\t\\t\\tcont = i == m - 1 or (ops[i + 1][0] == '+' and ops[i + 1][1] == num)\\n\\t\\t\\tif num not in mencionados:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanteriores.add(num)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tultima_salida_inesperada = num\\n\\t\\t\\tposteriores.discard(num)\\n\\t\\t\\tultimo_en_salir[num] &= not posteriores\\n\\t\\tcontinuos[num] &= cont\\n\\t\\tmencionados.add(num)\\n\\tif not anteriores and (not posteriores):\\n\\t\\tassert ultima_salida_inesperada is None\\n\\t\\tif ops[0][0] == '+' and ops[-1][0] == '-' and (ops[0][1] == ops[-1][1]) and continuos[ops[0][1]] and ultimo_en_salir[ops[0][1]]:\\n\\t\\t\\tposibles_jefes_mencionados.add(ops[0][1])\\n\\telif not posteriores:\\n\\t\\tassert ultima_salida_inesperada is not None\\n\\t\\tposibles_jefes_filtrados = list(filter(lambda x: continuos[x] and ultimo_en_salir[x] and (ultima_salida_inesperada == x), anteriores))\\n\\t\\tassert len(posibles_jefes_filtrados) <= 1\\n\\t\\tif posibles_jefes_filtrados:\\n\\t\\t\\tassert posibles_jefes_filtrados[0] == ops[-1][1]\\n\\t\\t\\tposibles_jefes_mencionados.add(ops[-1][1])\\n\\telif not anteriores:\\n\\t\\tassert ultima_salida_inesperada is None\\n\\t\\tposibles_jefes_filtrados = list(filter(lambda x: continuos[x] and ultimo_en_salir[x], posteriores))\\n\\t\\tassert len(posibles_jefes_filtrados) <= 1\\n\\t\\tif posibles_jefes_filtrados:\\n\\t\\t\\tassert posibles_jefes_filtrados[0] == ops[0][1]\\n\\t\\t\\tposibles_jefes_mencionados.add(ops[0][1])\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tassert ultima_salida_inesperada is not None\\n\\t\\tposibles_jefes_mencionados = set(filter(lambda x: ultimo_en_salir[x] and continuos[x] and (ultima_salida_inesperada == x), anteriores & posteriores))\\n\\tposibles_jefes -= mencionados - posibles_jefes_mencionados\\nprint(len(posibles_jefes))\\nif len(posibles_jefes):\\n\\tprint(' '.join(map(str, sorted(posibles_jefes))))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the problem: The problem asks us to find potential leaders in a meeting based on log data. A leader is defined as someone who is present whenever at least one person is in the meeting.\\n- Data structures: We can use sets to keep track of users who have logged on and off. This helps us determine who is present at any given time.\\n- Algorithm outline: Iterate through the log data. Maintain a set of currently online users. If at any point this set is not empty, all users are potential leaders except those who never logged in during the entire meeting recording duration. We need to keep track of who logged in and out, and remove members who are never online when others are online.\\n- Edge cases: Consider cases where the log is empty, or where nobody is present at certain times. In the general case, the potential leaders will include people who never joined the meeting.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you define a leader in this context?\",\n    \"What data structures can you use to keep track of the users logged in and out?\",\n    \"What edge cases might occur that would affect the solution?\",\n    \"How can you ensure that the potential leaders are listed in increasing order?\",\n    \"How do you handle the condition where no one can be a leader?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A leader is a person who is present at any conversation during a chat meeting.
