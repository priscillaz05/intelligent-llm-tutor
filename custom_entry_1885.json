A move from (a, b) to (c, d) is valid only if a != c and b != d. The goal is to find the minimum number of moves from a start to end coordinate.\\n- Identifying Potential Edge Cases: The coordinates are within the range [1, 10]. The start and end coordinates are distinct. If either the row or column are equal, one move is not enough.\\n- Selecting Algorithmic Strategy: If the start and end coordinates satisfy the move conditions (a != c and b != d), then the answer is 1. Otherwise, it will take two moves. Consider the case when either row or column are the same. The solution always returns 1 or 2 as it is always possible to reach the destination in at most two moves.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Directly compare start and end row and column values.
