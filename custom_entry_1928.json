For each valid $i$, let's denote the $i$-th character of $S$ by $S_i$.\\nYou have to convert the string $S$ into $P$ using zero or more operations. In one operation, you should choose two indices $i$ and $j$ ($1 \\leq i < j \\leq N$) such that $S_i$ is '1' and $S_j$ is '0', and swap $S_i$ with $S_j$.\\nDetermine if it is possible to convert $S$ into $P$ by performing some operations.\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.

A swap involves a '1' in S at index i and a '0' in S at index j (i < j).\\n- Identifying Key Constraints: Swaps are only allowed between '1' and '0' where the index of '1' is less than the index of '0'.\\n- Devising a Strategy: The core idea is to count the differences between S and P. We iterate through both strings. If S[i] is '0' and P[i] is '1', it means we need a '1' from the left to be swapped to this position. If S[i] is '1' and P[i] is '0', it means we need to find a '0' to the right to swap with this position. We can keep track of these needed '1's and '0's. If at any point we need a '1' but we haven't seen enough available '1's to swap from, it's impossible.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: If the number of '1's in S doesn't match the number of '1's in P, it's impossible to transform S into P. Also, if at any point when iterating through S and P, if we need a '1' to swap with and we don't have any available to swap, then it's impossible to convert S into P.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What conditions need to be met in order to make the conversion possible?\",\n    \"What happens if the number of 1's and 0's do not align between the two strings?\",\n    \"How can we track the feasibility of swaps during the string conversion process?\",\n    \"When can we definitively determine that the conversion is impossible?\",\n    \"How should the algorithm handle scenarios where the number of 1s in S is insufficient to satisfy all required swaps to match P?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The conversion is possible if, for every position where S and P differ, there exists a valid sequence of swaps that can transform S into P. The key is that a '1' can only be swapped with a '0' to its right.\",\n    \"If the number of 1's in S is not equal to the number of 1's in P (or equivalently, the number of 0's in S is not equal to the number of 0's in P), then it's impossible to convert S into P.\",\n    \"We can iterate through S and P simultaneously. If S[i] = '0' and P[i] = '1', we need to find a '1' to the left in S to swap. If S[i] = '1' and P[i] = '0', we need to find a '0' to the right in S to swap with. A counter can keep track of available '1's to move.\",\n    \"We can definitively determine that the conversion is impossible if at any point we need a '1' to convert a '0' in S to a '1' in P, but there aren't enough available '1's to the left to perform the necessary swaps.\",\n    \"If the number of 1s in S is insufficient to satisfy all required swaps, then the conversion is impossible and the algorithm should return 'No'.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
