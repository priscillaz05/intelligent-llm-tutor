Your task is to complete the function countWays() which accepts array arr[], its size m and integer N and returns the total number of ways we can form \u2018N\u2019 by adding array elements.\\nExpected Time Complexity: O(N*m)\\nExpected Auxiliary Space: O(N)\\nConstraints:\\n1 <= N , m <= 10^{3}\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"class Solution:\\n\\n\\tdef countWays(self, nums, m, target):\\n\\t\\tn = len(nums)\\n\\t\\tnums.sort()\\n\\t\\tdp = [0 for _ in range(target + 1)]\\n\\t\\tdp[0] = 1\\n\\t\\tfor total in range(1, target + 1):\\n\\t\\t\\tfor i in range(n):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif total - nums[i] >= 0:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdp[total] += dp[total - nums[i]]\\n\\t\\treturn dp[target] % (10 ** 9 + 7)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem Requirements: Recognize that the task is to find the number of ways to form a target sum 'N' using elements from the given array 'nums', with repetition and different arrangements allowed. Note the modulo operation required due to potentially large output.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Note the constraint that 1 <= N, m <= 10^3. Consider the base case where the target is 0, which has one way (no elements).\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Consider dynamic programming, where dp[i] stores the number of ways to form the sum i using the elements in 'nums'. The DP equation will involve iterating through the 'nums' array and summing up the ways to form the sum 'i - nums[j]' for each element 'nums[j]' if 'i - nums[j]' is non-negative.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Ensure the correct modulo operation.

It should be applied after each addition operation within the DP calculation, specifically `% (10 ** 9 + 7)`.\",\n    \"Dynamic programming breaks the problem down into smaller subproblems (forming sums less than 'N') and stores the results in a DP table (dp array). This avoids redundant calculations and improves efficiency. dp[0] = 1 initializes the base case, indicating that there's one way to form a sum of 0 (by using no elements).\",\n    \"The time complexity is O(N*m), where N is the target value and m is the number of elements in the array. The space complexity is O(N) due to the DP array. These complexities are within the expected limits as stated in the problem description.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
