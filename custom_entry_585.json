Now it's time to decide who gets to take all the gifts, you or the Grinch, there will be no splitting. So you and Grinch decide to play a game.\\nTo start the game, an Integer N will be given. The game is played in turns and for each turn, the player can make any one of the following moves:\\n- Divide N by any of it's odd divisors greater than 1.\\n- Subtract 1 from N if N is greater than 1.\\nDivisor of a number includes the number itself.\\nThe player who is unable to make a move loses the game.\\nSince you are the mastermind of the heist, you get to play the first move.\\n\\n-----Input-----\\nThe first line contains a single integer T (1 \u2264 T \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases.

Understand the two types of moves: dividing by an odd divisor greater than 1 and subtracting 1 (if N > 1).\\n- Identifying Winning and Losing States: Determine the conditions under which a player wins or loses. A player loses if they cannot make a move. The starting number N determines the complexity of the game.\\n- Considering Basic Game Theory: Analyze simple cases to find patterns. Consider how the moves available to a player depend on the prime factorization of N, especially the presence of odd divisors.\\n- Developing a Strategy: Explore strategies for both players, understanding when certain moves might lead to a winning position. Think about how to force the opponent into a losing position if possible.\\n- Edge Cases: Understand the base case scenarios, such as when N is 1 or 2, which directly determine the winner.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the possible moves when the number N is even, and how do these moves affect the outcome of the game?\",\n    \"What are the possible moves when the number N is odd, and how do these moves differ from the even case?\",\n    \"How does the prime factorization of N (specifically the odd factors) affect the available moves and the potential strategy?\",\n    \"What is the significance of N = 1 and N = 2, and how do they serve as base cases for determining the winner?\",\n    \"Can you think of scenarios or patterns that would guarantee a win for the first player (you) or the second player (Grinch)?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"When N is even, the possible moves are dividing by an odd divisor greater than 1 (if it exists) and subtracting 1. Subtracting 1 makes it odd. Dividing by an odd divisor reduces the number, potentially leading to a win if it puts the opponent in a losing state.\",\n    \"When N is odd, the only possible moves are dividing by an odd divisor greater than 1 (if it exists) and subtracting 1 if N > 1. Subtracting 1 makes it even.\",\n    \"The prime factorization of N, specifically its odd factors, directly influences the ability to divide N by an odd divisor. If N has no odd divisors greater than 1, the only available move is subtracting 1. The number of odd divisors affects the number of options a player has.\",\n    \"When N = 1, the first player (you) loses because there are no valid moves. When N = 2, the first player can subtract 1, resulting in N = 1, and forcing the second player (Grinch) to lose, hence you win.\",\n    \"If N is odd and not prime, you can divide by an odd factor. If N can be reduced to 1 by following some optimal number of moves for you, it guarantees a win for you.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
