Problem is simple, you have been given two numbers A and M and you have to find A%M and print it. \\n\\nInput Format\\n\\nFirstline: T, where T is the number of test cases.

Each subsequent line contains two space-separated integers, A and M.\\n- Parse the input: Read the number of test cases T, and then iterate T times, reading A and M in each iteration.\\n- Calculate the modulus: Compute A % M for each pair of A and M.\\n- Print the result: Print the calculated modulus to the console, followed by a newline character.\\n- Handle constraints: Ensure that your solution respects the specified constraints for T, the number of digits in A, and the range of M.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How should I handle the large input values for A, given the constraint on the number of digits in A?\",\n    \"What data type should I use for A and M to avoid potential integer overflow issues?\",\n    \"How can I optimize the input reading to avoid TLE (Time Limit Exceeded) issues?\",\n    \"What edge cases might I encounter, and how should I handle them?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Since A can have up to 5x10^5 digits, I should read it as a string. Then I will manually perform modulus operation.\",\n    \"I should use `int` to store M, since its maximum value is 10^9, which fits within the bounds of an integer.\",\n    \"I can use faster input methods (if using C++, use iostream::sync_with_stdio(false) and cin.tie(nullptr)) and minimize unnecessary string conversions to improve the input reading speed. For python, using fast I/O helps.\",\n    \"A edge case can be M=1, in that case A%M =0.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
