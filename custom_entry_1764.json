However for the well-known reasons (as you probably remember he is a very unusual dwarf and he cannot stand sunlight) Greg can only excavate at night. And in the morning he should be in his crypt before the first sun ray strikes. That's why he wants to find the shortest route from the excavation point to his crypt. Greg has recollected how the Codeforces participants successfully solved the problem of transporting his coffin to a crypt. So, in some miraculous way Greg appeared in your bedroom and asks you to help him in a highly persuasive manner. As usual, you didn't feel like turning him down.\\n\\nAfter some thought, you formalized the task as follows: as the Neverland mountain has a regular shape and ends with a rather sharp peak, it can be represented as a cone whose base radius equals r and whose height equals h. The graveyard where Greg is busy excavating and his crypt can be represented by two points on the cone's surface. All you've got to do is find the distance between points on the cone's surface. \\n\\nThe task is complicated by the fact that the mountain's base on the ground level and even everything below the mountain has been dug through by gnome (one may wonder whether they've been looking for the same stuff as Greg...). So, one can consider the shortest way to pass not only along the side surface, but also along the cone's base (and in a specific case both points can lie on the cone's base \u2014 see the first sample test)\\n\\nGreg will be satisfied with the problem solution represented as the length of the shortest path between two points \u2014 he can find his way pretty well on his own. He gave you two hours to solve the problem and the time is ticking!\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first input line contains space-separated integers r and h (1 \u2264 r, h \u2264 1000) \u2014 the base radius and the cone height correspondingly. The second and third lines contain coordinates of two points on the cone surface, groups of three space-separated real numbers. The coordinates of the points are given in the systems of coordinates where the origin of coordinates is located in the centre of the cone's base and its rotation axis matches the OZ axis. In this coordinate system the vertex of the cone is located at the point (0, 0, h), the base of the cone is a circle whose center is at the point (0, 0, 0), lying on the XOY plane, and all points on the cone surface have a non-negative coordinate z. It is guaranteed that the distances from the points to the cone surface do not exceed 10 - 12. All real numbers in the input have no more than 16 digits after decimal point.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nPrint the length of the shortest path between the points given in the input, with absolute or relative error not exceeding 10 -

When both points are on the surface, the shortest path could either be along the surface or by going down to the base and then up to the other point. If one point is on the base, then the shortest path will either be along the surface or by traveling along the base and up to the other point on the surface.\\n- Calculating Distances on the Cone's Surface: The distance along the surface involves \\\"unrolling\\\" the cone and finding the straight-line distance. This requires calculating angles and using trigonometric functions.\\n- Handling Base Paths: The shortest path along the base is simply the Euclidean distance between the projections of the points onto the base.\\n- Optimization and Iteration: The problem likely needs some form of numerical optimization since there might not be a direct closed-form solution to minimize the path length when a combination of cone surface and base paths are considered.  The provided solution uses an iterative approach to refine the angles and positions for shortest paths.\\n- Edge Cases and Special Conditions: Account for scenarios where the points are at the cone's vertex or center of the base, or when both points are on the base itself.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you represent the cone mathematically to facilitate distance calculations between points on its surface?\",\n    \"How does the problem change when one or both points lie on the base of the cone?\",\n    \"Can you describe the process of 'unrolling' the cone's surface and how this simplifies the distance calculation?\",\n    \"Given the iterative nature of the provided solution, what are the key parameters being optimized and how are they refined?\",\n    \"How do you handle cases where a point is at the vertex of the cone or at the center of its base?\",\n    \"What are the key differences in calculating the shortest distance when both points are on the cone's surface versus when one or both points are on the cone's base?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The cone can be represented by its radius `r`, height `h`, and points on its surface can be defined using cylindrical coordinates or converted to Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) where z is between 0 and h. The slant height l = sqrt(r^2 + h^2) is also a critical parameter.\",\n    \"If one or both points lie on the base, the shortest path could involve traversing part of the cone's surface and part of the base. The Euclidean distance on the base becomes a critical component to consider when calculating shortest distance, and must be compared against travelling strictly along the cone's surface.\",\n    \"Unrolling the cone transforms the surface into a sector of a circle with radius equal to the slant height `l` of the cone. The arc length of the sector is equal to the circumference of the cone's base (2*pi*r). This allows you to calculate distances along the surface as straight lines on the unrolled sector, using trigonometric relationships involving the central angle.\",\n    \"The iterative solution is optimizing angles (alf1, alf2) that define positions along the cone's surface and base. The angles are refined through successive iterations by narrowing the search space (step1, step2) around minimum values found in previous steps.\",\n    \"When a point is at the vertex (0, 0, h), its distance to any other point on the surface is a straight line along the cone's surface. When a point is at the center of the base (0, 0, 0), any point on the base is simply its Euclidean distance, whereas points on the surface will need to involve considering a path up the cone from the origin.\",\n    \"When both points are on the cone's surface, the shortest path involves comparing the distance along the surface (calculated using the unrolled cone representation) with a path that may involve traversing down to the base and up to the other point. When one or both points are on the base, the calculation must include distances along the base (Euclidean distance) combined with the path on the cone's surface up to the point that is not on the base.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
