This is because 5*5 = 25, and 25 * 5 = 125, and 125 * 5 = 625. So, 5^2 = 25.  5^3 = 125 (last two digits are 25), 5^4 = 625 (last two digits are 25). So if n >= 2, then the last two digits of 5^n is 25.\\n- Formulating the Solution: The solution simplifies to always printing 25 since the constraint specifies n >= 2.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"For N >= 2, what pattern do you observe in the last two digits of 5^N?\",\n    \"How do you handle the constraint that N is between 2 and 2 * 10^18?\",\n    \"Is there any computation required, or can we directly output the result based on the problem's nature?\",\n    \"What are the potential pitfalls of directly calculating 5^N for such a large range of N?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"For N >= 2, the last two digits of 5^N are always 25.\",\n    \"Since the last two digits are always 25 for N >= 2, the specific value of N within the given range is irrelevant for determining the answer.\",\n    \"We can directly output the result as 25 since N is greater than or equal to 2.  No other computations are needed.\",\n    \"Directly calculating 5^N would result in integer overflow, making it impossible to store the result accurately using standard integer types.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
