Entries are always positive ints, higher than zero.\\n\\nFarmer knows the total amount of sheep, this is a third parameter. You need to return the amount of sheep lost (not returned to the farm) after final sheep counting on Saturday.\\n\\nExample 1: Input: {1, 2}, {3, 4}, 15 --> Output: 5\\n\\nExample 2: Input: {3, 1, 2}, {4, 5}, 21 --> Output: 6\\n\\nGood luck! :-)\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def lostSheep(friday, saturday, total):\\n\\treturn total - sum(friday + saturday)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem describes a scenario where sheep return to a farm on Friday and Saturday nights.  We're given the counts of returning sheep for each night as arrays and the total number of sheep initially. The task is to calculate the number of sheep that are lost (i.e., not returned).\\n- Identifying Key Information: Note that sheep returning on Friday stay and are counted towards the total returned sheep.  Also, all input numbers are positive integers.\\n- Devising a Strategy:  The total number of returned sheep is the sum of the sheep returning on Friday and Saturday. Subtracting this sum from the initial total number of sheep will give the number of lost sheep.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: The problem states all entries are positive integers, so no need to error handle zero or negative values.  There are no other specified edge cases.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you calculate the total number of sheep returned to the farm?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the number of lost sheep given the total number of sheep and the total number of returned sheep?\",\n    \"What are the key data structures involved in this problem, and how are they used?\",\n    \"What assumptions are you making about the input data?\",\n    \"What should happen if the sum of returned sheep exceeds the total sheep? Does the problem definition prevent that from happening?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The total number of sheep returned is the sum of all sheep that returned on Friday and all sheep that returned on Saturday.\",\n    \"The number of lost sheep is calculated by subtracting the total number of returned sheep from the total number of sheep.\",\n    \"The key data structures are two lists representing the sheep returning on Friday and Saturday, and the total is represented by an integer. The lists are summed into single list for the calculation. The total represents the initial quantity of sheep.\",\n    \"I'm assuming that all inputs are valid, and the input arrays contain only positive integers.  I'm also assuming that it's mathematically possible to have lost sheep (total number of sheep > 0).\",\n    \"Based on the prompt, it seems like the problem implies that the total number of sheep returned would never exceed the total number of sheep, so if it did, it might be due to some error in the inputs.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
