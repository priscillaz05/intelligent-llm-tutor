For simplicity\u2019s sake, we can assume that all cards have a suit and a number.\\n\\n The suit of the card is one of the characters `\\\"P\\\", \\\"K\\\", \\\"H\\\", \\\"T\\\"`, and the number of the card is an integer between `1` and `13`. The robot labels each card in the format `TXY` where `T` is the suit and `XY` is the number. If the card\u2019s number consists of one digit, then X = 0. For example, the card of suit `\\\"P\\\"` and number `9` is labelled `\\\"P09\\\"`.\\n\\n A complete deck has `52` cards in total. For each of the four suits there is exactly one card with a number between `1` and `13`.\\n\\n The robot has read the labels of all the cards in the deck and combined them into the string `s`.\\n \\n Your task is to help Pero finish the robot by writing a program that reads the string made out of card labels and returns the number of cards that are missing for each suit.\\n\\n If there are two same cards in the deck, return array with `[-1, -1, -1, -1]` instead.\\n\\n# Input/Output\\n\\n\\n - `[input]` string `s`\\n\\n  A correct string of card labels. 0 \u2264 |S| \u2264 1000\\n\\n\\n - `[output]` an integer array\\n\\n  Array of four elements, representing the number of missing card of suits `\\\"P\\\", \\\"K\\\", \\\"H\\\", and \\\"T\\\"` respectively. If there are two same cards in the deck, return `[-1, -1, -1, -1]` instead.\\n\\n\\n# Example\\n\\n For `s = \\\"P01K02H03H04\\\"`, the output should be `[12, 12, 11, 13]`.\\n \\n `1` card from `\\\"P\\\"` suit, `1` card from `\\\"K\\\"` suit, `2` cards from `\\\"H\\\"` suit, no card from `\\\"T\\\"` suit.\\n \\n For `s = \\\"H02H10P11H02\\\"`, the output should be `[-1, -1, -1, -1]`.\\n \\n There are two same cards `\\\"H02\\\"` in the string `s`.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"from collections import defaultdict\\n\\ndef cards_and_pero(s):\\n\\tdeck = defaultdict(set)\\n\\tfor n in range(0, len(s), 3):\\n\\t\\tcard = s[n:n + 3]\\n\\t\\tif card[1:] in deck[card[0]]:\\n\\t\\t\\treturn [-1, -1, -1, -1]\\n\\t\\tdeck[card[0]] |= {card[1:]}\\n\\treturn [13 - len(deck[suit]) for suit in 'PKHT']\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires determining the number of missing cards for each suit in a given string of card labels. A complete deck has 13 cards for each of the four suits (P, K, H, T). If there are duplicate cards, the function should return [-1, -1, -1, -1].\\n- Data Extraction and Storage: Extract card information (suit and number) from the input string. Store the cards encountered in a suitable data structure (e.g., a dictionary of sets, where keys are suits and values are sets of card numbers). Sets are used to easily check for duplicates.\\n- Duplicate Detection: While extracting the cards, check for duplicates. If a duplicate is found, immediately return [-1, -1, -1, -1].\\n- Counting Missing Cards: After processing all the cards, calculate the number of missing cards for each suit by subtracting the number of cards found for that suit from 13.\\n- Returning the Result: Return the result as a list of four integers, representing the number of missing cards for each suit (P, K, H, T).\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you handle the extraction of the card's suit and number from the input string?\",\n    \"What data structure can you use to store the encountered cards, allowing you to easily detect duplicates?\",\n    \"How do you efficiently check for duplicates during the card extraction process?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the number of missing cards for each suit after processing all the cards in the input string?\",\n    \"What is the expected output if the input string contains duplicate cards?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The card label is always 3 characters long. You can extract the suit using string indexing `s[n]` and the number using `s[n+1:n+3]`.\",\n    \"A dictionary of sets is an efficient way to store the encountered cards.
