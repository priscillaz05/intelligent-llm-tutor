Let a is a permutation of an integers from 1 to n, inclusive, and ai denotes the i-th element of the permutation. The Little Elephant's recursive function f(x), that sorts the first x permutation's elements, works as follows:\\n\\n  * If x = 1, exit the function. \\n  * Otherwise, call f(x - 1), and then make swap(ax - 1, ax) (swap the x-th and (x - 1)-th elements of a). \\n\\nThe Little Elephant's teacher believes that this function does not work correctly. But that-be do not get an F, the Little Elephant wants to show the performance of its function. Help him, find a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, such that after performing the Little Elephant's function (that is call f(n)), the permutation will be sorted in ascending order.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nA single line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000) \u2014 the size of permutation.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nIn a single line print n distinct integers from 1 to n \u2014 the required permutation.

Observe that placing the largest number at the beginning can leverage the swaps to move it to the end.\\n- Constructing the Permutation: Start with a sorted list [1, 2, ..., n]. Move the last element (n) to the beginning, resulting in [n, 1, 2, ..., n-1]. This configuration ensures that after `f(n)` is executed, the array is sorted.\\n- Verifying the Approach: Test a few small values of 'n' to confirm the pattern. For n=2, the permutation [2, 1] results in a sorted array after the swap. For n=3, the permutation [3, 1, 2] will yield [1, 3, 2] then [1, 2, 3].\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does the recursive function f(x) modify the permutation?\",\n    \"What is the key idea to ensure the final array is sorted after calling f(n)?\",\n    \"Why does moving the largest element to the beginning of the sorted list lead to a sorted array after the swaps?\",\n    \"How can we construct the initial permutation from a sorted list to achieve the desired result?\",\n    \"What are some simple test cases to verify the approach?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The function f(x) sorts the first x elements by recursively calling f(x-1) and then swapping the (x-1)-th and x-th elements.\",\n    \"The key is to construct an initial permutation that, after the series of swaps in f(n), results in a sorted array.\",\n    \"Placing the largest number at the beginning allows it to be gradually moved to the end of the array through a series of swaps, which helps sort the array.\",\n    \"Start with a sorted list [1, 2, ..., n] and move the largest element 'n' to the beginning of the list, creating the permutation [n, 1, 2, ..., n-1].\",\n    \"For n=2, the permutation [2, 1] should result in a sorted array after the swap.
