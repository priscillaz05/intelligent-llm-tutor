Being smarter, faster and displaying more zeal for magic than any other student, one by one he managed to impress the three hidden witches of the school. They knew his secret desire to be a warrior, so each of them gave him some super power to use if he's up for a fight against one of his enemies. \\nThe first witch: She gave PandeyG the power to take away one unit of strength away from his enemies. - Eg 36 - 1 = 35.\\nThe second witch: Jealous of the first witch, the second one gave the kid the power to halfen the strength of his enemies. - Eg. \\\\frac{36}{2} = 18.\\nThe third witch: Even better, she gave him the power to reduce the strength of his enemies to one third of what it initially was. - Eg. \\\\frac{36}{3} = 12.\\n\\nThe witches, though, clearly told him that he'll be only able to use these powers if the strength of the opponent is an integer, otherwise not.\\n\\nSince, PandeyG is one smart kid, he knew that by using all three of the powers he has got, he'll be able to defeat every enemy he's ever going to face, sometime or the other, in some number of moves.\\n\\nNow, here's the twist: In spite of having all these powers, PandeyG was still losing matches against his enemies - because he was unable to use them  in the optimal fashion. To defeat an opponent, you need to make sure that the enemy has only 1 unit of strength left in him. \\n\\nGiven the value 'k' - k being the units of the enemy of PandeyG's strength, help PandeyG figure out the minimum number of magical hits he'll be needing to defeat his opponent, using his powers. \\n\\nInput Format:\\nThe first line represents the number of test cases, t.\\nFollowed by t lines - and on every line, a number n - with the strength unit of your enemy.\\n\\nOutput format:\\nFor every  number n, print the minimum number of hits needed to defeat his enemy by making his strength equal to 1.\\n\\nConstraints:\\n1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000.       \\n1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9.  \\n\\nSAMPLE INPUT\\n5\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n\\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n\\nExplanation\\n\\nIn the first test case, the enemy's power is already 1, so you will no move to defeat him.\\n\\nIn the second case, the enemy's power can be reduced to 1 simply by using the second witch's power - reducing 2 to 1, in one step.\\n\\nIn the third case, the enemy's power can be reduced to 1 in one step again using the third witch's power.\\n\\nIn the fourth case, PandeyG can reduce the enemy's power in 2 steps, by using his second power twice.\\n\\nIn the fifth case, there are two ways:\\nWay 1:\\nReduce 5 by 1 to make 4.\\nHalf it. \\\\frac{4}{2} = 2.\\nHalf it. \\\\frac{2}{2} = 1.\\n\\n3 steps.\\nWay 2:\\nReduce 5 by 1 to make it 4.\\nReduce 4 by 1 to make it 3.\\nReduce 3 to 1, by making it one third. \\\\frac{3}{3} = 1.\\n\\n3 steps.\\nIn any case, you need to print the MINIMUM number of steps needed.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def min_unit(table,unit):\\n\\tif unit < 10000001:\\n\\t\\treturn table[unit]\\n\\ttempunit=1000000\\n\\tif unit%2 == 0:\\n\\t\\ttempunit=min(tempunit,1+min_unit(table,unit/2))\\n\\tif unit%3 == 0:\\n\\t\\ttempunit=min(tempunit,1+min_unit(table,unit/3))\\n\\tif unit%2 != 0 or unit%3 != 0:\\n\\t\\ttempunit=min(tempunit,1+min_unit(table,unit -1))\\n\\treturn tempunit\\n\\t\\n\\ntest=int(input())\\ninputs=[int(input()) for i in range(0,test)]\\ntable=dict()\\ntable[0]=0\\ntable[1]=0\\ntable[2]=1\\ntable[3]=1\\nsize=max(inputs)+1\\ni=4\\nwhile i < 10000001 :\\n\\ttable[i]=((table[i-1]+1))\\n\\tif i%3 == 0 :\\n\\t\\ttable[i]=min(table[i/3]+1,table[i])\\n\\tif i%2 == 0 :\\n\\t\\ttable[i]=min(table[i/2]+1,table[i])\\n\\t\\t\\n\\ti+=1\\n\\nfor i in inputs:\\n\\tif i > 10000000 :\\n\\t\\tprint(min_unit(table,i))\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tprint(table[i])\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding Problem Constraints: The goal is to find the minimum number of steps to reduce a given integer 'k' to 1, using three operations: subtract 1, divide by 2 (if even), and divide by 3 (if divisible by 3).\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: The key is to consider all possible sequences of operations and choose the one with the minimum steps. A brute-force approach of trying all combinations will be too slow. Dynamic programming or recursion with memoization will be helpful to store the intermediate results to prevent recomputation.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Dynamic programming seems to be the way to go. We can build a table storing the minimum steps required to reach 1 from each number up to 'k'. Start with base cases (1, 2, and 3) and then iteratively compute the minimum steps for larger numbers using the given operations.\\n- Implementing Optimizations: When computing the minimum steps for a number, consider all three operations (subtract 1, divide by 2, and divide by 3), and choose the one that yields the minimum steps. Also, handle large inputs using the table effectively.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you handle the problem of finding the minimum number of steps, and what kind of algorithmic approach is suitable?\",\n    \"What are the base cases for the dynamic programming approach, and how do they influence the overall solution?\",\n    \"When computing the minimum steps for a number, which operations should you consider, and how do you ensure you're choosing the optimal one?\",\n    \"How would you optimize the space and time complexity of the algorithm to handle large inputs efficiently?\",\n    \"What edge cases should be considered, and how would you handle them in the code to ensure correctness?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"I would approach this as a dynamic programming problem to find the minimum number of operations required to reduce the number to 1. We can build a DP table storing minimum steps for each number.\",\n    \"The base cases are dp[0] = 0, dp[1] = 0, dp[2] = 1, and dp[3] = 1. They provide the initial known minimum steps that are crucial for building the solution iteratively.\",\n    \"For each number, I consider subtracting 1, dividing by 2 if the number is even, and dividing by 3 if the number is divisible by 3. The one which results in the fewest total operations should be chosen.\",\n    \"To optimize space, the DP table can be limited to a certain range and the rest can be computed using a recursive approach. We can optimize time by checking if an intermediate result exists or not.\",\n    \"Edge cases include handling inputs of 1 or very large numbers which may exceed the capacity of the table. Make sure k > 0.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
