The goal is to minimize the absolute difference between the sums of their card values.\\n- Constraints and Edge Cases: Identify that both Snuke and Raccoon must take at least one card. Consider the range of possible card values and the number of cards.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: Since the order matters (Snuke takes from the top), calculate the possible sums Snuke and Raccoon can have by iterating through all possible split points. Keep track of the minimum absolute difference found so far.\\n- Optimizing the Sum Calculation: Instead of recalculating sums at each split, maintain the sum of Snuke's cards (lsum) and the sum of Raccoon's cards (rsum) and update them incrementally.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for Snuke and Raccoon to divide the cards, and what constraints are placed on this division?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently calculate the sums of Snuke's and Raccoon's cards for each possible split?\",\n    \"What edge cases should you consider to ensure your solution is correct and efficient?\",\n    \"How can you minimize memory usage, especially when dealing with potentially large arrays?\",\n    \"What is the time complexity of your approach and how does it relate to the problem constraints?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Snuke takes some cards from the top of the heap, and Raccoon takes the remaining cards.
