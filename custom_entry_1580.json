Positive numbers are added to a database, and negative numbers (corresponding to a previously added positive number) are removed from the database.\\n- Data Structures Selection: A dictionary (or hash map) and a set are effective choices. The dictionary will store the counts of each number, allowing easy removal. The set helps maintain the distinct elements for efficient counting.\\n- Algorithm Design: Process each number in the stream. If positive, add it to the dictionary/set. If negative, check if its positive counterpart exists in the dictionary. If it does, decrement the count. If the count becomes zero, remove it from the set. After each operation, add the size of the set (distinct count) to the output list.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Ensure the code correctly handles cases when removing a number that is not present in the dictionary/set. Also, remember that only one instance of a negative number can remove one occurrence of a positive number. The set ensures distinct counting.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you efficiently keep track of the number of distinct elements after each operation in the stream?\",\n    \"How does the presence of both positive and negative numbers affect the choice of data structures?\",\n    \"What steps are involved when encountering a negative number in the stream, and how do you ensure proper removal and counting?\",\n    \"What is the importance of using a set in this problem, and how does it contribute to the overall efficiency?\",\n    \"What edge cases need to be considered, and how can the solution be made robust to handle those cases?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Using a set allows you to maintain unique elements easily. Each time you add or remove elements, you can efficiently update the count of distinct elements by checking the size of the set.\",\n    \"Since negative numbers represent removals of positive numbers, you need a data structure that allows efficient counting and removal. A dictionary is ideal for counting occurrences, and a set is useful for maintaining distinct values.\",\n    \"When encountering a negative number, check if its positive counterpart exists in the dictionary. If it does, decrement its count. If the count becomes zero, remove the positive number from both the dictionary and the set. Only if the positive counterpart is found will a removal affect the count.\",\n    \"A set is essential because it stores only distinct elements. By using a set, the code avoids counting duplicates and efficiently provides the number of distinct elements in O(1) time.\",\n    \"Edge cases include encountering a negative number that has no corresponding positive number in the dictionary. The solution should handle this gracefully, ensuring it doesn't cause errors and doesn't affect the count of distinct elements. Also, an empty array should be handled.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
