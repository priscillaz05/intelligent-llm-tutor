Also, identify the constraint that a flower can only be used in one bouquet.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Consider the edge case where there are not enough flowers (N < M * K) to make the required bouquets. Also, recognize the need for an efficient search algorithm to find the minimum number of days. The bloomDay values are quite large, so a linear search through them is not ideal.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: The problem can be solved using a binary search approach. The search space is between the minimum and maximum bloom days. For each mid-day value in the binary search, we check if it's possible to make M bouquets. If it is, we try to find a smaller day; otherwise, we increase the day. The total complexity should be O(N * log(maxVal)), as given in the prompt.\\n- Implementing the Bouquet Calculation: For a given mid-day, iterate through the bloomDay array and count the number of consecutive flowers that have bloomed on or before the mid-day. If the count reaches K, increment the number of bouquets and reset the count.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What should be returned if the total number of flowers is less than M * K?\",\n    \"What is the optimal search strategy given the range of bloomDay values, and why?\",\n    \"How do you check if it is possible to make M bouquets for a given number of days?\",\n    \"How do you handle the condition that flowers in a bouquet must be adjacent?\",\n    \"What are the start and end conditions for your binary search?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"If the total number of flowers (N) is less than M * K, it is impossible to make M bouquets, so return -1.\",\n    \"A binary search is optimal because we're looking for the minimum day that satisfies a condition, and the range of bloomDay values is large. Binary search has a logarithmic time complexity.\",\n    \"To check if it's possible to make M bouquets for a given number of days, iterate through the bloomDay array and count how many bouquets can be formed with flowers that have bloomed by that day. If the number of bouquets is greater than or equal to M, it is possible.\",\n    \"To ensure flowers in a bouquet are adjacent, maintain a counter for consecutive blooming flowers. Reset the counter whenever a flower that hasn't bloomed yet is encountered.\",\n    \"The binary search should start with the minimum and maximum values in the bloomDay array as the lower and upper bounds, respectively. The search continues as long as the lower bound is less than or equal to the upper bound.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
