His friend, Marmot, prepared him a nice game for lunch.\\n\\nMarmot brought Mole n ordered piles of worms such that i-th pile contains a_{i} worms. He labeled all these worms with consecutive integers: worms in first pile are labeled with numbers 1 to a_1, worms in second pile are labeled with numbers a_1 + 1 to a_1 + a_2 and so on. See the example for a better understanding.\\n\\nMole can't eat all the worms (Marmot brought a lot) and, as we all know, Mole is blind, so Marmot tells him the labels of the best juicy worms. Marmot will only give Mole a worm if Mole says correctly in which pile this worm is contained.\\n\\nPoor Mole asks for your help. For all juicy worms said by Marmot, tell Mole the correct answers.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5), the number of piles.\\n\\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^3, a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{n} \u2264 10^6), where a_{i} is the number of worms in the i-th pile.\\n\\nThe third line contains single integer m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^5), the number of juicy worms said by Marmot.\\n\\nThe fourth line contains m integers q_1, q_2, ..., q_{m} (1 \u2264 q_{i} \u2264 a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{n}), the labels of the juicy worms.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nPrint m lines to the standard output.

The last worm label in the i-th pile is the sum of the number of worms in the first i piles.\",\n    \"Binary search helps by efficiently narrowing down the range of possible piles where the worm label could be, ultimately finding the correct pile in logarithmic time.\",\n    \"Consider cases like empty input or invalid pile sizes, although problem constraints limit this. Also consider a pile size of 1. Binary search algorithm needs to be correct to work with these edge cases. No explicit handling needed.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
