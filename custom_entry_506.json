The snake pattern alternates the direction of traversal for each row: left-to-right for even rows and right-to-left for odd rows.\\n- Data Structures: Understand that the resultant snake pattern should be stored in a list.\\n- Algorithm Selection: Iterate through each row of the matrix. Check if the row index is even or odd. If even, append the row as is to the resultant list. If odd, reverse the row before appending it to the resultant list.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Consider an empty matrix as a possible edge case. The code should work correctly for N=1.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the primary requirement of the problem and how does the snake pattern traversal work?\",\n    \"How can you determine the direction of traversal (left-to-right or right-to-left) for each row?\",\n    \"Which data structure is best suited to store the elements visited in the snake pattern, and why?\",\n    \"How do you reverse a row in Python?\",\n    \"How would your solution handle an empty matrix or a matrix with only one row/column?\",\n    \"What would be the time and space complexity of your solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The primary requirement is to traverse the matrix in a snake-like pattern and return the elements in the order they are visited. The snake pattern means that even-indexed rows are traversed from left to right, while odd-indexed rows are traversed from right to left.\",\n    \"The direction of traversal can be determined by checking if the row index is even or odd. Even rows should be traversed from left to right, and odd rows should be traversed from right to left.\",\n    \"A list is best suited to store the elements because it maintains the order in which elements are visited, and the problem requires returning elements in a specific order.\",\n    \"You can reverse a row in Python using slicing with a step of -1 (row[::-1]).\",\n    \"For an empty matrix, the function should return an empty list. For a matrix with only one row, it will return the same elements in the row. For one column it depends on N, for even number of N the first element would be on top, if N is odd, then the first element would be on bottom.\",\n    \"The time complexity of the solution is O(N*N) because each element of the matrix is visited once. The space complexity is also O(N*N) since the size of result list depends on the number of elements in the matrix.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
