A '?' can be replaced by any lowercase letter.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints: The strings are of equal length, and we need to check if any possible replacements of '?' can make the strings identical.\\n- Developing a Matching Strategy: Iterate through the strings, comparing characters at each position. If both characters are not '?', they must be equal for a match to be possible. If they are different, no match is possible. If at least one of the characters is a '?', then it is potentially possible to match.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Consider the case where either string contains no '?' characters. In such a case, direct comparison determines whether a match is possible.\\n- Implementing the Algorithm: Loop through the strings character by character. If at any index, both characters are not '?' and they are not equal, the strings cannot be matched.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the significance of the '?' character in the input strings?\",\n    \"How should we handle the comparison when both characters at a given index are not '?'?\",\n    \"What conditions would immediately disqualify the strings from being matched?\",\n    \"If one or both characters at an index are '?', does this guarantee a match?\",\n    \"What data structure can you maintain while iterating over both of the strings at the same time.\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The '?' character is a wildcard that can be replaced by any single lowercase English letter.\",\n    \"If both characters are not '?', we should compare them directly. If they are equal, we proceed to the next character; if not, the strings cannot be matched.\",\n    \"The strings cannot be matched if at any index, both characters are not '?' and they are different.\",\n    \"No, it doesn't guarantee a match. It just means that a match is still possible at that index. We should continue checking the other indices. The flag ensures that it is a match only after the entire string has been processed.\",\n    \"A flag.
