He has some land where he starts growing sugarcane. At the end of the season he grew N sugarcanes. Is Appu satisfied??. No,\\nHe wants all his sugar canes to be of the same height. He goes to the nearby market .He finds a powder which when applied to one of his sugarcanes will double the height of that sugar cane. Now he needs to find out whether is it possible to make all the sugarcanes of the same height . Oh No!! Again maths.\\nPlease help him to find whether is it possible make all the sugar cane of the same height?\\n\\nInput \\n        First line contains N - the number of sugarcanes.Next N lines contains heights of sugarcanes seperated by space\\n\\nOutput\\n        Print \\\"YES\\\" if  it is possible make all the sugar cane of the same height or \\n    \\\"NO\\\" otherwise (quotes only for clarity)\\n\\nConstraints\\n        1 \u2264 N \u2264 50 \\n         Initial Height of  all sugarcanes will be between 1 and 1,000,000,000, inclusive.\\n\\nSAMPLE INPUT\\n2\\n1 23\\n\\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\\nNO\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"s = int(input())\\nx = input()\\narr=x.split(' ')\\narr = [int(i) for i in arr] # Another method arr=map(int,results)\\nflag=1\\ni=0\\nwhile(i < len(arr)):\\n\\twhile(arr[i]%2==0):\\n\\t\\tarr[i]=arr[i]/2\\n\\tif(i==0):\\n\\t\\tans=arr[i]\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tif(ans!=arr[i]):\\n\\t\\t\\tflag=0\\n\\ti=i+1\\nif(flag==1):\\n print(\\\"YES\\\")\\nelse:\\n print(\\\"NO\\\") \\n   \\n   \",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The goal is to determine if a list of sugarcane heights can be made equal by repeatedly doubling individual heights. This is equivalent to checking if all numbers can be transformed to the same value by multiplying by powers of 2.\\n- Simplifying the Problem: Dividing each height by 2 until it's odd will reveal the base height. If all base heights are equal, the answer is YES; otherwise, it's NO.\\n- Algorithm Choice: Iterate through the heights, repeatedly dividing each by 2 until it's odd. Compare each base height to the first base height encountered. If any differ, return NO. If all are equal, return YES.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the core requirement to make all sugarcane heights equal using only doubling operations?\",\n    \"How can you determine if two numbers can be made equal by only doubling one of them?\",\n    \"What is the significance of repeatedly dividing each height by 2 until it is odd?\",\n    \"How do you handle the input and output according to the problem description?\",\n    \"What are the potential edge cases or constraints to consider when implementing the solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The core requirement is that all sugarcane heights must be convertible to the same value by some number of doubling operations applied to each individual height.\",\n    \"Two numbers can be made equal by doubling only one of them if, after repeatedly dividing both by 2 until they are odd, the resulting odd numbers are equal.\",\n    \"Repeatedly dividing each height by 2 until it is odd effectively removes all powers of 2 from the number, leaving the base odd number. This is crucial for determining if all numbers can be transformed to a common value.\",\n    \"The input consists of the number of sugarcanes N, followed by a line containing the heights of the sugarcanes separated by spaces. The output should be \\\"YES\\\" if the heights can be made equal and \\\"NO\\\" otherwise.\",\n    \"Potential edge cases include when the input is invalid or the heights are very large, but the constraints indicate valid input and manageable sizes. The primary concern is efficiently determining the base height of each sugarcane.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
