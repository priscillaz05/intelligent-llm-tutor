If the powered number is greater than the total, return the current count. If the powered number is less than the total, recursively call the function by either including or excluding the current number's Nth power.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: A recursive approach with backtracking can be used.  The recursion explores whether to include or exclude the current number's Nth power in the sum. The base cases terminate the recursion when a valid sum is found or the current number exceeds the target.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the base case for the recursion, and when should the recursion terminate?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: The recursion should terminate when the current sum equals the target number X, indicating a valid combination.
