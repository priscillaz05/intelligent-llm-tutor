Recently they've received a response $t$ which they believe to be a response from aliens! The scientists now want to check if the signal $t$ is similar to $s$.\\n\\nThe original signal $s$ was a sequence of zeros and ones (everyone knows that binary code is the universe-wide language). The returned signal $t$, however, does not look as easy as $s$, but the scientists don't give up! They represented $t$ as a sequence of English letters and say that $t$ is similar to $s$ if you can replace all zeros in $s$ with some string $r_0$ and all ones in $s$ with some other string $r_1$ and obtain $t$. The strings $r_0$ and $r_1$ must be different and non-empty.\\n\\nPlease help Arkady's friend and find the number of possible replacements for zeros and ones (the number of pairs of strings $r_0$ and $r_1$) that transform $s$ to $t$.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains a string $s$ ($2 \\\\le |s| \\\\le 10^5$) consisting of zeros and ones\\u00a0\\u2014 the original signal.\\n\\nThe second line contains a string $t$ ($1 \\\\le |t| \\\\le 10^6$) consisting of lowercase English letters only\\u00a0\\u2014 the received signal.\\n\\nIt is guaranteed, that the string $s$ contains at least one '0' and at least one '1'.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nPrint a single integer\\u00a0\\u2014 the number of pairs of strings $r_0$ and $r_1$ that transform $s$ to $t$.\\n\\nIn case there are no such pairs, print $0$.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n01\\naaaaaa\\n\\nOutput\\n4\\n\\nInput\\n001\\nkokokokotlin\\n\\nOutput\\n2\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first example, the possible pairs $(r_0, r_1)$ are as follows:  \\\"a\\\", \\\"aaaaa\\\"  \\\"aa\\\", \\\"aaaa\\\"  \\\"aaaa\\\", \\\"aa\\\"  \\\"aaaaa\\\", \\\"a\\\"  \\n\\nThe pair \\\"aaa\\\", \\\"aaa\\\" is not allowed, since $r_0$ and $r_1$ must be different.\\n\\nIn the second example, the following pairs are possible:   \\\"ko\\\", \\\"kokotlin\\\"  \\\"koko\\\", \\\"tlin\\\"\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def gethash(l, r):\\n\\treturn (ha[r] - ha[l] * p[r - l] % mod + mod) % mod\\n\\ndef check(lenx, leny):\\n\\tha_0 = -1\\n\\tha_1 = -1\\n\\tj = 0\\n\\tfor i in range(m):\\n\\t\\tif s[i] == '0':\\n\\t\\t\\ttmp = gethash(j, j + lenx)\\n\\t\\t\\tif ha_0 == -1:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tha_0 = tmp\\n\\t\\t\\telif ha_0 != tmp:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn 0\\n\\t\\t\\tj += lenx\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\ttmp = gethash(j, j + leny)\\n\\t\\t\\tif ha_1 == -1:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tha_1 = tmp\\n\\t\\t\\telif ha_1 != tmp:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn 0\\n\\t\\t\\tj += leny\\n\\treturn ha_0 != ha_1\\ns = list(input())\\nt = list(input())\\nm = len(s)\\nn = len(t)\\np = [1]\\nbas = 2333\\nmod = (1 << 50) - 2\\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\\n\\tp.append(p[i - 1] * bas % mod)\\nha = [0]\\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\\n\\tha.append((ha[i - 1] * bas + ord(t[i - 1])) % mod)\\ncnt_0 = 0\\ncnt_1 = 0\\nfor x in s:\\n\\tif x == '0':\\n\\t\\tcnt_0 += 1\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tcnt_1 += 1\\nans = 0\\nfor i in range(1, n // cnt_0 + 1):\\n\\tj = n - cnt_0 * i\\n\\tif j % cnt_1 == 0 and j != 0:\\n\\t\\tj //= cnt_1\\n\\t\\tans += check(i, j)\\nprint(ans)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem asks us to find how many ways we can replace '0' and '1' in the binary string 's' with non-empty, distinct strings $r_0$ and $r_1$ respectively, to obtain the string 't'.\\n- Identifying Constraints: The key constraints are that $r_0$ and $r_1$ must be different and non-empty. The string 's' consists of '0's and '1's and contains at least one of each character.\\n- Devising a Strategy: We can iterate through possible lengths for $r_0$. For each possible length of $r_0$, we can calculate the required length of $r_1$. Then we must check if this assignment is valid, meaning we can actually construct $t$ in that way. Finally, we make sure that $r_0$ and $r_1$ are actually different. Note that we need to count occurrences of '0's and '1's in 's'.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: We must consider the cases where the calculated length of $r_1$ is zero or negative. We must ensure the lengths of r0 and r1 are valid.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do I determine the possible lengths for the replacement strings r0 and r1, given the lengths of s and t?\",\n    \"How can I efficiently verify whether a particular combination of lengths for r0 and r1 is valid?\",\n    \"What are the key criteria to consider when validating if the replacement strings, r0 and r1, can indeed construct the string t?\",\n    \"How do I ensure that r0 and r1 are different strings when testing a solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Iterate through possible lengths of $r_0$. Since $t$ must be entirely constructed by $r_0$ and $r_1$, use the counts of zeros and ones to derive the length of $r_1$. Specifically, if $len(r_0) = i$, and number of 0s in s is count0 and number of 1s in s is count1, then $len(t) = count0 * i + count1 * len(r_1)$, so $len(r_1) = (len(t) - count0 * i) / count1$. Also, i should vary between 1 to len(t) / count0 + 1.\",\n    \"Iterate through the string $s$. For each '0', extract the substring of length $len(r_0)$ in $t$ at the appropriate position. For each '1', extract the substring of length $len(r_1)$ in $t$. Compare all $r_0$ substrings to see if they are identical and do the same for r1. This allows to check if the proposed assignment is possible.\",\n    \"First, that all occurrences of '0' in s match the extracted $r_0$ substring and all occurrences of '1' in s match the extracted $r_1$ substring. Secondly, that the substrings for '0' and '1' cover the entire string $t$ without any leftovers or mismatches.\",\n    \"After extracting r0 and r1 (based on the counts of zeros and ones in s), compare the two strings to ensure they are not identical.
