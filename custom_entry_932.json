This means we're looking for pairs where one box can fit inside another.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: Sorting the boxes makes it easier to find suitable pairs because we can iterate from largest to smallest and easily check if there's a smaller box that fits inside. We can use a greedy approach to minimize the remaining boxes.\\n- Implementation Details: First, sort the array of box sizes. Iterate through the sorted array from the largest to smallest. For each box, search for the smallest available box that it can contain (i.e., a box whose size is at least twice the size of the current box). If such a box is found, pair them and remove them from consideration. Finally, count the remaining boxes.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the constraints regarding how boxes can be placed inside each other?\",\n    \"How would sorting the array of box sizes simplify finding pairs of boxes that can be nested?\",\n    \"How can the constraint that each box can only contain one box be handled during the pairing process?\",\n    \"What is the edge case if no box exists that can contain the current box?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the final number of remaining boxes after performing the maximum number of nestings?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Each box can contain at most one other box, and a box that contains another box cannot itself be placed inside a third box.\",\n    \"Sorting allows us to easily find suitable pairs using a greedy approach. By iterating from the largest to smallest box, we can efficiently find the smallest available box to place inside it.\",\n    \"When a box is placed inside another, both boxes should be marked or removed from the list of available boxes to ensure they are not considered for future pairings.\",\n    \"If no larger box exists that can contain the current smaller box (i.e., no box with a size at least twice that of the current box), the current box remains and cannot be placed inside any other box.\",\n    \"The final number of remaining boxes is the number of boxes that have not been placed inside any other box after performing the maximum possible number of nestings.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
