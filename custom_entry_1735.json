Each pixel can have one of $26$ different colors, denoted by lowercase Latin letters.\\n\\nYou want to recolor some of the pixels of the image so that all $4$ pixels have the same color. In one move, you can choose no more than two pixels of the same color and paint them into some other color (if you choose two pixels, both should be painted into the same color).\\n\\nWhat is the minimum number of moves you have to make in order to fulfill your goal?\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$) \u2014 the number of test cases.\\n\\nEach test case consists of two lines.

Based on the maximum occurrence and specific combinations, we can compute the minimum moves required.\\n- Consider Edge Cases: The problem statement handles the edge cases already (e.g., empty input is not possible as input is always 2x2).\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What conditions determine when zero moves are needed?\",\n    \"How many moves are needed if exactly three pixels have the same color?\",\n    \"How do you decide the number of moves when two pixels are of one color and two are of another color?\",\n    \"How many moves are required if each of the four pixels has a distinct color?\",\n    \"Can you explain the logic behind using the counts of each color to derive the number of moves?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Zero moves are needed if all four pixels have the same color.\",\n    \"If exactly three pixels have the same color, only one move is needed.\",\n    \"If two pixels are the same color, and the other two pixels are different colors, then two moves are needed to consolidate all colors.
