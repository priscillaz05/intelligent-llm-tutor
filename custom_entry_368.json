We need to keep track of the minimum value in each subtree.\\n- Handling Base Cases: Consider what happens when we reach a null node or a leaf node. A null node should return positive infinity as the minimum possible value. A leaf node will return its own data and the current max difference found.\\n- Finding the Minimum Descendant and Updating the Result: When visiting a node, we can update the maximum difference found so far by comparing the node's value with the minimum value found in its left and right subtrees.\\n- Returning Minimum Value: Each recursive call will return the minimum value found in the subtree rooted at that node and the updated maximum difference.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does the problem mean by 'A is an ancestor of B', and how does it influence the choice of algorithm?\",\n    \"How would you approach the problem recursively, and what information needs to be passed during each recursive call?\",\n    \"What are the base cases for the recursion, and what values should be returned in each of these cases?\",\n    \"How do you update the maximum difference as you traverse the tree, and what values should you compare to determine if an update is needed?\",\n    \"How do you handle the cases where a subtree might contain negative values, and how does it affect the minimum value calculations?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A is an ancestor of B means that node A is on the path from the root to node B. This means we can use recursion to traverse down the tree from each node to its descendants to find the minimum value in the subtrees and calculate the difference.\",\n    \"I would approach the problem recursively by traversing the tree. Each recursive call would need to pass the current node and the maximum difference found so far. Additionally, we would need to return the minimum value found in the subtree to the calling function.\",\n    \"The base cases are when we reach a null node and a leaf node. For a null node, we return positive infinity (math.inf) as the minimum value and the current maximum difference. For a leaf node, we return the node's value as the minimum and current maximum difference.\",\n    \"As we traverse the tree, for each node, we find the minimum value in its left and right subtrees. The maximum difference is then updated as the maximum of the current maximum difference and the difference between the current node's value and the minimum value found in the subtrees. result = max(result, root.data - min(min_left, min_right)).\",\n    \"Since we are looking for the maximum difference, we keep track of the minimum value in each subtree. Negative values in the subtree would still contribute to calculating a potentially larger difference when subtracted from an ancestor node's value, so no special handling is required.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
