The description of T test cases follows.\\n- The first and only line of each test case contains an integer N, as described in the problem statement. \\n\\n------ Output Format ------ \\n\\nFor each test case, output the number of liters of water required by the water cooler to cool for N hours. \\n\\n------ Constraints ------ \\n\\n$1 \u2264 T \u2264 1000$\\n$1 \u2264 N \u2264 1000$\\n\\n----- Sample Input 1 ------ \\n2\\n1\\n2\\n----- Sample Output 1 ------ \\n2\\n4\\n\\n----- explanation 1 ------ \\nTest case $1$: As mentioned in the problem statement, $2$ liters of water is required by the water cooler to cool for $1$ hour. \\n\\nTest case $2$: $4$ liters of water is required by the water cooler to cool for $2$ hours.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"t = int(input())\\nfor i in range(t):\\n\\tx = int(input())\\n\\tprint(x * 2)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem asks to calculate the total water needed for a cooler to cool for N hours, given that it requires 2 liters per hour.\\n- Reading Inputs: Read the number of test cases T. For each test case, read the number of hours N.\\n- Calculation: Multiply N by 2 to get the total water required.\\n- Output: Print the calculated water required for each test case.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the relationship between the number of hours and the water required?\",\n    \"What are the constraints on the input values, and how do they affect the solution?\",\n    \"How do you handle multiple test cases?\",\n    \"What data types should you use for input and output?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The water required is directly proportional to the number of hours. Each hour requires 2 liters of water.\",\n    \"The number of test cases and the number of hours are both between 1 and 1000. This means we can safely use integers without worrying about overflow.\",\n    \"To handle multiple test cases, you should read the number of test cases first, and then loop through each case, reading the input and printing the output for each.\",\n    \"Use integers for both input and output. The input number of hours (N) is an integer, and the resulting water required (2*N) is also an integer.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
