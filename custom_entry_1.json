The $i$-th box contains $r_i$ candies, candies have the color $c_i$ (the color can take one of three values \u200b\u200b\u2014 red, green, or blue). All candies inside a single box have the same color (and it is equal to $c_i$).\\n\\nInitially, Tanya is next to the box number $s$. Tanya can move to the neighbor box (that is, with a number that differs by one) or eat candies in the current box. Tanya eats candies instantly, but the movement takes one second.\\n\\nIf Tanya eats candies from the box, then the box itself remains in place, but there is no more candies in it. In other words, Tanya always eats all the candies from the box and candies in the boxes are not refilled.\\n\\nIt is known that Tanya cannot eat candies of the same color one after another (that is, the colors of candies in two consecutive boxes from which she eats candies are always different). In addition, Tanya's appetite is constantly growing, so in each next box from which she eats candies, there should be strictly more candies than in the previous one.\\n\\nNote that for the first box from which Tanya will eat candies, there are no restrictions on the color and number of candies.\\n\\nTanya wants to eat at least $k$ candies. What is the minimum number of seconds she will need? Remember that she eats candies instantly, and time is spent only on movements.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains three integers $n$, $s$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 50$, $1 \\le s \\le n$, $1 \\le k \\le 2000$) \u2014 number of the boxes, initial position of Tanya and lower bound on number of candies to eat. The following line contains $n$ integers $r_i$ ($1 \\le r_i \\le 50$) \u2014 numbers of candies in the boxes. The third line contains sequence of $n$ letters 'R', 'G' and 'B', meaning the colors of candies in the correspondent boxes ('R' for red, 'G' and 'B' for blue). Recall that each box contains candies of only one color. The third line contains no spaces.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nPrint minimal number of seconds to eat at least $k$ candies.

She starts at box $s$. She can move to adjacent boxes, which takes 1 second per move. Eating candies is instant. She cannot eat candies of the same color consecutively, and the number of candies eaten must strictly increase with each box.\\n- Edge cases and constraints: $1 \\\\le n \\\\le 50$, $1 \\\\le s \\\\le n$, $1 \\\\le k \\\\le 2000$, $1 \\\\le r_i \\\\le 50$. If no solution exists, return -1. The problem requires minimizing the travel time.\\n- Algorithmic Approach: Dynamic programming is well-suited for this problem. We can define a DP state `dp[remaining_candies][current_box]` representing the minimum time to have `remaining_candies` left to eat, ending at `current_box`. The transitions involve either moving to a different box and eating from it, or determining that no solution exists. Initialize dp table with infinity and then iterate from $k$ down to $0$ to determine optimal substructure values.\\n- Initialization: The base cases involve calculating the time needed to eat from the starting box directly. If eating from the start meets $k$, then we found an answer. Else, calculate the initial time it takes to get to other boxes, and reduce the remaining candy count.\\n- Iteration: The iteration will involve picking the colors from available boxes and choosing to travel to them. Determine the minimum time needed for Tanya to finish all candies by travelling to each one by one.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the constraints on the number of candies Tanya can eat from each box, and how does it impact the decision-making process?\",\n    \"How can the initial position of Tanya affect the optimal solution, and what steps must be taken to account for this?\",\n    \"In the dynamic programming approach, what does each state represent, and how do we transition between them?\",\n    \"How can you ensure that Tanya does not eat candies of the same color consecutively, and what checks must be implemented?\",\n    \"How to deal with the constraints of memory usage with large k and n?\",\n    \"Can greedy approach be used instead of DP?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Tanya must eat more candies than in the previous box, and she cannot eat from boxes with the same color consecutively.
