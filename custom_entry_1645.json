For example factorial of a number n in dreamland is defined as (n!)! (double factorial )\\n\\nSince Kuldeep is facinated with factorials in real life, he takes upon himself to find out values of factorials in dreamland, and because the answers can be very large, he is only interested in calculating double factorial mod 10^M(^ is power operator not xor operator).\\n\\nYour task is to help him to find out the answer .\\n\\nInput : \\n\\nFirst line of input file contain integer T (number of test cases) and next T lines contains two integers N and M.\\n\\nOutput: \\n\\nOutput the value  (N!)! modulo 10^M  (here ^ is used for power operator not xor operator) .\\n\\nConstraints:\\n\\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 100000\\n0 \u2264 N \u2264 10^6\\n0 \u2264 M \u2264 19\\n\\nSAMPLE INPUT\\n2\\n1 4\\n1 2\\n\\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\\n1\\n1\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import math\\nt=eval(input())\\nwhile t:\\n\\tn,m=list(map(int, input().split()))\\n\\tif ( m == 0 ):\\n\\t\\tprint(0)\\t\\n\\telse :\\n\\t\\tif (n>4):\\n\\t\\t\\tprint(0)\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tlol = (math.factorial(math.factorial(n))) % (10**m)\\n\\t\\t\\tprint(lol)\\n\\tt=t-1\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem asks to calculate (N!)! mod 10^M where N! is the standard factorial and (N!)! represents the factorial of N!.\\n- Identifying Constraints and Edge Cases: Consider the constraints 1 \u2264 T \u2264 100000, 0 \u2264 N \u2264 10^6, and 0 \u2264 M \u2264 19. Handle potential overflow issues by taking the modulo at each step, especially when computing factorials.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Calculate the factorial of N, then calculate the factorial of the result, and finally take the modulo 10^M. Optimize for cases where N is large, as (N!)! will become very large very quickly. Consider the case where N! will have a factor of 5 and a factor of 2 leading to trailing zeroes.\\n- Implementing Optimizations: Realize that if n >= 5, then n! will have a factor of 5 and a factor of 2, implying n! is a multiple of 10. Therefore (n!)! will have very many trailing zeroes and if the number of trailing zeroes exceeds M, (n!)! mod 10^M will be zero. \\n\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the dreamland factorial, and how does it differ from the standard factorial?\",\n    \"How do I handle the modulo operation with large factorials to prevent overflow?\",\n    \"What are the key constraints that could help me reduce redundant computations?\",\n    \"How do I identify when the result will always be zero based on the given constraints?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Dreamland factorial of n is defined as (n!)!, meaning the factorial of the factorial of n.\",\n    \"Apply the modulo operation (10^M) after each factorial calculation.
