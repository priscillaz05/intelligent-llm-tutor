The sum of terms in each block follows a geometric progression. The signs s_i are either +1 or -1, based on the input string.\\n- Choosing Algorithmic Approach: Calculate the value of each term s_i * a^(n-i) * b^i modulo (10^9 + 9). Recognize the geometric progression within each block. Compute the modular inverse of a^k using Fermat's Little Theorem.\\n- Implementation Details: Precompute necessary values like a^n, b^n modulo (10^9 + 9). Properly handle the signs (+ or -). Correctly calculate the modular inverse using the fast powering algorithm (pow(a, mod - 2, mod)). Calculate the overall sum term by term within each block to avoid integer overflows.
