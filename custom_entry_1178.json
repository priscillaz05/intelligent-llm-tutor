Then, the panels adjacent to it get paused one second later, the panels adjacent to those get paused $2$ seconds later, and so on. In other words, if you pause panel $x$, panel $y$ (for all valid $y$) would be paused exactly $|x\u2212y|$ seconds later.\\n\\nFor example, suppose there are $4$ panels, and the $3$-rd panel is paused when the digit $9$ is on it.\\n\\nThe panel $1$ pauses $2$ seconds later, so it has the digit $1$;\\n\\nthe panel $2$ pauses $1$ second later, so it has the digit $0$;\\n\\nthe panel $4$ pauses $1$ second later, so it has the digit $0$.\\n\\nThe resulting $4$-digit number is $1090$.

The value on each panel increases every second, and pausing a panel freezes its digit. Pausing one panel initiates a ripple effect, pausing adjacent panels with increasing delays. The objective is to find the optimal panel to pause initially to achieve the largest possible $n$-digit number.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints: The number of panels, $n$, is a crucial input that determines the length of the output number. The delay in pausing adjacent panels, governed by the absolute difference in panel indices, dictates the digit displayed on each panel when it is paused. We need to maximize the overall value of the combined digits.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: A greedy approach appears appropriate. Start by considering pausing the first few panels and observe the pattern. When $n=1$, pausing the first panel at 9 yields the maximum result. When $n=2$, pausing the second panel at 8 yields 98. For larger $n$, the first three digits are likely '989', so the logic is to construct the string based on this observation.\\n- Implementation Details: The implementation should handle small values of $n$ as base cases (1 and 2). For $n>2$, construct the string starting with '989' and then repeat the string '0123456789' as many times as possible. The remaining digits are handled using the modulo operator.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the main goal of the problem, and what are the constraints?\",\n    \"What happens to the panels adjacent to the initially paused panel, and how does the pausing delay work?\",\n    \"For small values of $n$ (e.g., 1 and 2), what are the optimal solutions, and how can that help determine the pattern for larger $n$?\",\n    \"How would you construct the $n$-digit number after determining the digits displayed on each panel?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The main goal is to maximize the $n$-digit number by strategically pausing one of the $n$ digital panels. The constraints involve the delay in pausing adjacent panels, where the delay is equal to the absolute difference in their positions.\",\n    \"The panels adjacent to the initially paused panel pause one second later. This ripple effect continues outwards, with panels at distance $k$ pausing $k$ seconds later.\",\n    \"For $n=1$, the optimal solution is 9. For $n=2$, the optimal solution is 98. This suggests a pattern where we want larger digits at the beginning. The first three digits are often '989'.\",\n    \"After determining the digits displayed on each panel, write the digits from left to right to form the $n$-digit number.
