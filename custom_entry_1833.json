Every block is a cube with positive integer length of side.\\n\\nA block with side a has volume a3. A tower consisting of blocks with sides a1, a2, ..., ak has the total volume a13 + a23 + ... + ak3.\\n\\nLimak is going to build a tower. First, he asks you to tell him a positive integer X \u2014 the required total volume of the tower. Then, Limak adds new blocks greedily, one by one. Each time he adds the biggest block such that the total volume doesn't exceed X.\\n\\nLimak asks you to choose X not greater than m. Also, he wants to maximize the number of blocks in the tower at the end (however, he still behaves greedily). Secondarily, he wants to maximize X.\\n\\nCan you help Limak?

If there are multiple such X, we choose the largest one.\\n- Identifying Core Logic:  The number of blocks added depends on the largest cube less than or equal to the remaining volume.  A recursive approach might be useful to explore different choices of X.\\n- Handling Constraints: m can be as large as 10^15.  This suggests that a simple iterative approach trying all X from 1 to m is not feasible. Efficient computation of cube roots is necessary.\\n- Optimizing the Approach: Dynamic programming or memoization might be needed in conjunction with recursion to avoid recomputing the same values.\\n- Edge Cases and Base Cases: Small values of m should be handled carefully. For very small values of x, we may be able to directly determine the number of blocks and X.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you efficiently calculate the cube root of a number without using the `math.pow` or `**` operator directly?\",\n    \"What is the base case for a recursive or dynamic programming solution for this problem?\",\n    \"How would you compare two possible values of X to determine which one yields more blocks, and if they yield the same number of blocks, which one to choose?\",\n    \"For a given volume X, how do you simulate the greedy block addition process to determine the number of blocks used?\",\n    \"How can you optimize the search for the optimal X, given that m can be very large (up to 10^15)?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Binary search or an iterative approach with integer arithmetic can be used to find the integer cube root.\",\n    \"The base case would involve small values of X (e.g., X <= 7) for which we can directly determine the optimal number of blocks and the corresponding value of X.\",\n    \"First, compare the number of blocks.

Consider a divide-and-conquer strategy or a more targeted search based on the properties of cube numbers.
