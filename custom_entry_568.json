The input provides the size of the string list N, the list of strings, the length of string B (M), and the string B itself.\\n- Generating Substrings: Generate all possible substrings of string B.\\n- Ensuring Uniqueness: Remove duplicate substrings. The prompt states that substrings with the same permutation of characters are considered the same. However, based on the test cases, it appears that the substrings are considered same only when they are exactly same.\\n- Matching with List: Check each unique substring of B to see if it exists in the provided list of strings and count how many exist.\\n- Optimization Considerations: Since the constraints are quite low (N and M <= 100), the most straightforward solution of generating all substrings should be enough.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the constraints on the size of N and the lengths of the strings?\",\n    \"How can I efficiently generate all the substrings of string B?\",\n    \"How do I ensure that I only count unique substrings of B?\",\n    \"How should I handle the case where the substrings have same characters but are in different order?\",\n    \"How do I efficiently search for the substrings of B in the provided string list?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"N is between 1 and 100. The length of each string in the list is less than or equal to 100, and the length of string B is between 2 and 100.\",\n    \"I can use nested loops. The outer loop iterates through the starting indices, and the inner loop iterates through the ending indices to create substrings.\",\n    \"I can use a set or dictionary to store the substrings as I generate them, to automatically remove duplicates.\",\n    \"Based on the prompt, same permutation of characters is considered same, but based on the test cases, the substrings are considered same only when they are exactly same.\",\n    \"Since the size of the string list is relatively small (up to 100), I can iterate through each substring of B and check if it exists in the list using the 'in' operator or a similar string comparison method.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
