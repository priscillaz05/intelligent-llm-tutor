He introduced a cartesian coordinate system so that the point (0, 0) corresponds to the lower-left corner of the bar, and the point (W, H) corresponds to the upper-right corner. Bob decided to split the bar into pieces by breaking it. Each break is a segment parallel to one of the coordinate axes, which connects the edges of the bar. More formally, each break goes along the line x = xc or y = yc, where xc and yc are integers. It should divide one part of the bar into two non-empty parts. After Bob breaks some part into two parts, he breaks the resulting parts separately and independently from each other. Also he doesn't move the parts of the bar. Bob made n breaks and wrote them down in his notebook in arbitrary order. At the end he got n + 1 parts. Now he wants to calculate their areas. Bob is lazy, so he asks you to do this task.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line contains 3 integers W, H and n (1 \u2264 W, H, n \u2264 100) \u2014 width of the bar, height of the bar and amount of breaks. Each of the following n lines contains four integers xi, 1, yi, 1, xi, 2, yi, 2 \u2014 coordinates of the endpoints of the i-th break (0 \u2264 xi, 1 \u2264 xi, 2 \u2264 W, 0 \u2264 yi, 1 \u2264 yi, 2 \u2264 H, or xi, 1 = xi, 2, or yi, 1 = yi, 2). Breaks are given in arbitrary order.\\n\\nIt is guaranteed that the set of breaks is correct, i.e. there is some order of the given breaks that each next break divides exactly one part of the bar into two non-empty parts.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nOutput n + 1 numbers \u2014 areas of the resulting parts in the increasing order.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nInput\\n\\n2 2 2\\n1 0 1 2\\n0 1 1 1\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n1 1 2 \\n\\nInput\\n\\n2 2 3\\n1 0 1 2\\n0 1 1 1\\n1 1 2 1\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n1 1 1 1 \\n\\nInput\\n\\n2 4 2\\n0 1 2 1\\n0 3 2 3\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n2 2 4\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"(w, h, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))\\na = [[0 for i in range(2 * w - 1)] for j in range(2 * h - 1)]\\nfor i in range(1, 2 * h - 1, 2):\\n\\tfor j in range(1, 2 * w - 1, 2):\\n\\t\\ta[i][j] = ' '\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\t(x1, y1, x2, y2) = list(map(int, input().split()))\\n\\tif x1 == x2:\\n\\t\\tif x1 != 0 and x1 != w:\\n\\t\\t\\tfor j in range(min(y1, y2), max(y1, y2)):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta[2 * h - 2 - 2 * j][2 * x1 - 1] = ' '\\n\\telif y1 != 0 and y1 != h:\\n\\t\\tfor j in range(min(x1, x2), max(x1, x2)):\\n\\t\\t\\ta[2 * h - 1 - 2 * y1][2 * j] = ' '\\nb = []\\nc = 1\\nfor i in range(0, 2 * h - 1, 2):\\n\\tfor j in range(0, 2 * w - 1, 2):\\n\\t\\tif a[i][j] == 0:\\n\\t\\t\\td = i\\n\\t\\t\\te = j\\n\\t\\t\\twhile d < 2 * h - 1 and a[d][e] == 0 and (a[d - 1][e] != ' ') or d == i:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\td += 2\\n\\t\\t\\td -= 2\\n\\t\\t\\twhile e < 2 * w - 1 and a[d][e] == 0 and (a[d][e - 1] != ' ') or e == j:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\te += 2\\n\\t\\t\\te -= 2\\n\\t\\t\\tb.append(((e - j) // 2 + 1) * ((d - i) // 2 + 1))\\n\\t\\t\\tfor k in range(i, d + 1, 2):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor l in range(j, e + 1, 2):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ta[k][l] = c\\n\\t\\t\\tc += 1\\nb += [0] * (n + 1 - len(b))\\nprint(*sorted(b))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem describes dividing a chocolate bar with horizontal and vertical breaks and calculating the areas of the resulting pieces.\\n- Representing the Chocolate Bar and Breaks: The core idea is to represent the chocolate bar and the breaks in a way that allows us to easily determine the connected components and calculate their areas.\\n- Identifying Connected Components: Determine which parts of the bar are still connected after the breaks, forming individual pieces.\\n- Calculating Areas: Compute the area of each connected component, which represents the area of each piece of the chocolate bar.\\n- Handling Input and Output: Parse the input to extract the dimensions of the bar and the break coordinates.
