To process columns, transpose the hive by converting columns into rows. The standard 'zip(*hive)' operation can perform this transposition efficiently.\",\n    \"I can use 'zip(*hive)' to transpose the matrix to transform the columns into rows.  I can then iterate over rows (original and transposed) and use the count() string method to get the count.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
