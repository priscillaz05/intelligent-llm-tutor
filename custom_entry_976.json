"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"Little Vaishnavi is bored during the vacation which is going on. Being the only little girl in the neighbourhood she did not have any one else to play with. Her parents are so strict that they will not let her out of the house even to see what the kids from the other houses are playing.\\n\\nSo she decided to make a game of her own. As of now there is construction going on in her house there were lots of plywood sheets of rectangular size in her house. Now she is making a small game. She will take 5 such plywood pieces, out of which she will be taking one which is damaged! It can be placed anywhere among the 5 pieces.Now she will start jumping on the plywood and will be counting the number of jumps. \\n\\nSay she will start from 1 and then she will go to plywood 2, then 3,then 4 and then 5th piece. After reaching the 5th plywood she will come back to 4th plywood, then to 3rd, than to 2nd and then to 1st. After that she will again jump to 2nd and then 3rd and so on! But as we know out of the 5 plywood pieces one will be defective. It will not support more than K jumps. After the Kth jump on the defective piece it will break.\\n\\nGiven the position of the defective plywood and the value of K we have to tell our cute Vaishnavi upto what will be the maximum of the count go up to?\\n\\nInput:\\n\\nThe first line contains T, the number of test cases.\\nFollowed by T lines each contain two numbers M and K\\n\\n2 integers M and K where M is the position of the defective piece among the 5 pieces and K is the maximum jumps that can be made on the defective piece.\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\nFor every Test case Print the maximum count till vaishnavi can go up to.\\n\\nSeparate the answers for each test case by an empty line.\\n\\nConstraints :\\n\\n   1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\\n   1 \u2264 M \u2264 5\\n   0 \u2264 K \u2264 10^5\\n\\nProblem Setter : Bipin Baburaj\\n\\nProblem Tester : Darshak Mehta\\n\\nSAMPLE INPUT\\n2\\n2 3\\n1 0\\n\\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\\n15\\n0\\n\\nExplanation\\n\\nTestCase#1:\\nFirst Vaishnavi will jump from 1st ->2nd ->3rd ->4th->5th->4th->3rd->2nd->1st->2nd-> 3rd->4th->5th->4th->3rd.\\nIf she moves to 2 then it will break so count is 15\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"test = eval(input())\\nfor _ in range(test):\\n\\tm, k = list(map(int, input().split(\\\" \\\")))\\n\\tif m == 1:\\n\\t\\tprint(8*k)\\n\\telif m == 2:\\n\\t\\tif k%2 == 0:\\n\\t\\t\\tprint(8*(k/2) + 1)\\n\\t\\telse :\\n\\t\\t\\tprint(8*(k/2 + 1) -1)\\n\\telif m == 3:\\n\\t\\tprint(2 + 4*k)\\n\\telif m == 4:\\n\\t\\tif k%2 == 0:\\n\\t\\t\\tprint(4*(k+1) -1)\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tprint(4*k +1)\\n\\telif m == 5:\\n\\t\\tprint(4 + 8*k)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Jumping Pattern: Analyze how Vaishnavi moves between plywood pieces: 1->2->3->4->5->4->3->2->1->2->...  Notice the repetitive cycle and how each piece is visited within that cycle.\\n- Determining Jump Counts for Each Position: Figure out the number of jumps it takes to reach each plywood piece in a cycle.  Calculate jumps to each piece within the basic cycle and then extrapolate for K jumps on the defective piece.\\n- Identifying the Breaking Point: Find at what jump count the defective plywood will break based on its position (M) and the maximum allowable jumps (K) on it.\\n- Calculating the Maximum Count: Calculate the total number of jumps until the defective plywood breaks, based on when that plywood is reached in the jumping sequence.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does the jumping pattern repeat, and what is the sequence of jumps in a full cycle?\",\n    \"For each plywood piece, how many jumps does it take to reach it for the first, second, third, etc. time(s)?\",\n    \"How can you determine at which total jump count the defective plywood will break, given its position and maximum allowable jumps?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the overall maximum jump count if the defective plywood breaks at a specific jump number?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases to consider, such as when K=0, or M=1, and how do those affect the calculation?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The jumping pattern is: 1->2->3->4->5->4->3->2->1->2->3->4->5... The cycle isn't immediately obvious; it's easier to enumerate jumps until a pattern emerges relating jump count to plywood position.\",\n    \"The number of jumps to reach each plywood depends on the position. Example: to reach position 2 for the first time is 1 jump, the second time is 8 jumps, and so on.\",\n    \"To find when the defective plywood breaks, find the sequence of jumps when the plywood is stepped on and find the Kth occurance.\",\n    \"To determine the maximum count, calculate total number of jumps until just before breaking. Based on the jumping pattern and where the board breaks. \",\n    \"Edge cases include: If K = 0, then the defective plywood breaks immediately, so we may need special handling. If M = 1 and K=0, print 0\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
