The linked list is sorted, and no two nodes have the same data. The solution needs to be efficient, aiming for O(N^2) time complexity and O(N) space complexity.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Recognize that the linked list is sorted, but the triplets must be distinct. Consider potential issues with repeated values that might lead to duplicate triplets. Optimize the search for triplets efficiently.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Explore approaches such as using a hash table to store the values of nodes and searching for complementary pairs for each node. Use a nested loop approach combined with a hash table lookup.\\n- Implementing the Triplet Search: Iterate through the linked list using nested loops and use a hash table to check if a third value exists that would complete the triplet summing to X. Return the total count of distinct triplets found.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean to find distinct triplets that sum to a specific value X in a linked list, and why is distinctness important?\",\n    \"If the list is sorted, can you explain how this property affects the approach for finding triplets?\",\n    \"Why is a hash table helpful in finding complementary pairs, and what advantages does it offer over other approaches?\",\n    \"How do you address the space complexity of using a hash table, and what are the space implications in relation to the size of the linked list?\",\n    \"What steps can you take to avoid counting duplicate triplets, and how does that impact the algorithm's efficiency?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Finding distinct triplets means identifying three unique nodes in the linked list whose values add up to the target value X. Distinctness is important because the problem specifies counting only unique combinations of three nodes, avoiding duplicates.\",\n    \"Since the list is sorted, it's tempting to apply a similar approach as the two-pointer technique used in arrays. Although, implementing the two-pointer technique directly on linked lists might not be efficient due to the lack of random access. Hash table becomes a good approach.\",\n    \"A hash table is helpful because it provides fast lookups, allowing you to efficiently check if the third value needed to complete the triplet (i.e., X - (node1.val + node2.val)) exists. Hash table provides an average-case time complexity of O(1) for lookups, speeding up the process.\",\n    \"Using a hash table typically requires O(N) space to store the values of the nodes in the list. This meets the expected auxiliary space requirement. The trade-off is using more space to achieve better time complexity for finding triplets.\",\n    \"To avoid counting duplicate triplets, store only the node values in the hashmap and make sure you increment the counter of distinct triplets whenever you find a new triplet. No additional steps for avoiding duplicate triplets are necessary.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
