If no set bit exists, the function should return 0.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: The algorithm can be implemented by repeatedly checking the least significant bit (LSB) of the number. If the LSB is a set bit, its position is returned. If not, the number is right-shifted to examine the next bit, and a counter keeps track of the position.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: When N is 0, there are no set bits, so the function should return 0.\\n- Optimizing for Efficiency: The time complexity should be O(log N) as the number of iterations depends on the number of bits in N.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean to find the 'first set bit' from the right side, and how does it relate to the binary representation of the number?\",\n    \"If the input integer is 0, what should the function return, and why?\",\n    \"What algorithm or method can you use to examine each bit from right to left without converting the integer to a string?\",\n    \"How do you keep track of the position of the bit being examined as you iterate through the binary representation of the number?\",\n    \"How can you optimize the code to achieve an O(log N) time complexity, and is it possible to further improve the time complexity?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Finding the first set bit from the right side means identifying the position of the least significant bit that is equal to 1 in the binary representation of the given number. The position is counted from the right, starting from 1.\",\n    \"If the input integer is 0, the function should return 0 because the binary representation of 0 contains no set bits.\",\n    \"We can repeatedly check the least significant bit using the modulo operator (%) and then right-shift the number by dividing by 2 (or using bitwise right shift) to examine the next bit. This approach avoids string conversion.\",\n    \"We can maintain a counter that increments in each iteration, representing the current bit position. The counter starts from 1 and increments each time we check a bit.\",\n    \"The time complexity is already O(log N) because, in each iteration, the number of bits to be checked is halved due to the right-shift operation.  It's not possible to improve the time complexity further using basic arithmetic operations.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
