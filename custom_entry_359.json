"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"Kontti language is a finnish word play game.\\n\\nYou add `-kontti` to the end of each word and then swap their characters until and including the first vowel (\\\"aeiouy\\\"); \\n\\nFor example the word `tame` becomes `kome-tantti`; `fruity` becomes `koity-fruntti` and so on.\\n\\nIf no vowel is present, the word stays the same.\\n\\nWrite a string method that turns a sentence into kontti language!\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import re\\n\\ndef kontti(s):\\n\\treturn ' '.join([re.sub('([^aeiouy]*[aeiouy])(.*)', 'ko\\\\\\\\2-\\\\1ntti', w, flags=re.I) for w in s.split()])\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: Recognize that the goal is to convert a given sentence into 'Kontti' language, following specific rules. Identify the key steps: appending '-kontti', finding the first vowel, and swapping the parts of the word.\\n- Identifying Edge Cases: Consider words with no vowels and how they should be handled (no change). Consider cases with only vowels.\\n- Planning an Algorithm: Consider splitting the input sentence into words. For each word, identify and handle the case if there are no vowels. If there are vowels, implement the swap logic, then add '-kontti'. Rejoin into a sentence.\\n- Implementing Kontti Conversion: Handle the logic to identify the first vowel. Perform the swap of the first section with the remaining section. Remember to rejoin the modified words into a sentence.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the explicit rules for transforming a word into Kontti language?\",\n    \"How should words without any vowels be handled by the transformation?\",\n    \"What algorithmic strategy can be used for converting each word effectively?\",\n    \"How would you manage array indexing when dealing with word manipulation?\",\n    \"What Python libraries can be useful for word manipulation or finding the first vowel?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The rules are: append '-kontti', find the first vowel (a, e, i, o, u, y), swap the characters up to and including the first vowel with the rest of the word, and concatenate 'ko' with remaining section followed by '-'. Then the first vowel plus characters up to it, plus 'ntti'.\",\n    \"Words without vowels should remain unchanged, according to the problem description.\",\n    \"Split the sentence into words, iterate through each word, check for vowels, perform swapping (if vowels are present), then join the transformed words back into a sentence.\",\n    \"When swapping sections of a word, ensure correct substring or slice boundaries to prevent index out-of-bounds errors.\",\n    \"The 're' (regular expression) library is very helpful for finding the position of the first vowel.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
