If such n does not exist, return -1.\\n- Identifying Key Properties: Recognize that n XOR (n+1) results in a number where all bits to the right of the least significant set bit of n are set to 1, and the least significant set bit is cleared. Thus, k must be of the form 2^x - 1 for some x.  In other words, k must be an odd number. Also n will be k/2 if k is of the form 2^x - 1.\n- Algorithmic Strategy Selection: Consider checking if k is a power of 2 minus 1.  If it is, the corresponding n can be computed. If not, no such n exists and -1 should be returned.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Consider special cases like k = 1, where n = 2.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the bitwise XOR operation, and how does it behave when applied to two consecutive integers (n and n+1)?\",\n    \"Under what condition(s) does a positive integer k have a corresponding n such that n XOR (n+1) equals k?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently check if a number k is of the form 2^x - 1?\",\n    \"What are the special cases or edge cases that the solution needs to handle?\",\n    \"Given that the time complexity must be O(1), what bitwise operations can be used to validate if such an 'n' can exist and compute it?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The XOR operation compares corresponding bits of two integers.
