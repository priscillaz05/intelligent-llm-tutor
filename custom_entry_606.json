An entire tape can be represented as a single row of N cells. Each cell has its Stickiness factor, which stands for its ability to stick to an object. We say that a tape is a good quality product, if and only if the total sum of Stickiness factors of grid cells in any of its subarray of size K is at least D.\\n\\nTo make a quality product, consider an augment operation in which you can choose any subarray of size at most K  and a real number (say R), and multiply Stickiness factor of all its cells by R. For each augment operation, the subarray and the value of R can be chosen arbitrarily. However, the size of chosen subarray for augmentation can be at most K, as mentioned before. \\n\\nYour task is to calculate the minimum number of augment operations needed to be performed in order to transform the given tape to a good quality product.\\n\\nINPUT\\n\\nThe first line contains three space separated integers N, K and D, as described above. The next line contains N space separated integers, i^th of which (denoted by Ai) denotes the Stickiness factor of i^th cell.\\n\\nOUTPUT\\n\\nOutput in single line, an integer, which denotes the minimum number of augment operations needed to be performed in order to transform the tape to a good quality product. In case, if it is impossible to achieve, print -1 instead.\\n\\nCONSTRAINTS\\n\\n1 \u2264 N, D \u2264 10^5\\n1 \u2264 K \u2264 N\\n0 \u2264 Ai \u2264 10^5\\n\\nSAMPLE INPUT\\n3 2 4\\n1 1 1 \\n\\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\\n1\\n\\nExplanation\\n\\nWe can multiply the second element by 3. Now the tape becomes: 1 3 1. \\n\\nAny subarray of size 2 has now sum = 4, which satisfies the required condition. We used 1 augment operation, hence the answer is 1.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"from sys import stdin\\n\\ndef main():\\n\\tnextint = iter(map(int, stdin.read().split())).__next__\\n\\tn, k, d = nextint(), nextint(), nextint()\\n\\tarr = [nextint() for _ in range(n)]\\n\\tcsum = sum(arr[:k - 1])\\n\\tfor x in range(k - 1, n):\\n\\t\\tcsum += arr[x]\\n\\t\\tif csum == 0:\\n\\t\\t\\tprint(-1)\\n\\t\\t\\treturn\\n\\t\\tcsum -= arr[x - (k - 1)]\\n\\tcount, lastnz, pick = 0, -1, [0]*n\\n\\tcsum = 0\\n\\tx = 0\\n\\twhile x < n:\\n\\t\\tif arr[x]:\\n\\t\\t\\tlastnz = x\\n\\t\\tcsum += arr[x]\\n\\t\\tpick[x] = 1\\n\\t\\tif x < k - 1:\\n\\t\\t\\tx += 1\\n\\t\\t\\tcontinue\\n\\t\\tif pick[x - k]:\\n\\t\\t\\tcsum -= arr[x - k]\\n\\t\\tif csum < d:\\n\\t\\t\\tcount += 1\\n\\t\\t\\tcsum = 0\\n\\t\\t\\tpick[x] = 0\\n\\t\\t\\tx = lastnz + 2*k - 1\\n\\t\\t\\tfor y in range(lastnz + k, min(lastnz + 2*k - 1, n)):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif arr[y]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlastnz = y\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpick[y] = 1\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcsum += arr[y]\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tx += 1\\n\\tprint(count)\\n\\nmain()\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires finding the minimum number of augment operations to make every subarray of size K have a sum of stickiness factors at least D. An augment operation multiplies the stickiness factor of elements in a subarray of at most size K by a real number R.\\n- Identifying Edge Cases: An edge case to consider is when all the numbers in a window of size K are 0, in this case it will be impossible to achieve a sum of at least D, and the function should return -1.\\n- Selecting a Strategy: We can use a greedy approach to solve this problem. We can iterate through the array and calculate the sum of the current window of size K. If the sum is less than D, we can augment the subarray by multiplying the element that was most recently added with a value that makes the sum to be at least D. This way we can determine how many augment operations are needed.\\n- Implementation Details: Need to ensure that the window slides correctly. Also, if the current window sum is less than D, then the algorithm should try to augment from the latest non zero element to its neighboring elements. Because augment operation can select at most K elements. Augmenting a zero element wouldn't increase the sum, therefore picking the most recent non-zero element is the best possible choice.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you determine the number of augment operations needed to achieve the desired tape quality?\",\n    \"What edge cases need to be considered, and how would you handle them?\",\n    \"Can you explain the greedy approach and why it works in this context?\",\n    \"If the elements within the subarray are all zero, what is the approach? \",\n    \"How should we augment in a subarray containing zero values?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The number of augment operations is determined by iterating through the tape and checking the sum of each subarray of size K. If a subarray's sum is less than D, an augment operation is performed to bring the sum up to at least D, and the operation count is incremented.\",\n    \"One edge case is when all the stickiness factors in a subarray of size K are 0, which makes it impossible to reach a sum of at least D. Another edge case is when N < K, in which case, there is only one subarray whose sum needs to be considered. Also, an empty input should be considered.\",\n    \"The greedy approach involves iterating through the array and augmenting the subarray as soon as its sum falls below D. It works because augmenting earlier subarrays allows later subarrays (which may overlap) to potentially meet the D requirement without requiring additional augment operations.\",\n    \"If elements within a subarray are all zero, it will be impossible to satisfy the condition that the sum of the subarray of length K must be at least D. In that case, you should return -1.\",\n    \"In a subarray containing zero values, augmenting those specific zero-valued cells will not contribute to increasing the subarray's sum. Therefore, you should focus on augmenting the non-zero elements within that subarray, prioritizing augmenting the most recent non zero cells to improve the stickiness factor sum.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
