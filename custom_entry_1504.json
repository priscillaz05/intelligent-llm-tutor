Here sign s_{i} represents the i-th digit of string s, similarly, w_{j} represents the j-th digit of string w.\\n\\nA string's template is a string that consists of digits and question marks (\\\"?\\\").\\n\\nYaroslav has two string templates, each of them has length n. Yaroslav wants to count the number of ways to replace all question marks by some integers in both templates, so as to make the resulting strings incomparable.

The question marks can be replaced by any digit from 0 to 9. The final answer needs to be modulo 1000000007.\\n- Breaking Down the Problem: The total number of possible strings is 10^(number of question marks). The number of comparable strings needs to be subtracted from the total number of possible strings. Two strings are comparable if s1 >= s2 or s1 <= s2. The number of s1 >= s2 strings needs to be calculated. Similarly, the number of s1 <= s2 strings needs to be calculated. The number of s1 == s2 strings needs to be added back since it was subtracted twice.\\n- Devise an Algorithm: Iterate through all the possible ways to fill the question marks and compare the resulting strings. For larger input size, dynamic programming approach needs to be used for counting number of comparable strings by maintaining counts of s1 > s2, s1 < s2, and s1 == s2.\\n- Optimizations: Use modulo arithmetic to prevent overflow.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does the condition for non-comparability impact the algorithm used to solve the problem?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases to consider, such as when there are no question marks or when all characters are question marks?\",\n    \"How does the modulo operation impact the final answer, and why is it needed?\",\n    \"Can you explain the logic behind calculating number of comparable strings and how it relates to number of non-comparable strings\",\n    \"For larger inputs, is there a more optimized approach than brute-force string comparison?\",\n    \"What is the role of reduce function and lambda expression used in the ground truth solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The non-comparability condition requires checking for the existence of indices i and j where s[i] > w[i] and s[j] < w[j]. This necessitates evaluating the entire strings to determine comparability, thereby affecting the choice and complexity of the algorithm.\",\n    \"If there are no question marks, the strings are either comparable or non-comparable, leading to an answer of 0 or 1, respectively. If all characters are question marks, the number of combinations becomes a dominant factor, and we need to calculate all possible combinations that produce incomparable strings.\",\n    \"The modulo operation ensures that the result remains within the specified range (0 to 1000000006), preventing integer overflow issues. It is required because the number of possible combinations can be very large.\",\n    \"The number of comparable strings can be calculated by counting all instances where s1 >= s2 or s1 <= s2. Subtracted them from total possible combination. Adding back the number of cases where s1 equals s2 because those cases have been subracted twice. The total number of non-comparable strings is derived by subtracting comparable strings from the total number of possible strings.\",\n    \"For larger inputs, a dynamic programming approach can be more efficient. We can maintain counts of s1 > s2, s1 < s2, and s1 == s2 as we fill in the question marks, avoiding redundant calculations.\",\n    \"The reduce function with a lambda expression provides a concise way to perform cumulative calculations over a sequence of items, typically used to efficiently compute aggregations like products or logical AND/OR operations.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
