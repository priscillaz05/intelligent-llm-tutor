A local maximum at index i means p[i-1] < p[i] > p[i+1], and a local minimum at index i means p[i-1] > p[i] < p[i+1]. If no such permutation exists, output -1.\\n- Identifying Constraints: The integers n, a, and b are bounded as $2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^5$ and $0 \\\\leq a,b \\\\leq n$. The solution must be efficient enough to handle up to $10^4$ test cases, with the sum of n over all cases not exceeding $10^5$.\\n- Edge Cases and Invalid Conditions: If $abs(a - b) > 1$ or $a + b > n - 2$, then there will be no such permutation. Return -1.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: Try to construct the permutation directly when it's possible. A valid permutation can be generated when $|a - b| <= 1$ and $a + b <= n - 2$. Start with a simple permutation and swap elements to create the required local maximums and minimums. Specifically, construct an ascending permutation from 1 to n. Swap adjacent elements to introduce local maxima and minima.\\n- Implementation Details: Construct the initial permutation as a list of numbers from 1 to n. Swap elements at indexes i and i+1 for the desired number of maxima and minima.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the necessary conditions on $n$, $a$, and $b$ for a valid permutation to exist?\",\n    \"If a valid permutation exists, how can a basic permutation be modified to satisfy the local maximum and minimum requirements?\",\n    \"What is the most efficient way to generate the initial permutation from 1 to n, and how do you handle index management when swapping elements?\",\n    \"How do you account for the condition $a==b$ when constructing a valid permutation?\",\n    \"How should the code respond when it's impossible to generate such a permutation based on $n$, $a$, and $b$?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"For a valid permutation to exist, we need $|a-b| <= 1$ and $a+b <= n-2$.
