The laughter always alternates between male and female.\\n- Identifying the Pattern: Understand that each distinct sequence of 'ha' or 'Ha' represents a kookaburra.  Overlapping 'ha' and 'Ha' sequences need to be considered as part of a single kookaburra laugh.\\n- Selecting a Strategy: Consider using regular expressions to find all occurrences of either 'ha' repeated one or more times or 'Ha' repeated one or more times. Count the number of distinct, non-overlapping matches.\\n- Implementation: Implement the regular expression to search for sequences of 'ha' and 'Ha'. Return the count of these sequences.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the distinct laughter patterns for male and female kookaburras, and how do they differ?\",\n    \"How can you use regular expressions to find all occurrences of these laughter patterns in a string?\",\n    \"How would you ensure that overlapping sequences of 'ha' and 'Ha' are not counted as separate kookaburras?\",\n    \"If the input string contains mixed-case laughs like 'HaHaHa hahaha Ha', how would you handle the case sensitivity to count the kookaburras correctly?\",\n    \"What edge cases should you consider, such as an empty input string, and how would you handle them?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Male kookaburras laugh with 'HaHaHa...' (uppercase 'Ha' repeated), and female kookaburras laugh with 'hahaha...' (lowercase 'ha' repeated).\",\n    \"Regular expressions can be used with patterns like '(ha)+' to find repeating lowercase 'ha' sequences and '(Ha)+' for repeating uppercase 'Ha' sequences.\",\n    \"The regular expression engine handles overlapping sequences by default, finding the next non-overlapping match after each match is identified.\",\n    \"The regular expression pattern should include both '(ha)+' and '(Ha)+' to match both uppercase and lowercase sequences regardless of their order in the input string.\",\n    \"If the input string is empty, the regular expression will not find any matches, and the function should return 0, indicating no kookaburras.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
