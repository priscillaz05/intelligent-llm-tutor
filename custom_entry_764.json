The result must be returned modulo 1,000,000,007.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints:  The number of strings N in S can be up to 100,000. String lengths can be up to 100,000, with the total length of strings in S being at most 200,000. The length of the target string `t` is also up to 100,000. The primary constraint is to achieve an efficient solution due to potentially large input sizes.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: A dynamic programming approach seems suitable to count the number of ways to separate the string. To efficiently check if a substring is in the set `S`, hashing can be used. Rolling hash would be efficient.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Overlapping subproblems in the dynamic programming approach need to be carefully managed. Handling large numbers using modulo arithmetic is also crucial to prevent overflow.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can dynamic programming be used to solve this problem, and what should the base case and recursive relation be?\",\n    \"How can hashing be used to efficiently check if a substring of 't' exists in the set 'S'?\",\n    \"Considering the large input sizes, what time complexity should we aim for, and how can we optimize the solution to achieve this?\",\n    \"How can we handle the modulo operation to ensure the result remains within the required range (0 to 1,000,000,006)?\",\n    \"What data structures are best suited for storing the set 'S' to enable efficient lookup during the dynamic programming stage?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Dynamic programming can be used by defining dp[i] as the number of ways to separate the first 'i' characters of 't'. The base case would be dp[0] = 1 (empty string has one way to be separated). The recursive relation would be dp[i] = sum(dp[i-len(s)]) for all s in S such that t[i-len(s):i] == s.\",\n    \"Hashing can be used to map each string in 'S' to a unique integer value. A rolling hash can compute the hash of each substring of 't' in O(1) time, allowing efficient comparison with the hashes of strings in 'S'.\",\n    \"Given the input sizes, an O(n*m) or O(n log m) solution, where n is the length of 't' and m is the average length of strings in S, would be desirable. Optimizations can include using rolling hash for constant-time substring comparisons and appropriate data structures for set lookups.\",\n    \"The modulo operation (result % 1,000,000,007) should be applied after each arithmetic operation (addition, multiplication, etc.) to prevent integer overflow while ensuring the result is always within the valid range.\",\n    \"A hash set (or a dictionary using hashing) is well-suited for storing the set 'S' to allow O(1) average-time complexity lookups.
