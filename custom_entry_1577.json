Realize that the goal is to maximize the number of '01' substrings.\\n- Identifying Key Insights: Notice that the order of 0s and 1s within the even and odd indexed positions can be rearranged freely. This simplifies the problem to counting the number of 0s and 1s in even and odd positions.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Count the number of 0s and 1s in the even and odd positions. Calculate the maximum number of '01' substrings that can be formed by optimally arranging these counts.\\n- Implementation Details: Calculate how many 0s from odd positions can be paired with 1s from even positions.

This limits the arrangements that are reachable from the initial string. We can freely rearrange the characters within each parity group, but cannot mix characters between parity groups.\",\n    \"We can count the number of 0s and 1s at even and odd indices separately. Since the order within the parity groups can be changed, we can pair as many 0s from odd positions with 1s from even positions as possible to form '01' substrings.\",\n    \"First, find the minimum between the count of 0s at odd indices and the count of 1s at even indices; this is the number of guaranteed '01' substrings. Then, check if the string has any remaining places for '01' patterns to be formed.\",\n    \"The length determines how many possible pairs can exist in the string. When calculating additional 01 occurrences beyond those formed by pairing 0s and 1s from different parities, the total length will constrain the maximum possible number. An odd length might influence calculations when trying to form the maximal number of 01 pairs after the initial optimal pairing.\",\n    \"Consider cases with all 0s or all 1s, or when either even or odd indices contain only one type of digit. Ensure proper handling for strings of length 1 or 2. Also, think about the case where the number of 0s and 1s are equal or have a large difference. For example, an all '0' string should result in 0.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
