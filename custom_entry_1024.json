The task is to find the maximum count of consecutive substrings str can be divided into such that all the substrings are balanced i.e. they have an equal number of 0s and 1s.

The goal is to find the maximum number of such balanced substrings.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Consider the case when it's not possible to split the string into balanced substrings, in which case we should return -1. This happens when the total number of 0s and 1s in the string are not equal.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: The key to solving this problem efficiently is to keep track of the balance of 0s and 1s as we iterate through the string. We can use a counter to track the difference between the number of 0s and 1s seen so far. When the counter becomes 0, it means we have found a balanced substring.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Handle the edge case where the string cannot be split into balanced substrings. Initialize a balance variable to 0, then check at the end if the balance is not 0, return -1. Otherwise, return the substring count.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for a substring to be 'balanced' in the context of this problem?\",\n    \"What should be returned if it is impossible to split the input string into balanced substrings?\",\n    \"How can we efficiently track the balance of 0s and 1s as we iterate through the input string?\",\n    \"What is the significance of the balance counter being 0 at any point during iteration?\",\n    \"What is the expected time complexity of this algorithm, and why?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A substring is considered 'balanced' if it contains an equal number of 0s and 1s.\",\n    \"If it is impossible to split the input string into balanced substrings, the function should return -1.\",\n    \"We can efficiently track the balance by initializing a counter to 0 and incrementing it for each '0' and decrementing it for each '1'.\",\n    \"When the balance counter is 0, it indicates that the substring from the beginning (or the last balanced substring) to the current index is balanced, meaning we can split the string here.\",\n    \"The expected time complexity is O(N), where N is the length of the string, as we iterate through the string once.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
