The indices must satisfy $1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq N$.\\n- Identifying Constraints: Consider the given constraints: the array size `N` can be up to $10^5$, the number of queries `Q` can be up to 500, the array elements $a_i$ can be up to $10^9$, and the query values $x_i$ can be up to $10^{14}$.\\n- Choosing an Algorithmic Approach: Since we need to compute subarray sums and the array size can be large, precomputing prefix sums can be beneficial for efficient computation of subarray sums in O(1) time. For each query, iterate through all possible subarrays and check if their sum is less than or equal to `x`. A sliding window approach can be used for each query to improve performance.\\n- Optimization Considerations: The constraints suggest an O(N*Q) solution might be acceptable, but optimizing the subarray sum calculation using prefix sums is crucial. The $10^{14}$ constraint on x_i means we may need to consider large integers and use appropriate data types.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the most efficient way to compute the sum of a subarray given the constraints on N and the range of possible values for each element a_i?\",\n    \"How can you iterate through all possible subarrays of an array, and what is the time complexity of this approach?\",\n    \"How can you optimize the process of counting the number of subarrays that satisfy the given sum condition for each query?\",\n    \"What data types should you use to avoid overflow errors when calculating the sum of subarrays, given that the sum can reach up to $10^{14}$?\",\n    \"Are there any edge cases to consider, such as when the array is empty or when all elements are negative and the target sum is positive?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Precomputing prefix sums allows you to compute the sum of any subarray in O(1) time using the formula sum[r] - sum[l-1], where sum[i] is the sum of the first i elements of the array.\",\n    \"You can iterate through all possible subarrays using nested loops, where the outer loop iterates through the starting indices `l` and the inner loop iterates through the ending indices `r` from `l` to `N`. This approach has a time complexity of O(N^2).\",\n    \"A sliding window technique, combined with prefix sums, can optimize the process. Also, the outer loop through queries can also be optimized by sorting the array.\",\n    \"You should use 64-bit integers (long long in C++, long in Java or Python) to store the prefix sums and subarray sums to avoid overflow errors, since these sums can reach up to $N * max(a_i) = 10^5 * 10^9 = 10^{14}$.\",\n    \"If the array is empty, the number of combinations is 0. If all elements are negative and the target sum is positive, you need to consider cases where even small subarrays have sums less than or equal to the target sum.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
