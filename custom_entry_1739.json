We need to handle potential large numbers by taking the modulo.\\n- Choosing an Algorithmic Strategy: Dynamic programming seems appropriate. We can build a DP table where dp[i] stores the number of ways to form the sum 'i' using the Xth powers of unique natural numbers.\\n- Designing the DP Table and Transitions: dp[0] = 1 (base case: one way to form a sum of 0, which is by using no numbers). For each number p (which is i^x) less than or equal to n, we update dp[i] by adding dp[i - p] to it, where dp[i - p] represents the number of ways to form the sum i-p. Thus dp[i] will become the number of ways to create sum i, either without or with p.\\n- Implementation Details: Pre-calculate the powers i^x that are less than or equal to n.  Iterate through the powers in the outer loop and the DP table in reverse order in the inner loop to avoid using the same power multiple times.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean to express n as the sum of the Xth power of unique natural numbers?\",\n    \"How do the constraints on n and x influence the choice of algorithm and data structures?\",\n    \"Why is dynamic programming suitable for solving this counting problem?\",\n    \"How is the DP table structured, and what does dp[i] represent?\",\n    \"What is the base case for the DP, and how does it initialize the DP table?\",\n    \"How are the DP transitions defined, and how do they ensure we use unique natural numbers?\",\n    \"How is the modulo operation used to prevent integer overflow?\",\n    \"What powers need to be precalculated?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"It means finding combinations of distinct natural numbers (1, 2, 3, ...) such that the sum of each number raised to the power of x equals n.\",\n    \"The constraints limit the size of the DP table (n <= 1000), allowing the use of O(n) space. Also, x <= 5, which limits the number of powers we need to pre-calculate.\",\n    \"Dynamic programming is suitable because it allows us to build up solutions for smaller sums incrementally and reuse those solutions to solve larger sums. It avoids redundant calculations.\",\n    \"The DP table is an array where dp[i] stores the number of ways to obtain the sum i using the Xth powers of unique natural numbers.\",\n    \"The base case is dp[0] = 1, which means there is one way to form a sum of 0 by using no numbers.\",\n    \"The DP transitions update dp[i] by adding dp[i - p], where p is the current Xth power of a natural number. The iteration order ensures that each power is used only once, maintaining uniqueness.
