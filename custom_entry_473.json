Then, use conditional statements (if-elif-else) to determine the appropriate letter grade based on the calculated average.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: The problem statement specifies that input values are between 0 and 100, so no explicit handling of out-of-range values is required.\\n- Implementation Details: Use the correct comparison operators (<=, <) to match the specified grade ranges.
