There are $k$ treasures on the island, the $i$-th of them is located at the position $(r_i, c_i)$.\\n\\nInitially you stand at the lower left corner of the island, at the position $(1, 1)$. If at any moment you are at the cell with a treasure, you can pick it up without any extra time. In one move you can move up (from $(r, c)$ to $(r+1, c)$), left (from $(r, c)$ to $(r, c-1)$), or right (from position $(r, c)$ to $(r, c+1)$). Because of the traps, you can't move down.\\n\\nHowever, moving up is also risky. You can move up only if you are in a safe column. There are $q$ safe columns: $b_1, b_2, \\\\ldots, b_q$. You want to collect all the treasures as fast as possible.

You can move up, left, or right, but not down. Moving up is only allowed in safe columns. Treasures are collected instantly when you are on the same cell.\\n- Data Structures: Use a dictionary to store the minimum and maximum column indices for each row containing treasures.  Use a list to store the safe columns.\\n- Algorithm: The core idea is to use dynamic programming.  Let `dp[i][0]` be the minimum moves to collect treasures up to row `i` ending at the leftmost treasure in row `i`, and `dp[i][1]` be the minimum moves to collect treasures up to row `i` ending at the rightmost treasure in row `i`. The transition considers the shortest path between safe columns using `bisect` to efficiently find the nearest safe columns. The shortest path will either pass through the closest safe column to the left or the closest safe column to the right.\\n- Base Case: Initialize with the starting position (1, 1).\\n- Optimization: Sort the safe columns to enable binary search for efficient lookups using `bisect`.\\n- Final Result: Return the minimum of the two ending states after collecting all treasures.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can I efficiently determine the minimum moves required to travel between two treasures, given the constraint that I can only move up in safe columns?\",\n    \"How should I store the treasure locations to efficiently retrieve them during the pathfinding process?\",\n    \"Given that I can only move up in safe columns, what data structure can help me quickly find the nearest safe columns to a given column?\",\n    \"How do I handle the constraint that I must visit all treasures and can only move up in safe columns?\",\n    \"How can I use dynamic programming to optimize the calculation of the minimum moves, considering the starting position, treasure locations, and safe column restrictions?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The minimum moves can be determined by finding the closest safe column(s) to the starting and ending columns and calculating the Manhattan distance through those safe columns.  Consider the cost of moving horizontally to a safe column, then vertically, and finally horizontally to the destination.\",\n    \"A dictionary where the key is the row number and the value is a tuple containing the minimum and maximum column indices of treasures in that row is suitable. This allows for efficient retrieval of the leftmost and rightmost treasure positions in each row.\",\n    \"A sorted list of safe column indices is ideal, as it enables the use of binary search (using `bisect`) to quickly find the nearest safe columns to any given column.\",\n    \"The problem can be viewed as an optimization problem. The treasures can be grouped by row, and then a path can be found between the rows. Each treasure in each row must be collected, so the optimal strategy is to collect them all in each row before moving to the next row.\",\n    \"Dynamic programming can be used. The state can be defined as dp[row][side], where row is the current row, and side is whether you are currently on the left-most or right-most treasure. For each row, you transition from the prior row from either the left-most or right-most treasure in that row, through some safe column.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
