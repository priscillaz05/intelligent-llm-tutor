As part of quality control, Aizu Takada City has installed cameras on the production line to automatically verify that the images obtained by shooting each coaster are symmetrical. Each coaster is represented as a square black and white image of N x N pixels. Each pixel has a value of 0 or 1 corresponding to a white or black image.\\n\\nThis time, the software of the image analysis system will be updated along with the equipment update of the production line. The new system has been devised to reduce the amount of communication data, and data is sent from the camera to the analysis system by the following method.\\n\\n* The information of the first coaster flowing on the line is sent to the system as an N \u00d7 N pixel image.\\n* For the coaster information on the second and subsequent images, only the difference from the previous image is sent. The difference is given as a set of pixel positions that change from \\\"0 to 1\\\" or \\\"1 to 0\\\".\\n\\n\\n\\nFor C coasters, enter the pixel information of the first image and the difference information of the following C-1 image, and create a program that reports the number of coasters that are vertically symmetrical and symmetrical.\\n\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe input is given in the following format.\\n\\n\\nC N\\np11p12 ... p1N\\np21p22 ... p2N\\n::\\npN1pN2 ... pNN\\ndiff1\\ndiff2\\n::\\ndiffC-1\\n\\n\\nThe first line gives the number of coasters C (1 \u2264 C \u2264 10000) and the number of pixels N (2 \u2264 N \u2264 1000 and N is even) in the vertical and horizontal directions of the image.

The input provides the initial coaster image and subsequent differences.\\n- Data Structures: Utilize a 2D array (matrix) to represent the coaster image. Represent the differences as pairs of row and column indices.\\n- Symmetry Check: Develop a function to check if a coaster image is symmetrical both vertically and horizontally.\\n- Processing the input: Read the number of coasters (C) and dimensions (N). Read the initial image. Iterate through the remaining C-1 coasters, applying the given differences to update the image for each coaster.\\n- Applying Differences: For each subsequent coaster, read the number of differences (D) and the row and column indices of the changed pixels. Update the coaster image by toggling the pixel values at the given indices.\\n- Counting Symmetrical Coasters: After applying the differences for each coaster, check if the updated image is symmetrical and increment the counter if it is.\\n- Output the Result: After processing all coasters, print the final count of symmetrical coasters.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you represent the coaster images and the changes applied to them?\",\n    \"What is the approach to check if a coaster image is symmetrical?\",\n    \"How do you update the coaster image based on the difference information?\",\n    \"What data structures are best suited for storing the coaster image and its changes?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases or constraints that need to be considered when processing the images and calculating symmetry?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Coaster images can be represented using a 2D array (matrix) where each element represents a pixel value (0 or 1). Changes are represented as pairs of row and column indices indicating which pixels have been toggled.\",\n    \"An image is symmetrical if for every pixel (i, j), the pixel (i, N-1-j) and (N-1-i, j) and (N-1-i, N-1-j) has the same value. Check if the values match for all relevant pairs.\",\n    \"To update the coaster image, iterate through the list of differences. For each row and column index (r, c) in the difference, toggle the pixel value at image[r][c] (i.e., change 0 to 1 or 1 to 0).\",\n    \"A 2D array (list of lists in Python) is well-suited for storing the coaster image. A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a pair of row and column indices, can represent the differences.\",\n    \"Constraints include the size of N (up to 1000), the number of coasters (up to 10000), and the number of differences (up to 100). Additionally, row and column indices in the differences are 1-based, so adjustment is needed when used as indices of arrays, which are 0-based.  Also N is even.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
