The subarray must be continuous. Consider edge cases like an array with fewer than k odd numbers, or an array with no odd numbers.\\n- Identifying Algorithmic Strategy: Consider how to efficiently count the number of valid subarrays. Think about using a sliding window or prefix sum-like approach.\\n- Optimizing for Efficiency: Explore ways to avoid redundant calculations by focusing on the boundaries between the odd numbers and counting subarrays based on those boundaries. Using prefix sums to record the index of the odd numbers and then creating sub arrays with k odd number may be useful.\\n- Addressing Edge Cases: Handle cases with no odd numbers, cases where the number of odd numbers is less than K, and other such possibilities.\\n- Implementation Strategy: How to make sure the odd number sub array is continuous. Counting all the subarrays before the first and after the Kth odd number will be very useful.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can we efficiently identify the start and end indices of all continuous subarrays containing exactly k odd numbers?\",\n    \"If the array has fewer than k odd numbers, what should be the returned value?\",\n    \"How to handle the case when the input array is empty?\",\n    \"Can you explain the specific logic for updating the counts or markers when you find an odd number during iteration?\",\n    \"How do you ensure that the subarrays you're counting are continuous and contain exactly k odd numbers and not more?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"We can store the positions of odd numbers in an array.
