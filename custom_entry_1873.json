Unknowingly they made a highly powerful drink. To test the drink on others also they called some of their friends and gave a drop of it to everyone. Now they all were feeling highly energetic and thought of an unique game to play with each other.\\nAfter pondering for a while, Jesse came up with an extraordinary idea of competing in a race around a circular globe with N checkpoints each of one unit. Walter and all their other friends agreed with it.They divided themselves in $2$ teams with $N$ teammates in each team.This race has two commencing points $A$ and $B$ strictly facing each other. Walter and his team commences from $A$ point and other team starts from $B$. Both the teams start running at the same time clockwise around the globe. Speed of every player is constant throughout the race. If a player has a speed $X$ then it means that he covers a distance of $X$ units in one second.The race ends when some member of one team overtakes all members of opposite team at any point of time. Now you have to tell if any team will win the race or not.They all are stubborn and can run forever just to win the race. Help them to know if it is possible in anyway that the race will come to an end. \\nFor Clarity, you can visualize the path as a circular paths where $A$ and $B$ are opposite ends of diameter. It can be proven that the actual circumference of circle do not affect the answer.\\nIt is also possible that someone don't run at all.Keep in mind that the fastest one wins the race so does the code.\\n\\n-----Input:------\\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.

The race ends when one team overtakes all members of the other team. The input provides the number of teammates and their speeds for both teams. The task is to determine if the race will end (i.e., if one team can overtake the other).\\n- Identifying Key Conditions for a Win: A team wins if its fastest member is faster than the fastest member of the other team. This is because the fastest member of one team needs to eventually overtake all members of the opposing team. If the fastest speeds are equal, no team can overtake all members of the other team.\\n- Edge Cases: Consider the case where some or all teammates have a speed of 0. If all teammates on both teams have zero speed, the race will never end.\\n- Optimizing for Speed: The problem can be solved by simply comparing the maximum speeds of both teams. No need to simulate the race itself, which would be time-consuming and potentially unnecessary, since we only care if it is POSSIBLE for the race to end.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What condition determines if one team can overtake another team in this race?\",\n    \"If the maximum speeds of both teams are equal, what does this imply for the outcome of the race?\",\n    \"What edge cases or special scenarios should you consider when determining the winner?\",\n    \"Can you solve this problem without simulating the race, and if so, how would you optimize your approach?\",\n    \"How do you handle input with different number of test cases?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A team can overtake another team if its fastest member has a higher speed than the fastest member of the other team.\",\n    \"If the maximum speeds of both teams are equal, the race will never end because no team can overtake all members of the other team.\",\n    \"Consider the case where some or all teammates have a speed of 0, especially if all members of both teams have zero speed, meaning the race never ends.\",\n    \"Yes, this problem can be solved efficiently by simply comparing the maximum speeds of both teams; no simulation is needed. If the max speed of one team is greater than the max speed of the other, then print 'YES' else 'NO'.\",\n    \"Iterate through the test cases based on the number of test cases given at the very first line of input.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
