The traversal must prioritize left subtrees before right subtrees when nodes are on the same diagonal.\\n- Algorithmic Approach Selection: A queue (deque) can be used to store the left children of the current node. The main loop processes each node, adds its data to the output, adds the node's left child to the queue, and moves to the node's right child. When the right child is None and the queue is not empty, it pops a node from the queue and continues the traversal.\\n- Edge Case Handling: Consider the case when the root is None. Ensure the logic correctly handles empty left_q.\\n- Data Structure Selection: Use a deque for the left_q due to its efficient appendleft and pop operations, which are needed to maintain the left-to-right order of nodes on the same diagonal.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is a diagonal traversal of a binary tree, and how is it different from level order or depth-first traversals?\",\n    \"How can you maintain the order of nodes along the same diagonal, ensuring that left subtrees are processed before right subtrees?\",\n    \"What data structure would be most suitable for maintaining the order of left children to ensure they are processed in the correct sequence?\",\n    \"How does the algorithm handle nodes that do not have a right child but have left children that are part of the diagonal?\",\n    \"What is the time and space complexity of your approach, and why?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Diagonal traversal visits nodes along diagonals defined by lines of slope -1. Unlike level order, it doesn't process nodes level by level. Unlike depth-first, it follows a diagonal path.\",\n    \"To prioritize left subtrees, I will use a queue (specifically, a deque) to store the left children. By adding left children to the left of the queue and processing them before moving to the right children, the order is maintained.\",\n    \"A deque is the most suitable data structure because it allows efficient insertion (appendleft) and removal (pop) from either end, which is crucial for maintaining the order of left children.\",\n    \"When a node doesn't have a right child, the algorithm checks the queue for left children. If the queue is not empty, the next node to be processed is popped from the left of the queue.\",\n    \"The time complexity is O(N) since each node is visited once. The space complexity is O(N) because, in the worst case (a skewed tree), the queue could store all the left children.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
