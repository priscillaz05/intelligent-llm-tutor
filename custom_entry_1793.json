He will be celebrating his birthday soon, so all his $M$ freinds decided to gift him coins. They all agreed to three terms:  Everyone must gift as many coins as others. All coins given to Ivan must be different. Not less than $L$ coins from gifts altogether, must be new in Ivan's collection.\\n\\nBut his friends don't know which coins have Ivan already got in his collection. They don't want to spend money so they want to buy minimum quantity of coins, that satisfy all terms, irrespective of the Ivan's collection. Help them to find this minimum number of coins or define it's not possible to meet all the terms.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe only line of input contains 4 integers $N$, $M$, $K$, $L$ ($1 \\\\le K \\\\le N \\\\le 10^{18}$; $1 \\\\le M, \\\\, L \\\\le 10^{18}$)\u00a0\u2014 quantity of different coins, number of Ivan's friends, size of Ivan's collection and quantity of coins, that must be new in Ivan's collection.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nPrint one number\u00a0\u2014 minimal number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions.

All coins gifted must be distinct. At least L of the gifted coins must be new to Ivan.\\n- Formulating the Condition: Let 'a' be the number of coins each friend gifts. The total number of gifted coins is a * M. We need at least L new coins, which means that even in the worst case (where Ivan already has some of the coins his friends gift him), at least L new coins must be added.  This means a * M - (number of duplicate coins) >= L. The maximum possible duplicate coins would be K coins.\\n- Deriving the Formula: In the worst case, $L + K$ coins will be gifted. Thus, the number of coins gifted by each friend, $a$, must satisfy $a * M >= L + K$. Therefore, $a >= (L + K) / M$. Since $a$ must be an integer, we take the ceiling of $(L+K)/M$.\\n- Checking Feasibility:  The total number of coins gifted ($a * M$) must not exceed the total number of different coins $N$. If $a * M > N$, the problem is not solvable, and we output -1.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the given parameters, and what do they represent?\",\n    \"What does 'irrespective of Ivan's collection' mean in this context?\",\n    \"What is the minimum number of coins needed in total to satisfy the condition that at least $L$ coins are new?\",\n    \"How do you find the minimum coins each friend can gift?\",\n    \"What condition indicates it's impossible to satisfy the condition?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"N is the total number of different collectible coins.
