To avoid this, the input array needs to be sorted first. Then, while creating the subsets, a check is needed to skip the duplicates.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Backtracking is a suitable approach to explore all possible subsets. Start from the first element, either include it in the subset or exclude it. Recursive calls are used to generate all combinations.\\n- Avoiding Duplicate Subsets: Within the backtracking approach, ensure the addition of unique subsets only. This involves skipping duplicate numbers during the recursive calls. 'if j > i and nums[j] == nums[j - 1]: continue'  This check ensures that when we have considered nums[i] in the subset, we don't consider the same number again right next to it.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the definition of a subset, and how does it relate to the power set?\",\n    \"How does the presence of duplicate numbers in the input affect the generation of unique subsets?\",\n    \"What is a suitable algorithmic strategy to explore all possible subsets?\",\n    \"How can we avoid generating duplicate subsets when the input array contains duplicate numbers?\",\n    \"How can the backtracking algorithm be modified to ensure that only unique subsets are generated?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A subset is a set containing some or all elements from the original set.

Specifically, when iterating through the array, if the current element is the same as the previous one and the current index is greater than the starting index, skip the current element.
