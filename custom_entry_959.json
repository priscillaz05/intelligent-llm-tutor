For that reason she can rearrange the letters of the string.\\n\\nFor example, if she has string \\\"xiineteenppnnnewtnee\\\", she can get string \\\"xnineteenppnineteenw\\\", containing (the occurrences marked) two such words. More formally, word \\\"nineteen\\\" occurs in the string the number of times you can read it starting from some letter of the string. Of course, you shouldn't skip letters.\\n\\nHelp her to find the maximum number of \\\"nineteen\\\"s that she can get in her string.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains a non-empty string s, consisting only of lowercase English letters.

The word \\\"nineteen\\\" has the following letters: n (3 times), i (1 time), e (3 times), t (1 time).\\n- Devising a Strategy: Count the occurrences of each of these letters in the input string. Then, determine the limiting factor for forming the word \\\"nineteen\\\" based on the counts of these letters.\\n- Edge Cases: Account for cases where there are not enough of a particular letter. Also, handle the case where there might be enough of some letters but not enough of others.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What letters are required to form the word \\\"nineteen\\\" and how many times does each letter appear?\",\n    \"How can you determine the maximum number of \\\"nineteen\\\" words you can form given the counts of the required letters?\",\n    \"How do you handle the fact that the letter 'n' and 'e' appear multiple times in the word \\\"nineteen\\\"?\",\n    \"What are the limiting factors that determine the maximum number of \\\"nineteen\\\" words we can form?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases to consider, such as when certain required letters are absent or insufficient in number?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The word \\\"nineteen\\\" requires the following letters and counts: 'n' (3), 'i' (1), 'e' (3), and 't' (1).\",\n    \"You can determine the maximum number of \\\"nineteen\\\" words by finding the minimum value of the following: count('i'), count('e') // 3, count('t'), and an adjusted value based on count('n').\",\n    \"Since 'n' appears 3 times and 'e' appears 3 times, you need to divide the number of occurrences of 'e' by 3 and consider the count of 'n' appropriately. The number of 'n' is a bit tricky and depends on the minimum number of 'i', 'e', and 't'.\",\n    \"The limiting factors are the letters with the fewest available counts relative to their frequency in the word \\\"nineteen\\\" (i.e. 'i', 't', or 'e' with its count divided by 3, or 'n' considered based on the counts of others).\",\n    \"Edge cases include scenarios where one or more of the required letters are absent or their counts are so low that even forming a single \\\"nineteen\\\" word is impossible.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
