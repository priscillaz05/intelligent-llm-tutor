The sum of each row, column, and diagonal must be the same magic constant (which is 15 for a 3x3 magic square with numbers 1-9).\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: The integers in the matrix must be distinct and within the range [1, 9]. Each transformation (changing a number) has a cost of the absolute difference between the original and new number.  The problem requires finding the minimum possible cost to convert the given matrix into a magic square.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Generate all possible magic squares (there are only 8). For each possible magic square, calculate the cost to transform the given input matrix to that magic square. Return the minimum of these costs.\\n- Implementing the Solution: Use itertools.permutations to generate all possible permutations of the numbers 1 to 9. Filter these permutations to identify valid magic squares (using the row, column and diagonal sum conditions). Calculate the cost for each valid magic square by summing the absolute differences between each element in the input matrix and the corresponding element in the possible magic square. Keep track of the minimum cost found so far and update it when a lower cost is found.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What defines a magic square, specifically a 3x3 magic square with numbers from 1 to 9?\",\n    \"How can we efficiently find all possible magic squares, given the constraint that numbers must be distinct and within the range [1, 9]?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the cost of converting the given input square to a particular magic square?\",\n    \"How would you manage the constraint that the integers in the matrix must be distinct?\",\n    \"What is the magic constant for a 3x3 magic square containing the numbers 1 through 9?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A magic square is a square matrix where the sum of numbers in each row, column, and diagonal is the same.
