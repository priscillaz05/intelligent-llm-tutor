The i-th road goes from intersection a_i to b_i and has length l_i miles. \\n\\nThere are q cars that may only drive along those roads. The i-th car starts at intersection v_i and has an odometer that begins at s_i, increments for each mile driven, and resets to 0 whenever it reaches t_i. Phoenix has been tasked to drive cars along some roads (possibly none) and return them to their initial intersection with the odometer showing 0.\\n\\nFor each car, please find if this is possible. \\n\\nA car may visit the same road or intersection an arbitrary number of times. The odometers don't stop counting the distance after resetting, so odometers may also be reset an arbitrary number of times.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5; 1 \u2264 m \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of intersections and the number of roads, respectively.\\n\\nEach of the next m lines contain three integers a_i, b_i, and l_i (1 \u2264 a_i, b_i \u2264 n; a_i \u2260 b_i; 1 \u2264 l_i \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the information about the i-th road. The graph is not necessarily connected. It is guaranteed that between any two intersections, there is at most one road for each direction.\\n\\nThe next line contains an integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of cars.\\n\\nEach of the next q lines contains three integers v_i, s_i, and t_i (1 \u2264 v_i \u2264 n; 0 \u2264 s_i < t_i \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the initial intersection of the i-th car, the initial number on the i-th odometer, and the number at which the i-th odometer resets, respectively.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nPrint q answers. If the i-th car's odometer may be reset to 0 by driving through some roads (possibly none) and returning to its starting intersection v_i, print YES.

The goal is to determine if each car can return to its starting intersection with its odometer showing 0.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints and Conditions: The cars must return to their starting point. The odometer must read 0 at the end. Cars can travel the same roads multiple times. The graph may not be fully connected.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Approach: Identifying strongly connected components (SCCs) is important, because to come back to the original position, you have to be inside an SCC. Within each SCC, the key is to find the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of all possible cycle lengths. Use the GCD to determine if it is possible to return to the origin with the odometer at 0.\\n- Implementation Details: Use Tarjan's algorithm for finding SCCs. Calculate the GCD of cycle lengths within each SCC using a BFS/DFS like approach. For each query, check if the starting odometer value 's' can be made 0 modulo the reset value 't' using combinations of cycle lengths (GCD) in the SCC. If the car's starting intersection is not part of an SCC that has cycle lengths, then the odometer must start at zero.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do strongly connected components relate to solving this problem?\",\n    \"How can you find the GCD of cycle lengths within an SCC efficiently?\",\n    \"What does it mean if scgcd[sclis[vi]] == float('inf')\",\n    \"What is the significance of checking if -1 * si % ti % math.gcd(scgcd[sclis[vi]], ti) == 0\",\n    \"How can the graph not being connected affect the final output and what special handling must be done?\",\n    \"How is Tarjan's algorithm used and why is it appropriate here?\",\n    \"How does traversing roads multiple times change the possible paths and what restrictions does this lift?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Returning to the starting point requires being in a strongly connected component (SCC). If a car starts in an SCC, it can potentially cycle through roads in that SCC to reset its odometer. If it is not inside an SCC where it's possible to cycle, it will not be possible to return to the origin with odometer zero unless it starts at zero.\",\n    \"You can use BFS or DFS within each SCC. Keep track of the distances (lengths) from a starting node to other nodes. If you encounter a node you've already visited, the difference in distances gives you a cycle length. Calculate the GCD of all such cycle lengths found in the SCC.\",\n    \"It means that the car's start intersection is inside an SCC that cannot have its odometer manipulated by cycles (either no cycles exist, or it's impossible to move to other roads from that start). In that case the starting odometer must start at zero to be 'YES', otherwise it will return 'NO'.\",\n    \"This checks if the initial odometer reading (si) can be reduced to 0 modulo the odometer reset value (ti) by repeatedly subtracting multiples of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the cycle lengths within the strongly connected component (scgcd[sclis[vi]]) and the reset value (ti). In simpler terms, it verifies if the starting odometer value is compatible with the possible cycle lengths and the reset value, allowing it to eventually reach 0.\",\n    \"If the graph isn't connected, some intersections might not be reachable from others. It's crucial to only consider SCCs that contain the car's starting intersection. If the car's starting intersection is in a weakly connected component that doesn't have cycles allowing the odometer to reset, the algorithm will return 'NO', unless the starting odometer is already 0.\",\n    \"Tarjan's algorithm efficiently identifies strongly connected components (SCCs) in the graph. It is appropriate here because the problem requires analyzing cycles and connectivity to determine if a car can return to its starting intersection with a zeroed odometer. SCCs group nodes that are mutually reachable, which is essential for finding paths that lead back to the starting point.\",\n    \"Traversing roads multiple times allows for the creation of cycles. This lifts the restriction of having to take a new road each time and means we only have to ensure we can come back, not how long it takes to come back. Multiple roads can be taken any amount of times as long as the odometer returns to zero upon return.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
