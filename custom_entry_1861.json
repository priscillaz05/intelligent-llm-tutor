Note the constraints on the array's length and the range of salary values, and that the salaries are unique.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Consider edge cases such as very small arrays (minimum length is 3) and the uniqueness constraint. Avoid division by zero if the array becomes empty after removing the min and max values.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Use sorting to easily find the minimum and maximum values. Then, remove the minimum and maximum values and calculate the average of the remaining values.\\n- Implementing the Solution: Sort the array. Remove the first and last elements. Sum the remaining elements and divide by the new length of the array.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the constraints on the input array salary, and how might they affect the solution?\",\n    \"How would you find the minimum and maximum salaries in the most efficient way?\",\n    \"Once you've identified the minimum and maximum salaries, what's the next step to compute the average?\",\n    \"What potential issues might arise in the calculation, and how would you address them?\",\n    \"Given the requirement for an accurate floating-point result, what considerations should you keep in mind?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The constraints are that the array has at least 3 elements, each salary is unique and within the range of 1000 to 1000000.
