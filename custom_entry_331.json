The mansion consists of a roof, a ceiling, walls, and a floor. The output string must conform to specific formatting rules with respect to spacing.\\n- Decomposing the Structure: The mansion can be logically divided into the roof, ceiling, walls and the floor. Each part can be built separately.\\n- Roof Construction Strategy: The roof consists of lines with `/` and `\\\\` characters. These lines need to be generated based on the floor number, with spaces at the beginning and end of the lines. The number of spaces decreases as the floor increases.\\n- Ceiling and Wall Construction: The ceiling consists of `/` and `\\\\` symbols with `_` in between. The walls are `|` and `|` with spaces between. The floor is similar to the ceiling.\\n- Combining Parts: Finally, the roof, ceiling, walls and the floor are combined to produce the final output string.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the structure of the mansion in terms of roof, ceiling, walls, and floor, and how are they connected?\",\n    \"How does the number of floors `n` affect the construction of each part of the mansion (roof, ceiling, walls, floor)?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the number of leading/trailing spaces for each line of the roof based on the floor number?\",\n    \"What is the relationship between the floor number and the number of spaces or underscores within the ceiling, walls, and floor?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently create the walls section, given that it repeats a similar pattern for `n - 1` times?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The mansion consists of a roof at the top, followed by a ceiling, then walls in the middle, and finally the floor at the bottom. The roof provides the shape, the ceiling connects the roof to the walls, walls provide the body of the mansion and floor provides the base of the mansion.\",\n    \"The number of floors `n` determines the height of the roof (number of lines), the width of the ceiling/floor, and the number of wall segments. The roof consists of `n` lines, and the number of wall segments is `n - 1`.\",\n    \"The number of leading/trailing spaces for the i-th line of the roof (where i starts from 0) is `n - i`. This ensures that the roof narrows as it goes up.\",\n    \"The number of spaces or underscores within the ceiling, walls, and floor is directly proportional to the number of floors. Specifically, it's `n * 2`.\",\n    \"The walls section can be created by repeating the wall pattern `n - 1` times using string multiplication. For example, if the wall pattern is `'|   |\\\\n'`, you can repeat it as `'|   |\\\\n' * (n - 1)`.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
