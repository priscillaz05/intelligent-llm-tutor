However, he is sure that he cannot solve the problem in the remaining time. From experience, he figures out that he needs exactly $H$ hours to solve the problem. \\n\\nNow Chef finally decides to use his special power which he has gained through years of intense yoga. He can travel back in time when he concentrates. Specifically, his power allows him to travel to $N$ different time zones, which are $T_{1}, T_{2}, \\\\ldots, T_{N}$ hours respectively behind his current time.\\n\\nFind out whether Chef can use one of the available time zones to solve the problem and submit it before the contest ends.\\n\\n------  Input ------\\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers $N$, $H$ and $x$.\\nThe second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $T_{1}, T_{2}, \\\\ldots, T_{N}$.\\n\\n------  Output ------\\nPrint a single line containing the string \\\"YES\\\" if Chef can solve the problem on time or \\\"NO\\\" if he cannot.\\n\\nYou may print each character of each string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings \\\"yEs\\\", \\\"yes\\\", \\\"Yes\\\" and \\\"YES\\\" will all be treated as identical).\\n\\n------  Constraints ------\\n$1 \\\\leq N \\\\leq 100$\\n$1 \\\\leq x < H \\\\leq 100$\\n$1 \\\\leq T_{i} \\\\leq 100$ for each valid $i$\\n\\n------  Subtasks ------\\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\\n\\n----- Sample Input 1 ------ \\n2 5 3\\n1 2\\n----- Sample Output 1 ------ \\nYES\\n----- explanation 1 ------ \\nChef already has $3$ hours left. He can go to the $2$-nd time zone, which is $2$ hours back in time.

Chef needs H hours to solve the problem and has x hours remaining. He can travel to N time zones, each offering a different amount of time (Ti hours).\\n- Identifying the Core Logic: We need to check if any of the time zones, when added to the existing time x, will give Chef enough time to solve the problem (H hours or more).\\n- Algorithm Selection: Iterate through the time zones and check if x + Ti >= H for any Ti. If such a time zone is found, Chef can solve the problem, and we output \\\"YES\\\". If no such time zone is found, we output \\\"NO\\\".\\n- Edge Cases and Constraints: The constraints mention 1 <= N <= 100, 1 <= x < H <= 100, and 1 <= Ti <= 100. This means we need to handle cases where the number of time zones is significant and each time zone provides a relatively small amount of time. Since x < H always, we can be sure that at least some extra time travel will be needed.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the input parameters, and what do they represent?\",\n    \"What condition must be met for Chef to be able to solve the problem?\",\n    \"How should the output be formatted, and what are the possible output values?\",\n    \"What if none of the timezones provides enough extra time?\",\n    \"How to handle cases when multiple timezones provide enough extra time?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The input consists of N (number of time zones), H (hours needed to solve the problem), x (hours remaining), and a list of N time zones T1, T2, ..., TN.\",\n    \"Chef can solve the problem if there exists a time zone Ti such that x + Ti >= H.\",\n    \"The output should be a single line containing either \\\"YES\\\" or \\\"NO\\\", case-insensitive.\",\n    \"If x + Ti < H for all i, then the output should be \\\"NO\\\".\",\n    \"If multiple time zones satisfy the condition x + Ti >= H, you only need to output \\\"YES\\\" once since finding one valid timezone is enough to solve the problem.
