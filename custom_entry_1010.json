However, he knows that everyone will have exactly one slice of a pizza (regardless of the size) and he wants to make sure that he has enough pizza slices. \\nChef is very lazy and will only make a total of N straight cuts among all the pizzas. Each pizza is also of different size and to avoid the slices getting too small the chef can only make a max of Ai cuts to the ith pizza. He wants to maximize the number of slices of pizza. Since chef is busy with preparing other aspects of the party he wants you to find out the maximum number of slices he can get following the constraints. \\nIf a pizza is not cut at all then it is considered as 1 slice.  \\n\\n-----Input-----\\nFirst line contains two integers M and N.\\nThe second line of input contains the array A.\\n\\n-----Output-----\\nOutput a single integer - the maximum number of slices chef can get.\\n\\n-----Constraints-----\\n- 1 \u2264 M \u2264 2*105\\n- 1 \u2264 N,Ai \u2264 2*105\\n\\n-----Subtasks-----\\n- Subtask 1: 1 \u2264 M,N \u2264 100 - 10 points \\n- Subtask 2: 1 \u2264 N \u2264 100, \\n1 \u2264 M \u2264 105 - 20 points\\n- Subtask 3: Original Constraints - 70 points\\n\\n-----Example-----\\nInput:\\n5 10\\n1 2 3 4 5\\nOutput:\\n31\\n\\n-----Explanation-----\\nExample case 1.

Each pizza can have a maximum of Ai cuts. Not cutting a pizza results in 1 slice.\\n- Objective: To determine the number of cuts for each pizza to maximize the total slices.\\n- Constraints: Total cuts cannot exceed N, and each pizza i can have at most Ai cuts.\\n- Formula: Number of slices from x cuts on one pizza = x + 1. The formula to maximize slices, we need to use the cut value that gives maximum slices. The number of slices you can get from one pizza when you cut it 'k' times is k * (k+1) / 2 + 1.\\n- Optimization Strategy: Prioritize pizzas with higher A[i] values to utilize more cuts.\\n- Algorithm:\\n1. Sort the A[i] array in descending order.\\n2. Iterate through each pizza and try to make as many cuts as possible based on A[i] and the remaining cuts N.\\n3. Calculate total slices. slices += (cuts * (cuts + 1) / 2) + 1.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you approach maximizing the total number of slices given the constraints on total cuts and cuts per pizza?\",\n    \"Why is it important to sort the array of maximum cuts for each pizza and what is the optimal sorting order?\",\n    \"How do you ensure that the total cuts do not exceed N, and how does this affect the algorithm's cut distribution?\",\n    \"Given that the number of slices for 'x' cuts on one pizza = x + 1, how do you adapt this to incorporate the fact that a pizza with no cuts yields one slice, and what's the number of slices you can get from one pizza when you cut it 'k' times?\",\n    \"What edge cases or scenarios could significantly impact the efficiency or correctness of the solution, and how would you address them?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Maximize total slices by prioritizing pizzas with higher A[i] values, and by using remaining cuts 'N' for the pizza.\",\n    \"Sorting is important because distributing cuts to pizzas with higher cut capacity first maximizes the slice count. We sort in descending order to prioritize the largest A[i].\",\n    \"Check the total cuts remain less than N cuts, we need to only add as many cuts which is possible using N and then update N. This ensures algorithm correctness.\",\n    \"The statement 'number of slices for x cuts on one pizza = x + 1' is not mathematically correct. If we do k cuts, slices will be (k * (k + 1) // 2) + 1, and that's the number of slices you can get from one pizza when you cut it 'k' times.\",\n    \"Edge cases include when N = 0, where the answer is simply M because no pizza is cut. Another case is when all Ai are 0, then output will be M. Consider the case N is a very large number\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
