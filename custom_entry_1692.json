"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"In \\\"Takahashi-ya\\\", a ramen restaurant, a bowl of ramen costs 700 yen (the currency of Japan), plus 100 yen for each kind of topping (boiled egg, sliced pork, green onions).\\nA customer ordered a bowl of ramen and told which toppings to put on his ramen to a clerk. The clerk took a memo of the order as a string S. S is three characters long, and if the first character in S is o, it means the ramen should be topped with boiled egg; if that character is x, it means the ramen should not be topped with boiled egg. Similarly, the second and third characters in S mean the presence or absence of sliced pork and green onions on top of the ramen.\\nWrite a program that, when S is given, prints the price of the corresponding bowl of ramen.\\n\\n-----Constraints-----\\n - S is a string of length 3.\\n - Each character in S is o or x.\\n\\n-----Input-----\\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\\nS\\n\\n-----Output-----\\nPrint the price of the bowl of ramen corresponding to S.\\n\\n-----Sample Input-----\\noxo\\n\\n-----Sample Output-----\\n900\\n\\nThe price of a ramen topped with two kinds of toppings, boiled egg and green onions, is 700 + 100 \\\\times 2 = 900 yen.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"print(700 + input().count('o') * 100)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem describes calculating the price of a bowl of ramen based on the base price (700 yen) and the number of toppings ordered (100 yen per topping).\\n- Identifying Inputs and Outputs: The input is a string S of length 3, where each character indicates whether a topping is included ('o') or not ('x'). The output is the total price of the ramen as an integer.\\n- Devising a Strategy: The strategy involves reading the input string, counting the number of 'o' characters (representing the number of toppings), multiplying that count by 100, and adding the result to the base price of 700.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you read the input string S?\",\n    \"How can you count the number of 'o' characters in the input string?\",\n    \"How can you calculate the final price of the ramen based on the number of toppings?\",\n    \"What data type should the output be?\",\n    \"Are there any edge cases or special conditions to consider?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"You can read the input string S using the input() function.\",\n    \"You can count the number of 'o' characters in the input string using the count() method.\",\n    \"The final price is calculated as 700 + (number of 'o's * 100).\",\n    \"The output should be an integer representing the total price.\",\n    \"There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the problem. However, the length of the input string will always be 3 and composed of 'o' or 'x'.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
