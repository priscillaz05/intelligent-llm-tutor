(Image courtesy of See Bang)\\n\\nThe journey can be represented as a straight line, consisting of $n$ segments. Bob is located to the left of the first segment, while Alice's nest is on the right of the last segment. Each segment has a length in meters, and also terrain type: grass, water or lava. \\n\\nBob has three movement types: swimming, walking and flying. He can switch between them or change his direction at any point in time (even when he is located at a non-integer coordinate), and doing so doesn't require any extra time. Bob can swim only on the water, walk only on the grass and fly over any terrain. Flying one meter takes $1$ second, swimming one meter takes $3$ seconds, and finally walking one meter takes $5$ seconds.\\n\\nBob has a finite amount of energy, called stamina. Swimming and walking is relaxing for him, so he gains $1$ stamina for every meter he walks or swims. On the other hand, flying is quite tiring, and he spends $1$ stamina for every meter flown. Staying in place does not influence his stamina at all. Of course, his stamina can never become negative. Initially, his stamina is zero.\\n\\nWhat is the shortest possible time in which he can reach Alice's nest? \\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$\u00a0($1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of segments of terrain. \\n\\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $l_1, l_2, \\\\dots, l_n$\u00a0($1 \\\\leq l_i \\\\leq 10^{12}$). The $l_i$ represents the length of the $i$-th terrain segment in meters.\\n\\nThe third line contains a string $s$ consisting of $n$ characters \\\"G\\\", \\\"W\\\", \\\"L\\\", representing Grass, Water and Lava, respectively. \\n\\nIt is guaranteed that the first segment is not Lava.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nOutput a single integer $t$\u00a0\u2014 the minimum time Bob needs to reach Alice. \\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n1\\n10\\nG\\n\\nOutput\\n30\\n\\nInput\\n2\\n10 10\\nWL\\n\\nOutput\\n40\\n\\nInput\\n2\\n1 2\\nWL\\n\\nOutput\\n8\\n\\nInput\\n3\\n10 10 10\\nGLW\\n\\nOutput\\n80\\n\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first sample, Bob first walks $5$ meters in $25$ seconds. Then he flies the remaining $5$ meters in $5$ seconds.\\n\\nIn the second sample, Bob first swims $10$ meters in $30$ seconds. Then he flies over the patch of lava for $10$ seconds.\\n\\nIn the third sample, the water pond is much smaller. Bob first swims over the water pond, taking him $3$ seconds. However, he cannot fly over the lava just yet, as he only has one stamina while he needs two. So he swims back for half a meter, and then half a meter forward, taking him $3$ seconds in total. Now he has $2$ stamina, so he can spend $2$ seconds flying over the lava.\\n\\nIn the fourth sample, he walks for $50$ seconds, flies for $10$ seconds, swims for $15$ seconds, and finally flies for $5$ seconds.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"n = int(input())\\ndis = list(map(lambda x: int(x) << 1, input().split()))\\nter = input()\\n(st, ans) = (0, 0)\\ntime = {'G': 5, 'W': 3, 'L': 1}\\ndelta = {'G': 1, 'W': 1, 'L': -1}\\nhasWater = False\\nconvert = 0\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\tst += dis[i] * delta[ter[i]]\\n\\tans += dis[i] * time[ter[i]]\\n\\tif ter[i] == 'W':\\n\\t\\thasWater = True\\n\\telif ter[i] == 'G':\\n\\t\\tconvert += dis[i]\\n\\tif st < 0:\\n\\t\\tif hasWater:\\n\\t\\t\\tans += -st * 3\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tans += -st * 5\\n\\t\\tst = 0\\n\\tconvert = min(convert, st // 2)\\nans -= 4 * convert\\nans -= 2 * (st // 2 - convert)\\nprint(ans // 2)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding Problem Constraints: The problem involves minimizing the time for Bob to reach Alice's nest by choosing the optimal combination of walking, swimming, and flying across different terrains while managing stamina.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Bob's stamina must never be negative. There are different time costs for each terrain. The first segment cannot be lava. Optimizing the use of terrain to maximize stamina recovery before flying is important.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Use a dynamic programming or greedy approach to determine the optimal path for Bob. At each segment, consider the three options and their stamina/time trade-offs. Account for the edge case of not being able to fly due to stamina.\\n- Implementing In-Place Modification: Keep track of current stamina and time as Bob traverses the segments. When the stamina becomes negative, strategically walk or swim to replenish stamina.\\n- Optimizing Stamina Use: Convert walking or swimming distance into stamina before flying whenever possible, to reduce overall time spent.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the primary constraints of the problem, specifically regarding terrain types and stamina management?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: Bob can only walk on grass, swim on water, and fly over any terrain.

Stamina cannot be negative, and the starting stamina is 0.\",\n    \"How do the different travel modes (walking, swimming, flying) affect the total time and stamina, and what are the key differences?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: Walking costs 5 seconds per meter and increases stamina by 1. Swimming costs 3 seconds per meter and increases stamina by 1. Flying costs 1 second per meter and decreases stamina by 1. The key is the stamina cost-benefit ratio.\",\n    \"What strategies can you employ to optimize the route when Bob's stamina is low, particularly when encountering lava segments?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: If stamina is insufficient for flying over lava, Bob can regain stamina by swimming back and forth in water or walking back and forth on grass segments. The optimal approach will depend on the length and cost (time) of traversing each terrain.\",\n    \"How can dynamic programming be applied to solve this problem, and what state variables are needed to track Bob's progress?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: Define the state as DP[i][s], where i is the segment number and s is the stamina level. DP[i][s] stores the minimum time to reach segment i with stamina s. The transitions will involve calculating the time and stamina changes for walking, swimming, and flying, and choosing the minimum time to reach each state.\",\n    \"How do you handle the very large lengths (up to 10^12) for the segments when calculating stamina changes?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: The segment lengths can be very large. We should avoid calculating stamina changes individually for each meter.
