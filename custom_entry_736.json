The input consists of multiple such odd numbers, and the program should output the primes for each or '0 0 0' if no such primes exist.\\n- Algorithm Selection and Construction: Since the numbers are relatively small (less than 10^6), pre-calculating a list of primes up to 10^6 is efficient. Then, the `solve` function can iterate through possible prime numbers for P3 and P2 (in reverse order to possibly find solutions faster, since larger primes reduce the remaining value for P1), and then check if the remaining value is also a prime. A Sieve of Eratosthenes is an efficient algorithm for generating the prime list.\\n- Implementation Details: Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate a boolean array `primes` where `primes[i]` is true if `i` is prime. Then, within the solve function, iterate backwards through primes to find suitable P2 and P3 values and subsequently calculate P1. If a valid P1 is prime, return [P1, P2, P3]. If no such primes are found after checking all combinations, return [0, 0, 0].\\n- Optimizations and Edge Cases: The range of the search can be reduced to primes less than the cube root and square root of the input number since p3^3 and p2^2 have to be less than n. However, since we precompute primes to 10^6 we do not have to determine that constraint within the search loop. Using a reverse search order from large primes to smaller ones might lead to finding a valid answer faster, but it will not impact the correctness of the solution.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you efficiently pre-calculate a list of prime numbers up to 10^6?\",\n    \"In the `solve` function, what would be an efficient search strategy for finding prime numbers P1, P2, and P3 that satisfy the equation?\",\n    \"How can you optimize your search or algorithm to reduce the runtime and computational complexity?\",\n    \"What are the possible edge cases, and how do you account for them in your solution?\",\n    \"Why iterate in reverse order of the prime numbers to find a solution faster?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The Sieve of Eratosthenes can be used to efficiently pre-calculate prime numbers. You create a boolean array where each index represents a number, and iteratively mark non-prime numbers by starting from the smallest prime and marking its multiples as false.\",\n    \"Since we have p1 + p2^2 + p3^3 = N, we can iterate through possible p3 and p2 values such that both p3^3 and p2^2 are smaller than N. Then we check to see if p1 = N - (p2^2 + p3^3) is a positive prime number. \",\n    \"One potential optimization is to search primes in reverse order for finding P2 and P3, as larger numbers will narrow down P1 faster. However, the pre-calculation with Sieve of Eratosthenes already minimizes runtime. \",\n    \"If no combination of primes results in a solution, the program must return '0 0 0'. This can be achieved by exhausting all combinations within the search loop before returning the default zero values.\",\n    \"Iterating in reverse order from large prime numbers to smaller ones is a common heuristic to possibly find a solution faster, as it helps reducing the remaining value that P1 should take for a given input N.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
