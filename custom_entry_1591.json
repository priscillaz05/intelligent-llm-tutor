If the sum equals 15, print '+'. If the product equals 15, print '*'. If neither condition is met, print 'x'. The constraints limit the input integers to the range [1, 15].\\n- Handling the Mutually Exclusive Condition: The prompt specifies that both the sum and product cannot be equal to 15 at the same time. This simplifies the logic since we can use `elif`.\\n- Selecting the Correct Order of Evaluation: Because the problem states that \\\"a+b=15 and a\\\\times b=15 do not hold at the same time\\\", and based on the examples, multiplication is prioritized. So the program must check for multiplication first and then check for addition.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the possible values of a and b according to the problem's constraints?\",\n    \"What output should be printed if both conditions (a+b=15 and a*b=15) are false?\",\n    \"Which condition should be checked first: a+b=15 or a*b=15, and why?\",\n    \"If a + b equals 15, what character should the program print?\",\n    \"If a * b equals 15, what character should the program print?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The problem states that 1 <= a, b <= 15, meaning both a and b must be integers between 1 and 15 inclusive.\",\n    \"If neither a+b=15 nor a*b=15 holds true, the program should print 'x'.\",\n    \"Based on the problem description and the provided examples, a*b=15 should be checked first, because the problem prioritizes multiplication over addition.\",\n    \"If a + b equals 15, the program should print '+'.\",\n    \"If a * b equals 15, the program should print '*'.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
