If you have an empty array, you need to return it.\\n\\n*Example*\\n```python\\nsort_array([5, 3, 2, 8, 1, 4]) == [1, 3, 2, 8, 5, 4]\\n```\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def sort_array(arr):\\n\\todds = sorted((x for x in arr if x % 2 != 0), reverse=True)\\n\\treturn [x if x % 2 == 0 else odds.pop() for x in arr]\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: Clearly define the task of sorting only the odd numbers in ascending order while keeping the even numbers in their original positions. Recognize that zero is considered even.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Consider the edge case of an empty input array, which should be returned as is.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: Separate the odd numbers from the array, sort them in ascending order. Then, rebuild the array by iterating through the original array and placing the sorted odd numbers and original even numbers in the appropriate positions.\\n- Data Structures: Use a temporary data structure (like a list) to store the odd numbers separately.\\n- Rebuilding the Array: Correctly insert the sorted odd numbers back into the original array at the positions where odd numbers were initially located.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What should the function return if the input array is empty?\",\n    \"How should zero be handled in the sorting process?\",\n    \"How can you differentiate between odd and even numbers in the array?\",\n    \"What data structure would be suitable for temporarily storing the odd numbers for sorting?\",\n    \"How do you ensure that the even numbers remain in their original positions when reconstructing the array?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"If the input array is empty, the function should return the empty array as is.\",\n    \"Zero should be treated as an even number and should not be moved during the sorting process.\",\n    \"You can use the modulo operator (%) to determine if a number is odd or even.

If it's even, place it directly into the result array. If it's odd, replace it with the next sorted odd number from the temporary list.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
