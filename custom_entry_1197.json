Recognize the limitations that the array cannot be modified, only constant extra space can be used, and the runtime must be less than O(n^2).\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Consider the challenge of identifying the duplicate number within O(1) space and without modifying the array, which makes typical counting or sorting methods unsuitable. Consider the edge case of an empty array.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Investigate the adaptation of Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm (tortoise and hare) to find the duplicate number, treating the array as a linked list where nums[i] points to the next node.\\n- Mapping the Array to a Linked List: Conceptualize the array as a linked list where the value at each index represents the next node to visit, and a duplicate value will create a cycle in this linked list.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Given the constraints (no modifying the array and O(1) space), what common approaches for finding duplicates are immediately ruled out?\",\n    \"How can you adapt Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm to the given problem of finding a duplicate number in an array?\",\n    \"In the context of this problem, how would you simulate the movement of the slow and fast pointers through the array?\",\n    \"What is the significance of the point where the slow and fast pointers meet in Floyd's algorithm, and how does it relate to finding the starting point of the cycle (the duplicate number)?\",\n    \"After detecting the cycle, how do you reset one of the pointers to the beginning of the array, and what's the process for finding the duplicate number?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Approaches like sorting or using a hash map are ruled out because they either modify the array or require more than O(1) extra space.\",\n    \"Adapt the array as a linked list.
