They will probably hate it if they know that not many people come with them.\\n\\nAlso, some of my friends are always shy, though they always want to stand out. They will surely hate if too many or too few people come with them.\\n\\nThis kind of thing should be more fun to do in large numbers. That's why I want to invite as many friends as possible. However, it is not good to force a friend you dislike.\\n\\nHow many friends can I invite up to?\\n\\nI'm not very good at this kind of problem that seems to use my head. So I have a request for you.

The goal is to maximize the number of invited friends such that everyone invited is happy with the total attendance (including yourself).\\n- Defining Constraints: The i-th friend is happy if the total number of attendees is between ai and bi, inclusive. The total number of attendees includes yourself. Therefore, if you invite 'k' friends, the total number of attendees is 'k+1'.\\n- Algorithmic Approach: Iterate through possible numbers of friends invited (from 0 to N). For each potential number of invitees, check how many friends would be happy with that number of attendees (k+1). If the number of happy friends is equal to the number of friends invited, then that is a possible solution. Keep track of the maximum number of friends that can be invited while satisfying all the constraints.\\n- Implementation Details: Represent the number of friends and their preferences. Iterate through possible numbers of invited friends, and for each number, count the happy friends. Update maximum count and print result.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do I interpret the input constraints to formulate a mathematical condition for friend satisfaction?\",\n    \"How does the inclusion of 'myself' in the total attendees affect the constraints?\",\n    \"Given a specific number of friends I invite, how can I determine efficiently if that number is a valid solution?\",\n    \"How do I manage the range of possible total attendee numbers (including myself) and the friends' preferences?\",\n    \"What data structure can be used effectively to track friend preferences, and how can it be utilized to improve computation efficiency?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The i-th friend is satisfied if a_i <= (number of invited friends + 1) <= b_i. This must hold true for all invited friends.\",\n    \"It means if 'k' friends are invited, the total number of attendees is 'k+1'. This value must fall within the preference range [a_i, b_i] for each friend i invited.\",\n    \"Iterate through all friends. If you've invited 'k' friends, check if 'k+1' falls within their respective [a_i, b_i] ranges. The count of happy friends must be equal to 'k' for this to be a valid solution. Check this for each potential invitation size.\",\n    \"We need to iterate through possible numbers of invited friends. The number of attendees will range from 1 (myself) to N+1 (all friends plus myself). So we need to check attendee numbers between 1 and N+1. We can iterate on `k` from 0 to `N` and see if we can invite k friends.\",\n    \"An array 'diff' where `diff[a] += 1` and `diff[b+1] -= 1`. We then take the cumulative sum to see how many friends want the number of attendees to be i. If the total number of friends who want the count to be i is >= i -1 (number of friends we could invite), the max friends is i -1\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
