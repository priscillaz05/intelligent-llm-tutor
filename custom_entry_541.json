The goal is to find the number of such partitions and provide one such partition as a binary string.\\n- Identifying Edge Cases and Constraints:  The size of sets A and B are not pre-defined. A must be non-empty. There could be graphs where no such partition exists.  The problem statement specifies no self-loops or duplicate edges.\\n- Choosing an Algorithmic Approach:  The core idea is to identify a set of vertices A that are independent and connected to all other vertices.  One can iterate through all possible subsets of vertices and check if the conditions for set A are met.  However, this approach is inefficient.  A more efficient approach involves identifying potential candidates for set A based on the graph's structure, such as vertices with the same neighbors.\\n- Optimization Strategies: Using adjacency lists or sets to represent the graph efficiently. Employing hashmaps/dictionaries to group vertices with identical neighbor sets can drastically reduce the search space.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the critical conditions for the sets A and B in the vertex partition?\",\n    \"How can the requirement that 'A is an independent set' be checked programmatically, given a graph?\",\n    \"What is the meaning of 'for each vertex a in A and each vertex b in B, there is an edge (a, b) in G', and how can this condition be verified?\",\n    \"How can vertices with identical neighbors be identified and grouped efficiently, and how does this help in finding suitable partitions?\",\n    \"What edge cases should be considered, and how would they affect the outcome of the program?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Set A must be an independent set, non-empty, and every vertex in A must be connected to every vertex in B. Set B must contain all other vertices not in A.\",\n    \"For each pair of vertices in A, there should be no edge between them in the graph. This requires checking all pairs of vertices in A for the absence of a direct edge.\",\n    \"It means that every vertex in A must have a direct edge to every vertex in B.  This needs to be checked for every vertex in A against every vertex in B.\",\n    \"Vertices with identical neighbor sets can be grouped using a hashmap where the key is the frozen set of neighbors, and the value is a list of vertices with those neighbors. This allows for efficient identification and selection of potential set A candidates.\",\n    \"Edge cases include graphs where no such partition exists, graphs where A can only be a single node, or graphs where all nodes can form a potential A. The program should handle these gracefully and output 0 if no suitable partition is found.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
