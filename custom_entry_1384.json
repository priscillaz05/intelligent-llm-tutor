If a word has multiple roots, the shortest root should be used. If a word doesn't have a root in the dictionary, it should remain unchanged.\\n- Choosing an Algorithmic Strategy: A trie data structure can be used for efficient prefix matching. Iterate through the dictionary to build the trie. Then, split the input sentence into words, and for each word, search for the shortest root using the trie.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: If a word does not have any root in the provided dictionary, keep the original word. If multiple roots exist for a successor, select the shortest root.\\n- Implementation Details: The trie will store each character of the root words. A special character, say '#', is used to mark the end of a root word. While searching for roots, the trie is traversed until either a '#' is encountered (meaning a valid root is found) or no further matching characters are available.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do I efficiently determine the shortest root of each word in the sentence given the constraints?\",\n    \"How should I handle the edge case where a word in the sentence does not have any root in the dictionary?\",\n    \"What data structure can I use to store the dictionary of roots for efficient prefix matching?\",\n    \"How do I build and use the trie to find the shortest root for each word in the sentence?\",\n    \"How do I handle cases where a word has multiple roots available in the dictionary?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"I can use a trie data structure for efficient prefix matching and find the shortest root by traversing the trie until a valid root is found or no further characters match.\",\n    \"If a word does not have any root in the dictionary, the original word should be retained without any modifications.\",\n    \"A trie data structure is suitable for this purpose, as it allows efficient prefix-based searching.\",\n    \"To build the trie, insert each root word into the trie. To find the shortest root for a word, traverse the trie using the characters of the word until a root (marked by a special character) is found or no further match is possible. Return the found root if available, otherwise return the original word.\",\n    \"If a word has multiple roots, the trie search will naturally find the shortest root first because the trie is traversed character by character. So, I can simply return the first root found.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
