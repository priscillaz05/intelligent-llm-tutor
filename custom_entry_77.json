Each ant i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) has a strength si.\\n\\nIn order to make his dinner more interesting, Mole organizes a version of \u00abHunger Games\u00bb for the ants. He chooses two numbers l and r (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 n) and each pair of ants with indices between l and r (inclusively) will fight. When two ants i and j fight, ant i gets one battle point only if si divides sj (also, ant j gets one battle point only if sj divides si).\\n\\nAfter all fights have been finished, Mole makes the ranking. An ant i, with vi battle points obtained, is going to be freed only if vi = r - l, or in other words only if it took a point in every fight it participated. After that, Mole eats the rest of the ants. Note that there can be many ants freed or even none.\\n\\nIn order to choose the best sequence, Mole gives you t segments [li, ri] and asks for each of them how many ants is he going to eat if those ants fight.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line contains one integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 105), the size of the ant colony. \\n\\nThe second line contains n integers s1, s2, ..., sn (1 \u2264 si \u2264 109), the strengths of the ants. \\n\\nThe third line contains one integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 105), the number of test cases. \\n\\nEach of the next t lines contains two integers li and ri (1 \u2264 li \u2264 ri \u2264 n), describing one query.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nPrint to the standard output t lines. The i-th line contains number of ants that Mole eats from the segment [li, ri].\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nInput\\n\\n5\\n1 3 2 4 2\\n4\\n1 5\\n2 5\\n3 5\\n4 5\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n4\\n4\\n1\\n1\\n\\nNote\\n\\nIn the first test battle points for each ant are v = [4, 0, 2, 0, 2], so ant number 1 is freed. Mole eats the ants 2, 3, 4, 5.\\n\\nIn the second test case battle points are v = [0, 2, 0, 2], so no ant is freed and all of them are eaten by Mole.\\n\\nIn the third test case battle points are v = [2, 0, 2], so ants number 3 and 5 are freed. Mole eats only the ant 4.\\n\\nIn the fourth test case battle points are v = [0, 1], so ant number 5 is freed. Mole eats the ant 4.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"from math import gcd\\n\\nclass SegTree:\\n\\n\\tdef __init__(self, arr=None, length=None):\\n\\t\\tif arr is not None:\\n\\t\\t\\tself.n = len(arr)\\n\\t\\t\\tself.t = [1 for _ in range(2 * self.n)]\\n\\t\\t\\tself.ct = [0] * self.n + [1] * self.n\\n\\t\\t\\tself.construct(arr)\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tassert False\\n\\t\\t\\tself.n = length\\n\\t\\t\\tself.t = [1 for _ in range(2 * self.n)]\\n\\n\\tdef construct(self, arr):\\n\\t\\tself.t[self.n:] = arr\\n\\t\\tfor i in reversed(range(0, self.n)):\\n\\t\\t\\tself.t[i] = gcd(self.t[i * 2], self.t[i * 2 + 1])\\n\\t\\t\\tif self.t[i] == self.t[i * 2]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tself.ct[i] += self.ct[i * 2]\\n\\t\\t\\tif self.t[i] == self.t[i * 2 + 1]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tself.ct[i] += self.ct[i * 2 + 1]\\n\\n\\tdef modify(self, p, val):\\n\\t\\tp += self.n\\n\\t\\tself.t[p] = val\\n\\t\\tself.ct[p] = 1\\n\\t\\twhile p > 1:\\n\\t\\t\\tself.t[p // 2] = gcd(self.t[p], self.t[p ^ 1])\\n\\t\\t\\tself.ct[p // 2] = 0\\n\\t\\t\\tif self.t[p // 2] == self.t[p]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tself.ct[p // 2] += self.ct[p]\\n\\t\\t\\tif self.t[p // 2] == self.t[p ^ 1]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tself.ct[p // 2] += self.ct[p ^ 1]\\n\\t\\t\\tp //= 2\\n\\n\\tdef gcd_query(self, l, r):\\n\\t\\tl += self.n\\n\\t\\tr += self.n\\n\\t\\tres = self.t[l]\\n\\t\\twhile l < r:\\n\\t\\t\\tif l & 1:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tres = gcd(res, self.t[l])\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tl += 1\\n\\t\\t\\tif r & 1:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tr -= 1\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tres = gcd(res, self.t[r])\\n\\t\\t\\tl //= 2\\n\\t\\t\\tr //= 2\\n\\t\\treturn res\\n\\n\\tdef query_num_eq_gcd(self, l, r):\\n\\t\\tmy_gcd = self.gcd_query(l, r)\\n\\t\\tl += self.n\\n\\t\\tr += self.n\\n\\t\\tres = 0\\n\\t\\twhile l < r:\\n\\t\\t\\tif l & 1:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif self.t[l] == my_gcd:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tres += self.ct[l]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tl += 1\\n\\t\\t\\tif r & 1:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tr -= 1\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif self.t[r] == my_gcd:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tres += self.ct[r]\\n\\t\\t\\tl //= 2\\n\\t\\t\\tr //= 2\\n\\t\\treturn res\\nimport sys\\nn = int(input())\\ns = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\\nst = SegTree(arr=s)\\nt = int(input())\\nfor _ in range(t):\\n\\t(l, r) = [int(x) for x in sys.stdin.readline().split()]\\n\\tprint(r - l + 1 - st.query_num_eq_gcd(l - 1, r))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem describes a scenario where ants with different strengths fight within a given range. An ant wins a fight if its strength divides the opponent's strength. An ant is freed if it wins all its fights within the range, and the goal is to find how many ants are eaten (not freed) for each query range.\\n- Identifying Key Calculations: Determine the battle points for each ant within a given range [l, r]. An ant i's battle points vi is the number of ants j in the range [l, r] such that si divides sj.  An ant is freed if vi = r - l, meaning it won all its fights. The number of eaten ants is then (r - l + 1) - (number of freed ants).\\n- Developing a Strategy: The core idea is to efficiently calculate the number of 'freed' ants within each range [l, r]. A naive approach would result in O(n^2) complexity per query which would timeout.  A more sophisticated data structure approach (like a segment tree with GCD computation) is needed to compute the result efficiently.\\n- Optimizing for Efficiency: Precompute or store intermediate results, and utilize divide and conquer paradigms to reduce the time complexity of each query.\\n- Handling Input/Output: Parse the input to extract the ants' strengths and the queries (l, r).  Process each query and output the number of ants eaten for each of them.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you efficiently compute the number of ants that are 'freed' within a given range [l, r] without iterating through all possible pairs of ants for each query?\",\n    \"What data structure would be appropriate to efficiently determine the greatest common divisor (GCD) of elements within a given range, and how does this GCD relate to determining which ants are 'freed'?\",\n    \"How can you leverage the properties of GCD to optimize the process of finding ants that divide all other ants' strengths within a specific range?\",\n    \"If an ant's strength divides the GCD of all ant strengths within a range, what does this imply about its battle points and whether it will be freed?\",\n    \"How can a segment tree be used to efficiently calculate both the GCD of a range and the count of elements equal to the GCD within that range to solve the problem?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"By pre-computing some values or using an efficient data structure, such as a segment tree, which can provide information about ranges in logarithmic time.\",\n    \"A segment tree is appropriate.

If its strength is equal to the GCD, its battle points will be equal to the range size (r-l) and hence is freed.\",\n    \"A segment tree allows efficient calculation of the GCD for a range, and additionally, the number of elements which equal this GCD. The difference between the range size and the number of elements equal to the GCD gives the answer.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
