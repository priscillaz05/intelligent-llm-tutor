It involves calculating combinations of vowels and consonants from a fixed set (5 vowels and 7 consonants) and then arranging them.\\n- Decomposing the Problem:  The number of ways to choose Y vowels from 5 is given by 5C(Y) = 5! / (Y! * (5-Y)!).  The number of ways to choose X consonants from 7 is given by 7C(X) = 7! / (X! * (7-X)!).  Then, the total number of ways to arrange these X+Y characters is (X+Y)!.  The final answer is the product of these three values: 5C(Y) * 7C(X) * (X+Y)!\\n- Handling Input and Output: The input consists of a number of test cases T, followed by T lines, each with two integers, X and Y. For each test case, the output is the calculated number of words.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls:  Make sure to handle the factorial calculations correctly, especially when X or Y is 0. The ranges of X and Y are such that they do not exceed the available consonant or vowel count.  The number of test cases T is less than 50.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the given constraints for the number of consonants and vowels, and how do they affect the solution?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the number of ways to choose Y vowels from 5 available vowels, and X consonants from 7 available consonants?\",\n    \"Given the selected consonants and vowels, how do you calculate the number of possible arrangements to form a word?\",\n    \"How should the overall result be computed by combining the individual results for vowel selection, consonant selection, and word arrangement?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The number of consonants is less than or equal to 7, and the number of vowels is less than or equal to 5. This constraints the combinations possible and makes calculation feasible since we know total number of vowels and consonents.\",\n    \"The number of ways to choose Y vowels from 5 is given by the combination formula 5C(Y) = 5! / (Y! * (5-Y)!). Similarly, the number of ways to choose X consonants from 7 is given by 7C(X) = 7! / (X! * (7-X)!).\",\n    \"After choosing X consonants and Y vowels, there are a total of X+Y characters.
