Help them obtain the required permutation by paying as little money as possible.\\n\\nMore formally, we have two permutations, p and s of numbers from 1 to n. We can swap p_{i} and p_{j}, by paying |i - j| coins for it. Find and print the smallest number of coins required to obtain permutation s from permutation p. Also print the sequence of swap operations at which we obtain a solution. \\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains a single number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2000) \u2014 the length of the permutations.\\n\\nThe second line contains a sequence of n numbers from 1 to n \u2014 permutation p. Each number from 1 to n occurs exactly once in this line.\\n\\nThe third line contains a sequence of n numbers from 1 to n \u2014 permutation s.

The solution needs to output the minimum cost, the number of swaps, and the sequence of swaps performed.\\n- Data Structures: The solution uses lists (arrays) to represent the permutations and a dictionary to map values in permutation `s` to their indices. This is crucial for efficient lookup during the transformation process.\\n- Algorithm Selection: The algorithm first transforms permutation `p` to a representation relative to permutation `s` using the dictionary. Then it calculates the minimum cost as the sum of the absolute differences between the original and target positions divided by 2. A `while` loop is used to iterate and perform swaps until `p` becomes identical to `s`.\\n- Optimization Techniques: The bitwise right shift operator `>> 1` is used to divide the sum of absolute differences by 2, optimizing the cost calculation. The algorithm iterates and swaps elements in `p` until it matches the target order specified by `s`.\\n- Invariant Maintenance: The inner loop finds pairs `i` and `j` where `a[i] < i` and `a[j] >= i`, ensuring that swapping elements brings the permutation closer to the desired state. The algorithm maintains the invariant that each swap reduces the total cost, ensuring that the final cost is minimal.\\n- Output Generation: The algorithm stores the swaps in list `b`, counts the number of swaps and prints it, then prints each swap operation in the correct format, ensuring the problem requirements for output are met.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can the initial permutations be transformed into a representation that facilitates efficient cost calculation and permutation transformation?\",\n    \"Why is the sum of absolute differences divided by 2 to obtain the minimum cost?\",\n    \"How does the algorithm identify suitable pairs of indices to swap such that the transformation cost is minimized?\",\n    \"What is the role of the `while` loop and the inner `for` loops in achieving the desired permutation transformation?\",\n    \"How are the swap operations stored and outputted in the correct format to meet the problem's output requirements?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The initial permutations can be transformed by mapping the values in permutation `s` to their indices, and then using these indices to represent permutation `p` relative to permutation `s`. This allows for a direct comparison of element positions and facilitates cost calculation and transformation.\",\n    \"The sum of absolute differences is divided by 2 because each swap involves two elements, so each swap contributes to reducing the total difference from both affected indices. Dividing by 2 accounts for this double-counting.\",\n    \"The algorithm identifies suitable pairs of indices to swap by searching for an index `i` where `a[i] < i` and an index `j` (between `a[i]` and `i`) where `a[j] >= i`. Swapping such a pair brings the permutation closer to the desired state by reducing the total cost.\",\n    \"The `while` loop iterates until permutation `p` matches the target order specified by permutation `s`. The inner `for` loops search for suitable pairs of indices to swap. The outer loop ensures all discrepancies are resolved, while the inner loop selects the most cost-effective swaps.\",\n    \"The swap operations are stored in the list `b` as tuples of `(i + 1, j + 1)`, which represent the indices (starting from 1) of the elements to be swapped. The algorithm then prints the length of `b` as the number of swaps, and iterates through `b` to print each swap operation in the required format.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
