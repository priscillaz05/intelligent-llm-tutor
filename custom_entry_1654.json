The task at hand here is a simple one. You need to add two numbers which have been written in reversed arabic and return the output back in reversed arabic form, assuming no zeroes were lost while reversing.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\nThe input consists of N cases. The first line of the input contains only a positive integer N. Then follow the cases. Each case consists of exactly one line with two positive integers seperated by space. These are the reversednumbers you are to add.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\nFor each case, print exactly one line containing only one integer- the reversed sum of two reversed numbers. Omit any leading zeroes in the output.\\n\\n\\n-----Example-----\\nInput:\\n1\\n24 1\\n\\nOutput:\\n34\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"n = int(input())\\nfor index in range(0, n):\\n\\t(a, b) = list(map(str, input().split()))\\n\\ta = int(a[::-1])\\n\\tb = int(b[::-1])\\n\\ta = str(a + b)\\n\\ta = int(a[::-1])\\n\\tprint(a)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires reading two reversed numbers, adding them, and returning the reversed representation of the sum, omitting leading zeros.\\n- Planning the Solution:  The numbers must be reversed to their original form, added, and then the sum must be reversed back. Ensure leading zeros are handled during the final reverse.\\n- Implementing the Solution: Read the number of test cases, then iterate through each case. For each case, read the two numbers as strings, reverse them, convert them to integers, sum them, convert the sum to a string, reverse the string, and convert it to an integer to remove any leading zeros before printing the result.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you handle multiple test cases from the input?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently reverse a string in Python?\",\n    \"Why is it important to convert the reversed sum back to an integer before printing?\",\n    \"What data type should be used for initial input and intermediate calculations, and why?\",\n    \"What steps are crucial to avoid errors such as incorrect input parsing?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Read the first line to determine the number of test cases, then use a loop to process each test case individually.\",\n    \"You can efficiently reverse a string using slicing: string[::-1].\",\n    \"Converting the reversed sum to an integer removes any leading zeros that might be present after reversing the string representation of the sum.\",\n    \"The input numbers should be read as strings initially to easily reverse them. Intermediate calculations are done with integers for addition. The final result should be a string to allow for reversal before converting back to an integer for output.\",\n    \"Ensure correct input parsing by using map and split to separate the numbers and handle string conversions carefully.
