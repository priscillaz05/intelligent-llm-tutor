Alice immediately took an orange for herself, Bob took an apple. To make the process of sharing the remaining fruit more fun, the friends decided to play a game. They put multiple cards and on each one they wrote a letter, either 'A', or the letter 'B'. Then they began to remove the cards one by one from left to right, every time they removed a card with the letter 'A', Alice gave Bob all the fruits she had at that moment and took out of the bag as many apples and as many oranges as she had before. Thus the number of oranges and apples Alice had, did not change. If the card had written letter 'B', then Bob did the same, that is, he gave Alice all the fruit that he had, and took from the bag the same set of fruit. After the last card way removed, all the fruit in the bag were over.\\n\\nYou know how many oranges and apples was in the bag at first. Your task is to find any sequence of cards that Alice and Bob could have played with.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line of the input contains two integers, x, y (1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 1018, xy > 1) \u2014 the number of oranges and apples that were initially in the bag.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nPrint any sequence of cards that would meet the problem conditions as a compressed string of characters 'A' and 'B. That means that you need to replace the segments of identical consecutive characters by the number of repetitions of the characters and the actual character. For example, string AAABAABBB should be replaced by string 3A1B2A3B, but cannot be replaced by 2A1A1B2A3B or by 3AB2A3B. See the samples for clarifications of the output format. The string that you print should consist of at most 106 characters. It is guaranteed that if the answer exists, its compressed representation exists, consisting of at most 106 characters. If there are several possible answers, you are allowed to print any of them.\\n\\nIf the sequence of cards that meet the problem statement does not not exist, print a single word Impossible.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nInput\\n\\n1 4\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n3B\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n2 2\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nImpossible\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n3 2\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n1A1B\\n\\nNote\\n\\nIn the first sample, if the row contained three cards with letter 'B', then Bob should give one apple to Alice three times. So, in the end of the game Alice has one orange and three apples, and Bob has one apple, in total it is one orange and four apples.\\n\\nIn second sample, there is no answer since one card is not enough for game to finish, and two cards will produce at least three apples or three oranges.\\n\\nIn the third sample, cards contain letters 'AB', so after removing the first card Bob has one orange and one apple, and after removal of second card Alice has two oranges and one apple. So, in total it is three oranges and two apples.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def gcd(x, y):\\n\\twhile y > 0:\\n\\t\\t(x, y) = (y, x % y)\\n\\treturn x\\n(x, y) = map(int, input().split())\\nif gcd(x, y) != 1:\\n\\tprint('Impossible')\\n\\texit(0)\\nres = ''\\nwhile x > 0 and y > 0:\\n\\tif y > x:\\n\\t\\tif x == 1:\\n\\t\\t\\ty -= 1\\n\\t\\tres = res + str(y // x) + 'B'\\n\\t\\ty = y % x\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tif y == 1:\\n\\t\\t\\tx -= 1\\n\\t\\tres = res + str(x // y) + 'A'\\n\\t\\tx = x % y\\nprint(res)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem describes a game between Alice and Bob involving oranges, apples, and cards labeled 'A' or 'B'. The goal is to determine a sequence of cards that would result in all the fruit being distributed, given the initial number of oranges and apples.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints: The number of oranges and apples is given as input. The cards determine who gives fruit to whom, and how many fruits are added to the giver's stock after giving away. The output needs to be a compressed string representing the card sequence, and the solution must print \\\"Impossible\\\" if no such sequence exists.\\n- Devising a Solution Strategy: The problem can be solved by relating it to the Euclidean algorithm for finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD). The game can be visualized as reducing the numbers of oranges and apples towards zero. Each card 'A' corresponds to reducing the number of oranges, and each card 'B' to reducing the number of apples. The GCD of the initial numbers must be 1 for a solution to exist.\\n- Algorithm Implementation: Check if the GCD of x and y is 1. If not, print \\\"Impossible\\\". If yes, construct the sequence of cards by repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger, similar to the Euclidean algorithm. The number of subtractions before switching to the other number determines the number of consecutive 'A's or 'B's. Output the compressed string.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the significance of the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the initial numbers of oranges and apples in determining whether a solution exists?\",\n    \"How does the Euclidean algorithm relate to finding the sequence of cards in this game?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases or conditions under which no solution is possible, and how would you handle them?\",\n    \"Can you explain the process of constructing the compressed string from the sequence of card letters ('A' or 'B')?\",\n    \"How do you simulate the actions of Alice and Bob during the game to verify if a generated sequence of cards is correct?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"If the GCD of the initial numbers of oranges and apples is not 1, then it's impossible to find a sequence of cards that will result in both numbers becoming zero. This is because the game essentially reduces both numbers, and if they have a common divisor greater than 1, that divisor will always remain.\",\n    \"The Euclidean algorithm provides a method to reduce two numbers to their GCD by repeatedly subtracting the smaller from the larger. In this problem, each subtraction corresponds to a card 'A' or 'B', depending on whether we're reducing the number of oranges or apples. The sequence of subtractions can be translated to the sequence of cards.\",\n    \"One edge case is when the GCD of the initial numbers is not 1. Another is when either the number of oranges or apples is zero initially. If either of these cases occurs, then you print 'Impossible'. Also, at least one of the initial numbers must be greater than zero.\",\n    \"The compressed string represents the sequence of cards by grouping consecutive identical cards and representing each group with its length and the card letter. For example, 'AAABAABBB' becomes '3A1B2A3B'.\",\n    \"To simulate the actions, you iterate through the generated card sequence, updating the number of oranges and apples Alice and Bob possess, following the game rules specified in the problem statement. After processing all cards, you can check if both the number of oranges and apples are distributed completely.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
