Now the R2 laboratory is testing one of the R1 processors.\\n\\nThe testing goes in n steps, at each step the processor gets some instructions, and then its temperature is measured. The head engineer in R2 is keeping a report record on the work of the processor: he writes down the minimum and the maximum measured temperature in his notebook. His assistant had to write down all temperatures into his notebook, but (for unknown reasons) he recorded only m.\\n\\nThe next day, the engineer's assistant filed in a report with all the m temperatures. However, the chief engineer doubts that the assistant wrote down everything correctly (naturally, the chief engineer doesn't doubt his notes). So he asked you to help him. Given numbers n, m, min, max and the list of m temperatures determine whether you can upgrade the set of m temperatures to the set of n temperatures (that is add n - m temperatures), so that the minimum temperature was min and the maximum one was max.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains four integers n, m, min, max (1 \u2264 m < n \u2264 100;\u00a01 \u2264 min < max \u2264 100). The second line contains m space-separated integers t_{i} (1 \u2264 t_{i} \u2264 100) \u2014 the temperatures reported by the assistant.\\n\\nNote, that the reported temperatures, and the temperatures you want to add can contain equal temperatures.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nIf the data is consistent, print 'Correct' (without the quotes). Otherwise, print 'Incorrect' (without the quotes).\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n2 1 1 2\\n1\\n\\nOutput\\nCorrect\\n\\nInput\\n3 1 1 3\\n2\\n\\nOutput\\nCorrect\\n\\nInput\\n2 1 1 3\\n2\\n\\nOutput\\nIncorrect\\n\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first test sample one of the possible initial configurations of temperatures is [1, 2].\\n\\nIn the second test sample one of the possible initial configurations of temperatures is [2, 1, 3].\\n\\nIn the third test sample it is impossible to add one temperature to obtain the minimum equal to 1 and the maximum equal to 3.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import re\\nimport inspect\\nfrom sys import argv, exit\\n\\ndef rstr():\\n\\treturn input()\\n\\ndef rstrs(splitchar=' '):\\n\\treturn [i for i in input().split(splitchar)]\\n\\ndef rint():\\n\\treturn int(input())\\n\\ndef rints(splitchar=' '):\\n\\treturn [int(i) for i in rstrs(splitchar)]\\n\\ndef varnames(obj, namespace=globals()):\\n\\treturn [name for name in namespace if namespace[name] is obj]\\n\\ndef pvar(var, override=False):\\n\\tprnt(varnames(var), var)\\n\\ndef prnt(*args, override=False):\\n\\tif '-v' in argv or override:\\n\\t\\tprint(*args)\\npq = []\\n\\ndef penq(s):\\n\\tif not isinstance(s, str):\\n\\t\\ts = str(s)\\n\\tpq.append(s)\\n\\ndef pdump():\\n\\ts = '\\\\n'.join(pq).encode()\\n\\tos.write(1, s)\\n\\ndef __starting_point():\\n\\t(timesteps, ast, mn, mx) = rints()\\n\\tto_add = timesteps - ast\\n\\tasts = rints()\\n\\tfor t in asts:\\n\\t\\tif t < mn or t > mx:\\n\\t\\t\\tprint('Incorrect')\\n\\t\\t\\treturn\\n\\tif mn not in asts:\\n\\t\\tif to_add == 0:\\n\\t\\t\\tprint('Incorrect')\\n\\t\\t\\treturn\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tto_add -= 1\\n\\tif mx not in asts:\\n\\t\\tif to_add == 0:\\n\\t\\t\\tprint('Incorrect')\\n\\t\\t\\treturn\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tto_add -= 1\\n\\tprint('Correct')\\n__starting_point()\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The goal is to determine if a given list of temperatures can be extended to match a required minimum and maximum, given a constraint on the total number of temperatures.\\n- Identifying Constraints: The number of temperatures to add is limited by `n - m`.  The added temperatures must allow the minimum and maximum temperatures to be `min` and `max` respectively.\\n- Edge Cases: If any of the provided temperatures are outside the range `[min, max]`, the result is 'Incorrect'.  Also, if either `min` or `max` are not present in the provided temperatures and we have no more temperatures to add (`n - m == 0`), the result is 'Incorrect'.\\n- Algorithmic Approach: First, check if any given temperature is outside the allowed range. Then check if min and max values are present within the given temperatures. If they are not present, check the number of available additional temperatures. Print 'Correct' if all criteria are satisfied; otherwise, print 'Incorrect'.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the input parameters, and what do they represent?\",\n    \"What are the key constraints for adding new temperature values?\",\n    \"What conditions would immediately make the data 'Incorrect'?\",\n    \"How does the number of temperatures to add (n-m) influence the correctness of the data?\",\n    \"What is the step-by-step process for determining if the data is consistent?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The input consists of four integers: `n` (total temperatures), `m` (provided temperatures), `min` (minimum temperature), `max` (maximum temperature), and a list of `m` integers representing the provided temperatures.\",\n    \"The new temperatures should allow for the minimum temperature to be `min` and the maximum to be `max`. The number of additional temperatures is limited by `n - m`.\",\n    \"If any of the provided temperatures are less than `min` or greater than `max`, or if the values `min` or `max` are not in the provided temperatures and `n - m` is zero, then the data is 'Incorrect'.\",\n    \"If `n - m` is zero, we cannot add any temperatures, so both `min` and `max` MUST be present in the initially provided `m` temperatures. If `n - m` is greater than zero, we can add temperatures. If `min` or `max` are missing in the input temperatures, we must check if (n - m) > 0. if (n-m) > 0 we decrement the number of temperatures to add.\",\n    \"1. Check if any provided temperature is out of range (`min` to `max`). If so, output 'Incorrect'. 2. Check if `min` is present in the provided temperatures. If not, check if `n - m > 0`. If not output 'Incorrect', else decrement `n - m` by 1. 3. Repeat for `max`. 4. If after the checks above, we haven't outputted 'Incorrect', then output 'Correct'.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
