If such an element exists, print it; otherwise, print -1. We need to consider multiple test cases.\\n- Data Structures: Using a dictionary (hash map) is appropriate for counting occurrences of each element. This allows for efficient lookups and updates of the element counts.\\n- Algorithm: For each test case, iterate through the input array, updating the count of each element in the dictionary. If any element's count reaches 3 or more, store that element and break the loop, then print result. If the loop completes without finding any element with a count of 3 or more, print -1.\\n- Edge Cases: Consider the case where the array has fewer than three elements; in such cases, no element can appear three times, so the output should be -1. The constraints specify array size limits and integer ranges, so no overflow issues need to be considered.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the most efficient data structure to use for counting element occurrences in this problem and why?\",\n    \"How should the code handle multiple test cases, and what should be printed for each?\",\n    \"What is the optimal point in the code to check if an element appears at least three times to improve efficiency?\",\n    \"What value should be returned if no element appears at least three times in the array?\",\n    \"Are there any potential concerns regarding input size or data types that could lead to runtime errors, and how can these be addressed?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A dictionary (hash map) is most efficient because it provides O(1) average time complexity for element lookup and updates.\",\n    \"The code should iterate through each test case.
