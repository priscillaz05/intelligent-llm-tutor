Non-alphabetic characters should remain unchanged. Capitalization must be preserved.\\n- Handling Wrap-Around: Determine how to handle 'z' and 'Z' so they wrap around to 'a' and 'A' respectively.\\n- Preserving Capitalization: Ensure that capital letters are shifted correctly and remain capitalized.\\n- Handling Non-alphabetic Characters: Make sure spaces and special characters are not altered.\\n- Assembling the Solution: Build a string by transforming each character individually, using conditional logic to handle different types of characters.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you handle the letters 'z' and 'Z' to wrap around to 'a' and 'A' respectively, while preserving the case?\",\n    \"How would you determine if a character is an alphabet and change it to the next alphabet?\",\n    \"How do you ensure that only letters are transformed and other characters like spaces and special symbols are not altered?\",\n    \"How do you ensure that capital letters stay capital letters when they are incremented?\",\n    \"What is the most efficient way to construct the final string after modifying each individual character?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"For 'z' and 'Z', I need to reset to 'a' and 'A'. This can be done by checking if the character is 'z' or 'Z', and if so, shifting it back to 'a' or 'A'.\",\n    \"I can use the `isalpha()` method to check if a character is an alphabet. If it is, I'll find its ASCII value, increment it by one, and convert the new ASCII value back to a character.\",\n    \"I can use an `if` condition within the loop that processes each character to only apply the shifting logic if `isalpha()` returns `True`. Otherwise, the character will remain the same.\",\n    \"Before incrementing the character, I should check if the character is uppercase using `isupper()`. If it is, the shifted character needs to remain uppercase by properly wrapping around 'Z' to 'A'\",\n    \"I can build the string using a list comprehension, and then join the elements of the list together using `''`.join() to get the final modified string.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
