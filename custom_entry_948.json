Each move involves choosing a factor 'c' (> 1) of 'a' or 'b' and dividing that number by 'c'.\\n- Edge Cases and Constraints: Consider cases where a == b. If a == b, then if k == 1, output should be NO. If k > 0 and a == b output should be YES.\\n- Factoring Approach: The number of moves corresponds to the number of prime factors of a and b. Calculate the total number of prime factors of a and b.\\n- Determining Possibility: Compare the value of k with the calculated number of prime factors. The problem can be solved only if k is less than or equal to this number and k is at least 1 or 2 depending on whether a==b or not. Consider the case where either a or b is 1, and k is 1, output should be YES.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the minimum number of operations required to make 'a' equal to 'b', and how does this relate to the prime factorization of 'a' and 'b'?\",\n    \"If a and b are equal, what are the conditions for determining if it's possible to make them equal in 'k' turns?\",\n    \"How should you handle edge cases such as when a = 1 or b = 1, or when either 'a' or 'b' is 1?\",\n    \"Given the constraints on 'a', 'b', and 'k', what range of 'k' values could potentially lead to a 'Yes' output?\",\n    \"What pre-processing steps can be performed to optimize the calculation of the number of turns required?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The minimum number of operations is related to the number of prime factors of a and b. The number of moves necessary to make a and b equal is the sum of the number of prime factors of a and the number of prime factors of b.\",\n    \"If a and b are equal and k = 1 then the result is NO. If a and b are equal and k > 1 then the result is NO if k is greater than the number of prime factors of a and b together and YES otherwise.\",\n    \"If either a or b is 1, you need to consider the case for when k equals 1. Otherwise, if a is 1 and b is 1 and k is 1, the answer is NO.\",\n    \"Because a and b are only divisible by numbers greater than 1, the min number of turns needed is 1.
