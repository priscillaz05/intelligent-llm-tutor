N can be up to 10^5, and K can be up to 10^10, which means the sum of a subsequence can be large. This might require using 64-bit integers to store intermediate sums.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Consider using a sliding window approach to efficiently calculate the sum of contiguous subsequences. Iterate through the array using two pointers, `l` and `r`, representing the left and right boundaries of the current subsequence.  When the current sum meets the condition, increment the count and shrink the window from the left.\\n- Optimizing for Efficiency: Avoid redundant calculations by maintaining a running sum of the subsequence. When the sum is at least K, we know that any subsequence that starts at l and extends to any element after r also satisfies the condition, hence we can add N - r to our answer.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is a contiguous subsequence, and how is it different from a general subsequence?\",\n    \"Given that K can be up to 10^10 and N can be up to 10^5, what data type should you use to store the sum of subsequences to avoid overflow?\",\n    \"How does the sliding window technique help in efficiently calculating the sum of contiguous subsequences?\",\n    \"When the sum of the current subsequence is at least K, how can we efficiently count all valid subsequences that include the current left boundary?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases that need to be considered, and how should they be handled?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A contiguous subsequence is a sequence of elements that are adjacent in the original sequence.  Unlike a general subsequence, elements must be consecutive.\",\n    \"Since the maximum value of an element is 10^5, and N can be up to 10^5, the sum of the subsequence can reach 10^10. Therefore, a 64-bit integer type (long long in C++, long in Python) should be used.\",\n    \"The sliding window technique helps avoid redundant calculations by maintaining a running sum as the window slides through the array. This avoids recalculating the entire sum for each possible subsequence.\",\n    \"When the current sum is at least K, we know that all subsequences starting from `l` and ending at any index from `r` to `N-1` will also have a sum at least K. Therefore, we add `N - r` to the count.\",\n    \"Edge cases include an empty input array. Also, if the entire array sum is less than K, then the result should be 0.
