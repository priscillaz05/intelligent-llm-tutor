A complete binary tree has all levels filled except possibly the last, which is filled from left to right. The goal is to achieve a time complexity better than O(n), implying that we should avoid traversing every node.\\n- Leveraging Complete Tree Properties: A complete binary tree's structure allows us to determine its height efficiently by traversing only the leftmost and rightmost paths.  The height can be used to determine the number of nodes in a full binary tree.\\n- Designing an Efficient Algorithm: Use binary search on the last level to identify where the nodes stop being present. A key observation is to determine the height of the tree and then use the properties of complete binary trees to find the last node in the last level. Then determine the total number of nodes.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Recursively determine the height of the left and right subtrees. If they are equal, the left subtree is a complete full binary tree. Otherwise, the right subtree is a complete full binary tree. Use this to get the total number of nodes.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What properties of a complete binary tree can be exploited to count the nodes more efficiently than O(n)?\",\n    \"How can the height of the tree be determined efficiently?\",\n    \"How does knowing that the tree is complete simplify identifying the number of nodes in the tree?\",\n    \"If the height of the left and right subtrees are the same, what does that imply?\",\n    \"If the height of the left and right subtrees differ, what does that imply?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The main property to exploit is the defined structure where all levels are filled except possibly the last one.
