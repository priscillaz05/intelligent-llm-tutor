Check if any occurrence of \\\"AB\\\" is non-overlapping with any occurrence of \\\"BA\\\". Non-overlapping implies that the absolute difference between indices of the substrings should be greater than 1.\\n- Handle edge cases: Consider the cases where either \\\"AB\\\" or \\\"BA\\\" (or both) are not present in the string. In such cases, the answer is \\\"NO\\\".\\n- Implement the solution: Use the `find()` and `rfind()` to search for the substring index, and check to ensure non-overlapping conditions by verifying the absolute difference of the index locations.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the key conditions to satisfy for a string to return \\\"YES\\\"?\",\n    \"How can you determine if two substrings are overlapping in a given string?\",\n    \"What should be the output if either \\\"AB\\\" or \\\"BA\\\" (or both) is not found in the string?\",\n    \"How can you use string methods to efficiently find the substrings \\\"AB\\\" and \\\"BA\\\"?\",\n    \"Are there any edge cases you should be careful about?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The key conditions are that the string must contain both \\\"AB\\\" and \\\"BA\\\" as non-overlapping substrings.\",\n    \"Two substrings are overlapping if the absolute difference between their starting indices is less than or equal to 1.\",\n    \"If either \\\"AB\\\" or \\\"BA\\\" (or both) are not found, the output should be \\\"NO\\\".\",\n    \"You can use `find()` to find the first occurrence and `rfind()` to find the last occurrence of the substrings.\",\n    \"Yes, edge cases include empty strings, strings that do not contain either 'AB' or 'BA', and cases where the substrings are present but overlap.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
