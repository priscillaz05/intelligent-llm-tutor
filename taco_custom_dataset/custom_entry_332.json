"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"The tram in Berland goes along a straight line from the point 0 to the point s and back, passing 1 meter per t_1 seconds in both directions. It means that the tram is always in the state of uniform rectilinear motion, instantly turning around at points x = 0 and x = s.\\n\\nIgor is at the point x_1. He should reach the point x_2. Igor passes 1 meter per t_2 seconds. \\n\\nYour task is to determine the minimum time Igor needs to get from the point x_1 to the point x_2, if it is known where the tram is and in what direction it goes at the moment Igor comes to the point x_1.\\n\\nIgor can enter the tram unlimited number of times at any moment when his and the tram's positions coincide. It is not obligatory that points in which Igor enter and exit the tram are integers. Assume that any boarding and unboarding happens instantly. Igor can move arbitrary along the line (but not faster than 1 meter per t_2 seconds). He can also stand at some point for some time.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains three integers s, x_1 and x_2 (2 \u2264 s \u2264 1000, 0 \u2264 x_1, x_2 \u2264 s, x_1 \u2260 x_2)\\u00a0\u2014 the maximum coordinate of the point to which the tram goes, the point Igor is at, and the point he should come to.\\n\\nThe second line contains two integers t_1 and t_2 (1 \u2264 t_1, t_2 \u2264 1000)\\u00a0\u2014 the time in seconds in which the tram passes 1 meter and the time in seconds in which Igor passes 1 meter.\\n\\nThe third line contains two integers p and d (1 \u2264 p \u2264 s - 1, d is either 1 or $- 1$)\\u00a0\u2014 the position of the tram in the moment Igor came to the point x_1 and the direction of the tram at this moment. If $d = - 1$, the tram goes in the direction from the point s to the point 0. If d = 1, the tram goes in the direction from the point 0 to the point s.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nPrint the minimum time in seconds which Igor needs to get from the point x_1 to the point x_2.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n4 2 4\\n3 4\\n1 1\\n\\nOutput\\n8\\n\\nInput\\n5 4 0\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n\\nOutput\\n7\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first example it is profitable for Igor to go by foot and not to wait the tram. Thus, he has to pass 2 meters and it takes 8 seconds in total, because he passes 1 meter per 4 seconds. \\n\\nIn the second example Igor can, for example, go towards the point x_2 and get to the point 1 in 6 seconds (because he has to pass 3 meters, but he passes 1 meters per 2 seconds). At that moment the tram will be at the point 1, so Igor can enter the tram and pass 1 meter in 1 second. Thus, Igor will reach the point x_2 in 7 seconds in total.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"(s, x1, x2) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\\n(t1, t2) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\\n(p, d) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\\ndi = (x2 - x1 > 0) * 2 - 1\\nti = abs(x2 - x1) * t2\\nif d == di:\\n\\tif (p - x1) * d <= 0:\\n\\t\\ttt = (x2 - p) * d * t1\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\ttt = (2 * s + (x2 - p) * d) * t1\\nelif d == 1:\\n\\ttt = (2 * s - (p + x2)) * t1\\nelse:\\n\\ttt = (p + x2) * t1\\nprint(min(ti, tt))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Read and parse input values for s, x1, x2, t1, t2, p, and d.\\n- Calculate the time it takes for Igor to walk from x1 to x2.\\n- Calculate the time it takes for the tram to reach x2 from its current position p, considering its direction d.\\n- Determine the direction Igor needs to walk: di = (x2 - x1 > 0) * 2 - 1.
