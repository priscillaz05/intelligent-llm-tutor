"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"# The Invitation\\n\\nMost of us played with toy blocks growing up. It was fun and you learned stuff. So what else can you do but rise to the challenge when a 3-year old exclaims, \\\"Look, I made a square!\\\", then pointing to a pile of blocks, \\\"Can _you_ do it?\\\"\\n\\n# These Blocks\\n\\nJust to play along, of course we'll be viewing these blocks in two dimensions. Depth now being disregarded, it turns out the pile has four different sizes of block: `1x1`, `1x2`, `1x3`, and `1x4`. The smallest one represents the area of a square, the other three are rectangular, and all differ by their width. Integers matching these four widths are used to represent the blocks in the input.\\n\\n# This Square\\n\\nWell, the kid made a `4x4` square from this pile, so you'll have to match that. Noticing the way they fit together, you realize the structure must be built in fours rows, one row at a time, where the blocks must be placed horizontally. With the known types of block, there are five types of row you could build:\\n\\n* 1 four-unit block\\n* 1 three-unit block plus 1 one-unit bock (in either order)\\n* 2 two-unit blocks\\n* 1 two-unit block plus 2 one-unit blocks (in any order)\\n* 4 one-unit blocks\\n\\nAmounts for all four of the block sizes in the pile will each vary from `0` to `16`. The total size of the pile will also vary from `0` to `16`. The order of rows is irrelevant. A valid square doesn't have to use up all the given blocks.\\n\\n# Some Examples\\n\\nGiven `1, 3, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 2` there are many ways you could construct a square. Here are three possibilities, as described by their four rows:\\n\\n* 1 four-unit block\\n* 2 two-unit blocks\\n* 1 four-unit block\\n* 4 one-unit blocks\\n>\\n* 1 three-unit block plus 1 one-unit block\\n* 2 two-unit blocks\\n* 1 four-unit block\\n* 1 one-unit block plus 1 three-unit block\\n>\\n* 2 two-unit blocks\\n* 1 three-unit block plus 1 one-unit block\\n* 1 four-unit block\\n* 2 one-unit blocks plus 1 two-unit block\\n>\\n\\nGiven `1, 3, 2, 4, 3, 3, 2` there is no way to complete the task, as you could only build three rows of the correct length. The kid will not be impressed.\\n\\n* 2 two-unit blocks\\n* 1 three-unit block plus 1 one-unit block\\n* 1 four-unit block\\n* (here only sadness)\\n>\\n\\n# Input\\n```python\\nblocks ~ a random list of integers (1 <= x <= 4)\\n```\\n# Output\\n```python\\nTrue or False ~ whether you can build a square\\n```\\n# Enjoy!\\n\\nIf interested, I also have [this kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5cb7baa989b1c50014a53333) as well as [this other kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5cb5eb1f03c3ff4778402099) to consider solving.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def build_square(blocks):\\n\\tfor x in range(4):\\n\\t\\tif 4 in blocks:\\n\\t\\t\\tblocks.remove(4)\\n\\t\\telif 3 in blocks and 1 in blocks:\\n\\t\\t\\tblocks.remove(3)\\n\\t\\t\\tblocks.remove(1)\\n\\t\\telif blocks.count(2) >= 2:\\n\\t\\t\\tblocks.remove(2)\\n\\t\\t\\tblocks.remove(2)\\n\\t\\telif 2 in blocks and blocks.count(1) >= 2:\\n\\t\\t\\tblocks.remove(2)\\n\\t\\t\\tblocks.remove(1)\\n\\t\\t\\tblocks.remove(1)\\n\\t\\telif blocks.count(1) >= 4:\\n\\t\\t\\tblocks.remove(1)\\n\\t\\t\\tblocks.remove(1)\\n\\t\\t\\tblocks.remove(1)\\n\\t\\t\\tblocks.remove(1)\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\treturn False\\n\\treturn True\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem is to determine whether a 4x4 square can be built from a given list of blocks of sizes 1x1, 1x2, 1x3, and 1x4. A square is built row by row, and each row must have a total width of 4. The order of rows doesn't matter.\\n- Identifying Possible Row Configurations: There are five possible row configurations: a block of size 4, a block of size 3 and a block of size 1, two blocks of size 2, a block of size 2 and two blocks of size 1, or four blocks of size 1.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: The solution should attempt to build the square row by row. For each row, it should check if there are sufficient blocks to construct any of the valid row configurations. If a valid configuration is found, the corresponding blocks should be 'removed' from the available blocks, and the process repeats. If after attempting to build four rows, the algorithm succeeds, it should return `True`. If at any point, a valid row configuration cannot be built, the algorithm should return `False`.\\n- Implementation Considerations: The blocks can be simulated as a list of integers. When removing a block, the integer representing the size of the block must be removed from the list. The count method is useful for determining if enough blocks of the required size are present.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you represent the blocks and the different row configurations in the code?\",\n    \"How do you simulate the 'removal' of blocks when constructing a row?\",\n    \"What data structure is best suited for tracking the available blocks, considering the need for both checking the existence and removing elements?\",\n    \"What are the different possible row configurations, and how do you ensure all are considered?\",\n    \"When should the algorithm return True, and when should it return False?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The blocks can be represented by a list of integers, where each integer represents the size of a block (1, 2, 3, or 4). The different row configurations can be represented as specific combinations of these integers that sum up to 4.\",\n    \"The 'removal' of blocks can be simulated by removing the corresponding integer from the blocks list. Use the `remove()` or `count()` methods to handle block removal.\",\n    \"A list data structure is suitable for tracking available blocks. Its methods `remove` and `count` are appropriate for the logic of the problem.\",\n    \"The possible row configurations are: 1 four-unit block, 1 three-unit block plus 1 one-unit block, 2 two-unit blocks, 1 two-unit block plus 2 one-unit blocks, and 4 one-unit blocks. The solution should check for each of these configurations in a specific order.\",\n    \"The algorithm should return `True` if it is able to build four valid rows using the available blocks. It should return `False` if, at any point, it's impossible to build a valid row due to insufficient blocks.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
