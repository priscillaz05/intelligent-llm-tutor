A beautiful rectangle is defined as one where all values in each row and each column are different.\\n- Counting the occurrences: Count the occurrences of each number in the input array. This information is essential for determining the dimensions and content of the rectangle.\\n- Determining rectangle dimensions: Iterate through possible rectangle heights to find the maximum possible area that satisfies the beautiful rectangle conditions. Use accumulated counts of values to optimize area calculation.\\n- Constructing the rectangle: Create the rectangle with the determined dimensions. Populate the rectangle with the input numbers while ensuring the beautiful property is maintained (i.e., no duplicate values in the same row or column). Sort the numbers by their count to efficiently populate the rectangle. Fill the matrix by placing more frequent numbers with appropriate spacing to maintain distinctness in rows and columns.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the key characteristics of a 'beautiful rectangle,' and how do they constrain the solution?\",\n    \"How does the count of each distinct number in the input influence the dimensions of the largest possible beautiful rectangle?\",\n    \"Given the dimensions of the rectangle, how can we populate it with numbers to ensure that it remains 'beautiful'?\",\n    \"How should the code prioritize choosing numbers to populate the rectangle to maximize its size, given that we can choose only a subset of the original numbers?\",\n    \"What strategies can be employed to efficiently track and place numbers into the matrix to avoid violating the beautiful rectangle properties during construction?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A 'beautiful rectangle' has all distinct values in each row and each column. This constraint limits the number of times a particular value can appear in each row and column.\",\n    \"The count of each number determines how many times it can be used in the rectangle. If a number appears fewer times than the height or width of the rectangle, it cannot fill the entire rectangle. The maximum possible dimensions of the rectangle are influenced by these counts.\",\n    \"We can populate the rectangle by iterating through each cell and choosing a number that hasn't been used in the same row or column. A systematic placement, prioritizing frequently occurring elements, can help maintain the 'beautiful' property.\",\n    \"The code should prioritize choosing numbers with the highest counts, as these are more likely to fill the rectangle effectively. Sorting the numbers by their counts is beneficial.\",\n    \"To efficiently track and place numbers, we can maintain flags or sets for each row and column to indicate which numbers have already been used. When choosing a number for a cell, check if it's already present in the row or column. By placing numbers at offsets of row/column length we are also able to achieve distinct rows and columns.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
