On the occasion of the city's anniversary, a decision was taken to pave the Square with square granite flagstones. Each flagstone is of the size a\u2009\u00d7\u2009a.\\n\\nWhat is the least number of flagstones needed to pave the Square? It's allowed to cover the surface larger than the Times Square, but the Square has to be covered. It's not allowed to break the flagstones. The sides of flagstones should be parallel to the sides of the Square.\\nInput\\n\\nThe input contains three positive integer numbers in the first line: n,\u2009\u2009m and a (1\u2009\u2264\u2009\u2009n,\u2009m,\u2009a\u2009\u2264\u2009109).\\nOutput\\n\\nWrite the needed number of flagstones.\\n\\nSAMPLE INPUT\\n6 6 4\\n\\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\\n4\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def ceiling(n,a):\\n\\tdiv=n/a\\n\\tres=n%a\\n\\tif res!=0:\\n\\t\\tdiv+=1\\n\\treturn int(div)\\n\\t\\t\\nin1=input()\\nlst=in1.split()\\nn=int(lst[0])\\nm=int(lst[1])\\na=int(lst[2])\\nnum1=ceiling(n,a)\\nnum2=ceiling(m,a)\\nprint(num1*num2) ### ofc! multiply\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: Recognize the problem requires finding the minimum number of square flagstones (a x a) to cover a rectangular area (n x m). Note that flagstones cannot be broken and can cover beyond the area.\\n- Identifying the Core Calculation: Realize that the number of flagstones needed in each dimension (n and m) is determined by dividing the dimension's length by the flagstone's side length (a) and rounding up to the nearest whole number.\\n- Defining the Ceiling Function: Implement a ceiling function that takes two arguments (dimension length and flagstone side length) and returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the result of the division.\\n- Computing the Required Flagstones: Calculate the number of flagstones needed for each dimension using the ceiling function and then multiply these two numbers to determine the total number of required flagstones.\\n- Handling Input: Read the input values of n, m, and a from the console, convert them to integers, and then perform the calculations.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the key mathematical operation needed to determine how many flagstones are required to cover a given dimension?\",\n    \"How does the constraint that flagstones cannot be broken affect the calculation, and how do you deal with it?\",\n    \"Can you express the overall number of flagstones in terms of the results of the ceiling operations on the dimensions n and m, with flagstone side a?\",\n    \"What steps are involved to read the input and perform the calculation using code?\",\n    \"How should you handle the remainder when dividing a dimension by the flagstone size to ensure full coverage?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The key operation is division of the dimension's length by the flagstone's side length.\",\n    \"Because flagstones can't be broken, you need to round up to the nearest whole number of flagstones. You need to apply the ceiling function.\",\n    \"The total number of flagstones is the product of ceiling(n/a) and ceiling(m/a).\",\n    \"First, you read the input values for n, m, and a. Then, convert them to integers. After that, calculate the ceiling values for both dimensions. Finally, multiply these values and print the final result.\",\n    \"To ensure full coverage, if there is a remainder you need to increase the result of the division by 1. This represents the need for an additional flagstone to cover that remaining portion.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
