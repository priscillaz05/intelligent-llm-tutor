They will write $x$ angry comments for every occurrence of subsequence 01 and $y$ angry comments for every occurrence of subsequence 10. You should replace all the question marks with 0 or 1 in such a way that the number of angry comments would be as small as possible.\\n\\nString $b$ is a subsequence of string $a$, if it can be obtained by removing some characters from $a$.

The angry comments are calculated based on the number of '01' and '10' subsequences, weighted by x and y respectively.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: A naive approach would involve trying all possible combinations of '0' and '1' for each '?'. However, this would be computationally expensive for longer strings. Edge cases should be considered like strings with no '?' or strings where all characters are '?'.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: A dynamic programming or greedy approach might be suitable. The key is to efficiently calculate the number of '01' and '10' subsequences as we iterate through the string, considering the possible replacements for '?'. The optimal solution can be found by trying to fill all question marks with zeros, then all with ones, and trying intermediate states, keeping track of minimum angry comments.\\n- Implementation Considerations: The final solution should consider if `x <= y` otherwise the string needs to be flipped so that zeros become ones and vice versa. It should calculate the base number of angry comments for the string by replacing all the characters with '0' and then trying to replace all '?' with '1'.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you compute the number of '01' and '10' subsequences in a string efficiently?\",\n    \"How does the relative value of x and y influence the optimal replacement strategy for '?'?\",\n    \"Can you describe a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem?\",\n    \"What would be the base calculation to start from if all characters where replaced with '0' first?\",\n    \"What is the time complexity of the proposed solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The number of '01' subsequences can be computed by iterating through the string and, for each '1', counting the number of '0's that appear before it. Similarly, '10' subsequences can be found by counting '1's before each '0'.\",\n    \"If x < y, it is generally more favorable to replace '?' with '0' to avoid the higher cost of '10' subsequences. Conversely, if x > y, replacing '?' with '1' is often more advantageous.\",\n    \"A dynamic programming approach might not be the most straight forward, but one could imagine computing states of minimum cost with a current suffix, in the case we put zeros and ones on the left. Alternatively, a greedy approach by computing prefixes and suffixes may be helpful.\",\n    \"A base calculation for starting from the string with all characters replaced by zero requires calculation of the number of occurences of \\\"01\\\", and \\\"10\\\". Then all question marks would be replaced with ones, and calculating the minimum comments by changing to ones greedily.\",\n    \"The time complexity of the provided solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
