The function should return the area of the largest such square, not the side length.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Consider edge cases such as an empty matrix or a matrix containing only 0's. Also, address cases where there might be no square (only single 1's) or only a single 1.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Consider dynamic programming as an effective approach to solve this problem. Construct a DP table where each cell (i, j) represents the side length of the largest square ending at that cell.\\n- Implementing the Dynamic Programming Solution: Develop the logic to fill the DP table. Ensure that if matrix[i][j] is '1', then dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1. Handle the base cases when i=0 or j=0. Keep track of the maximum side length encountered so far and compute the area by squaring this value.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean to find the largest square of 1's in a 2D binary matrix, and what should the function return?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: It means identifying the largest square submatrix composed entirely of 1's.
