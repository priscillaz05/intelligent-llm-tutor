"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"The Duck song\\n\\nFor simplicity, we'll assume that there are only three types of grapes: green grapes, purple grapes and black grapes.\\n\\nAndrew, Dmitry and Michal are all grapes' lovers, however their preferences of grapes are different. To make all of them happy, the following should happen: Andrew, Dmitry and Michal should eat at least $x$, $y$ and $z$ grapes, respectively. Andrew has an extreme affinity for green grapes, thus he will eat green grapes and green grapes only. On the other hand, Dmitry is not a fan of black grapes\u00a0\u2014 any types of grapes except black would do for him. In other words, Dmitry can eat green and purple grapes. Michal has a common taste\u00a0\u2014 he enjoys grapes in general and will be pleased with any types of grapes, as long as the quantity is sufficient.\\n\\nKnowing that his friends are so fond of grapes, Aki decided to host a grape party with them. He has prepared a box with $a$ green grapes, $b$ purple grapes and $c$ black grapes.\\n\\nHowever, Aki isn't sure if the box he prepared contains enough grapes to make everyone happy. Can you please find out whether it's possible to distribute grapes so that everyone is happy or Aki has to buy some more grapes?\\n\\nIt is not required to distribute all the grapes, so it's possible that some of them will remain unused.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains three integers $x$, $y$ and $z$ ($1 \\\\le x, y, z \\\\le 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of grapes Andrew, Dmitry and Michal want to eat.\\n\\nThe second line contains three integers $a$, $b$, $c$ ($1 \\\\le a, b, c \\\\le 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of green, purple and black grapes in the box.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nIf there is a grape distribution that allows everyone to be happy, print \\\"YES\\\", otherwise print \\\"NO\\\".\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n1 6 2\\n4 3 3\\n\\nOutput\\nYES\\n\\nInput\\n5 1 1\\n4 3 2\\n\\nOutput\\nNO\\n\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first example, there is only one possible distribution:\\n\\nAndrew should take $1$ green grape, Dmitry should take $3$ remaining green grapes and $3$ purple grapes, and Michal will take $2$ out of $3$ available black grapes.\\n\\nIn the second test, there is no possible distribution, since Andrew is not be able to eat enough green grapes. :(\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())\\n(x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())\\nif a <= x and x - a + y >= b and (x - a + y - b + z >= c):\\n\\tprint('YES')\\nelse:\\n\\tprint('NO')\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understand the problem: The problem asks whether it's possible to satisfy the grape preferences of Andrew, Dmitry, and Michal, given the number of grapes Aki has.\\n- Identify constraints: Andrew only eats green grapes, Dmitry eats green and purple grapes, and Michal eats any grapes. We need to check if there are enough grapes to satisfy everyone's minimum requirements.\\n- Devise a strategy: First, allocate green grapes to Andrew. If there are enough green grapes, then proceed. Otherwise, it's 'NO'. Then, allocate remaining green grapes and purple grapes to Dmitry. If there are enough, proceed. Otherwise, it's 'NO'. Finally, allocate any remaining grapes to Michal. If there are enough, it's 'YES'. Otherwise, it's 'NO'.\\n- Implement the strategy in conditional checks:\\n    - Check if Andrew can get enough green grapes (a >= x). If not, output 'NO'.\\n    - If Andrew has enough green grapes, then Dmitry needs y grapes, and he can eat the remaining green grapes and all purple grapes. So check if (a - x + b) >= y.  (Note: a should be the number of green grapes Aki has, and x should be the number of green grapes Andrew wants, so (a-x) can be negative which is not correct. It should be max(0, a-x)) If (a - x) < 0, the number of green grapes Andrew will get is a instead of x. And this will make the calculation different, so instead of just allocating Andrew the required amount, we allocate him all the green grapes. Therefore, the condition becomes (a >= x and a + b - x >= y and a + b + c - x -y >= z), and if that condition is met, the answer will be YES.\\n    - If both Andrew and Dmitry have enough grapes, then Michal needs z grapes, and he can eat the remaining grapes. So check if (a + b + c - x - y) >= z. If yes, output 'YES'. Otherwise, output 'NO'.\\n- Final Solution: the implementation above should work, but instead of (a - x) which can be negative, we can replace it with (a <= x and x - a + y >= b and (x - a + y - b + z >= c)).\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does each variable x, y, z, a, b, c represent in the problem?\",\n    \"What type of grapes can Andrew, Dmitry, and Michal eat?\",\n    \"How do you determine if there are enough grapes to satisfy everyone's needs?\",\n    \"What is the correct logical condition to check if everyone can be happy given the problem constraints?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"x, y, and z represent the minimum number of grapes Andrew, Dmitry, and Michal want to eat, respectively. a, b, and c represent the number of green, purple, and black grapes Aki has, respectively.\",\n    \"Andrew can only eat green grapes.
