He has set up coordinate axes, and he wants the sides of the rectangle to be parallel to them. Of course, the area of the rectangle must be positive. Wilbur had all four vertices of the planned pool written on a paper, until his friend came along and erased some of the vertices.\\n\\nNow Wilbur is wondering, if the remaining n vertices of the initial rectangle give enough information to restore the area of the planned swimming pool.\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 4)\\u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices that were not erased by Wilbur's friend.\\n\\nEach of the following n lines contains two integers x_{i} and y_{i} ( - 1000 \u2264 x_{i}, y_{i} \u2264 1000)\\u00a0\u2014the coordinates of the i-th vertex that remains. Vertices are given in an arbitrary order.\\n\\nIt's guaranteed that these points are distinct vertices of some rectangle, that has positive area and which sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nPrint the area of the initial rectangle if it could be uniquely determined by the points remaining. Otherwise, print  - 1.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n2\\n0 0\\n1 1\\n\\nOutput\\n1\\n\\nInput\\n1\\n1 1\\n\\nOutput\\n-1\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first sample, two opposite corners of the initial rectangle are given, and that gives enough information to say that the rectangle is actually a unit square.\\n\\nIn the second sample there is only one vertex left and this is definitely not enough to uniquely define the area.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"(sx, sy) = (set(), set())\\nfor i in range(int(input())):\\n\\t(x, y) = map(int, input().split())\\n\\tsx.add(x)\\n\\tsy.add(y)\\nif min(len(sx), len(sy)) == 1:\\n\\tprint(-1)\\nelse:\\n\\t(sx, sy) = (list(sx), list(sy))\\n\\tprint(abs(sx[0] - sx[1]) * abs(sy[0] - sy[1]))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: Recognize the problem requires determining the area of a rectangle given a subset of its vertices. The sides of the rectangle are parallel to the axes.\\n- Identifying Necessary Conditions: Determine that at least two distinct x and y coordinates are needed to uniquely define the rectangle's area. If there's only one distinct x or y, the area cannot be determined and -1 should be outputted.\\n- Developing a Strategy: Read the input, storing x and y coordinates into separate sets to keep distinct values. After reading input, check if the number of distinct x values and distinct y values are both greater than 1. If so, calculate and output the area. Otherwise, print -1.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for the sides of the rectangle to be parallel to the coordinate axes, and how does this constraint simplify the problem?\",\n    \"How many vertices are required to uniquely determine the area of the rectangle, and what specific information must these vertices provide?\",\n    \"What edge cases should be considered, and how would these cases affect the area calculation?\",\n    \"How would you store the distinct x and y coordinates efficiently, and why is it important to use sets?\",\n    \"How can the area of the rectangle be calculated once you have the distinct x and y coordinates?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Having the sides parallel to the coordinate axes means that the sides are horizontal and vertical lines, which simplifies the area calculation to simply finding the difference between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates.\",\n    \"We need at least two vertices with distinct x and y coordinates. These vertices define the length and width of the rectangle, allowing for area calculation.\",\n    \"If there's only one vertex, or all the vertices have the same x or y coordinate, we cannot determine the area uniquely and should output -1. Another edge case is when n=0, which should also output -1.\",\n    \"Using sets to store x and y coordinates will efficiently store distinct values and avoid duplicates, making it faster to determine the number of distinct x and y values.\",\n    \"Once we have the distinct x and y coordinates, we can calculate the absolute difference between the minimum and maximum x values to get the width and the absolute difference between the minimum and maximum y values to get the height, then multiply these to get the area.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
