All column titles will be uppercase.\\n\\nExamples:\\n```\\ntitleTonumber('A') === 1\\ntitleTonumber('Z') === 26\\ntitleTonumber('AA') === 27\\n```\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def title_to_number(title):\\n\\tret = 0\\n\\tfor i in title:\\n\\t\\tret = ret * 26 + ord(i) - 64\\n\\treturn ret\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem Requirements: Recognize the task is to convert an Excel column title (e.g., 'A', 'Z', 'AA') to its corresponding column number. Understand that this is essentially a base-26 number system where A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26, AA=27, etc.\\n- Devising a Conversion Strategy: Realize that each character in the title represents a digit in base 26. The rightmost character is the least significant digit, and the leftmost character is the most significant digit. The conversion requires iterating through the title string from left to right and updating a result variable by multiplying it by 26 and adding the value of the current character.\\n- Handling Character-to-Number Conversion: Understand that each character needs to be converted to its corresponding number (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26). This can be done by finding the ordinal value of the character and subtracting a constant offset (64 in this case, since ord('A') is 65).\\n- Implementation Details: Ensure correct handling of the iteration through the title string and the proper updating of the result variable in each iteration. Handle the base case where the title is empty (though the problem description implies non-empty titles).\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does the Excel column naming system relate to numerical base systems, and how can this guide the conversion strategy?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: The column naming system is analogous to a base-26 numerical system, where A-Z represent the digits 1-26.
