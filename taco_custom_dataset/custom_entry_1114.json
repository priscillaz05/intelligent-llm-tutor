If the powers of both players' cards are equal then they get $1$ point each. \\n- The winner of the game is the player who has more points at the end of $N$ rounds.

Each round involves comparing the 'power' of their cards, which is calculated as the sum of the digits of the number on the card. The player with the higher power wins the round and gets a point. In case of a tie, both players get a point. The task is to determine the winner based on the total points at the end of N rounds.\\n- Breaking Down the Input: The input consists of T test cases. For each test case, there is an integer N indicating the number of rounds. Then N lines follow, each containing two integers representing the numbers on Chef's and Morty's cards for each round, respectively.\\n- Algorithmic Approach: The solution needs to iterate through each round, calculate the power of each player's card, compare the powers, update the scores, and finally determine the winner based on the final scores.\\n- Edge Cases: Need to handle the cases where the power of both cards are equal, and when the final scores are equal (draw).\\n- Output Formatting: The output must follow the format: winner (0 for Chef, 1 for Morty, 2 for Draw) followed by the winner's points.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you calculate the 'power' of a card, and what is its significance in the game?\",\n    \"What are the possible outcomes of a single round in terms of points awarded to Chef and Morty?\",\n    \"How should the scores be updated in case of a tie in a round?\",\n    \"What conditions determine whether the game is a draw, or whether Chef or Morty wins?\",\n    \"After calculating the scores for each round, how should the final output be formatted according to the problem statement?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The power of a card is the sum of the digits of the number on the card. The card with higher power wins the round and a point is awarded.\",\n    \"The possible outcomes are: Chef wins and gets 1 point, Morty wins and gets 1 point, or both tie and get 1 point each.\",\n    \"In case of a tie, both players' scores are incremented by 1.\",\n    \"The game is a draw if both players have the same number of points after N rounds. Chef wins if Chef's total points are greater than Morty's. Morty wins if Morty's total points are greater than Chef's.\",\n    \"The output should be two space-separated integers. The first indicates the winner (0 for Chef, 1 for Morty, 2 for Draw), and the second indicates the number of points the winner had (or either player's points in case of a draw).\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
