In total n courses are availiable for the passage.\\n\\nThe situation is complicated by the dependence of online courses, for each course there is a list of those that must be passed before starting this online course (the list can be empty, it means that there is no limitation).\\n\\nHelp Polycarp to pass the least number of courses in total to get the specialty (it means to pass all main and necessary courses). Write a program which prints the order of courses. \\n\\nPolycarp passes courses consistently, he starts the next course when he finishes the previous one. Each course can't be passed more than once. \\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains n and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of online-courses and the number of main courses of Polycarp's specialty. \\n\\nThe second line contains k distinct integers from 1 to n \u2014 numbers of main online-courses of Polycarp's specialty. \\n\\nThen n lines follow, each of them describes the next course: the i-th of them corresponds to the course i. Each line starts from the integer t_{i} (0 \u2264 t_{i} \u2264 n - 1) \u2014 the number of courses on which the i-th depends. Then there follows the sequence of t_{i} distinct integers from 1 to n \u2014 numbers of courses in random order, on which the i-th depends. It is guaranteed that no course can depend on itself. \\n\\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of all values t_{i} doesn't exceed 10^5. \\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nPrint -1, if there is no the way to get a specialty. \\n\\nOtherwise, in the first line print the integer m \u2014 the minimum number of online-courses which it is necessary to pass to get a specialty. In the second line print m distinct integers \u2014 numbers of courses which it is necessary to pass in the chronological order of their passage.

The program needs to output the order in which these courses should be taken or output -1 if it's impossible to complete all the required courses due to cyclic dependencies.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: The existence of cyclic dependencies between courses can make it impossible to complete all main courses. Edge cases such as an empty set of prerequisites, a large number of courses, and disconnected graph components need to be considered.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: A graph-based approach is suitable, where courses are nodes and dependencies are edges. Depth-First Search (DFS) can be used to traverse the dependency graph and determine the order of courses. Detecting cycles in the graph is crucial to identify impossible scenarios.\\n- Implementing Dependency Resolution: Build a directed graph representing course dependencies. Perform a topological sort or cycle detection algorithm (based on DFS) starting from the main courses. Handle already visited nodes to avoid redundant computations. Properly format the output according to the prompt.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you represent the dependencies between courses, and which data structure would be appropriate?\",\n    \"What steps would you take to check for cyclic dependencies among the courses?\",\n    \"How can you determine the order in which Polycarp should take the courses to minimize the total number of courses taken while ensuring all main courses are completed?\",\n    \"What edge cases or constraints should you consider to ensure the solution is robust and efficient?\",\n    \"If the graph has multiple components, how would you handle determining the total number of courses to take and their order?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"I would represent the course dependencies using a directed graph, where each course is a node and dependencies are directed edges. An adjacency list would be an appropriate data structure to store the graph.\",\n    \"I would use a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to detect cycles. During the DFS, I would maintain a stack to keep track of the courses currently being visited. If I encounter a course already in the stack, it indicates a cycle.\",\n    \"I would start by performing a DFS from each of the main courses. This will determine the courses reachable from each main course. To minimize the total number of courses, I should avoid revisiting already visited courses. The order is determined by the reverse post-order traversal during DFS.\",\n    \"I should consider cases where the input graph is empty, when a course depends on itself (which is guaranteed not to happen according to the prompt), or when there are disconnected components in the graph. I should also handle the case where a cycle exists, which would make it impossible to complete the required courses.\",\n    \"If the graph has multiple components, I would iterate through the main courses and perform a DFS starting from each one. Each traversal would explore one component at a time. The final order of courses would be a concatenation of the course orders obtained from each component traversal, avoiding duplicates.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
