He can perform the operation of \\\"adding one on the segment [l, r]\\\": add one to all elements of the sequence with indices from l to r (inclusive). At that, Peter never chooses any element as the beginning of the segment twice. Similarly, Peter never chooses any element as the end of the segment twice.

The segments must be distinct in terms of their start and end points.\\n- Identifying the Constraints: We have constraints on n and h (<= 2000) and the elements of the array a_i (<= 2000). We also have a modulo constraint (10^9 + 7).\\n- Choosing an Algorithmic Strategy: Dynamic programming seems suitable here. The state can be dp[i][j], where i is the index in the array and j is the number of segments that are currently active (i.e., have started but not ended). The value of dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to reach this state.\\n- Defining Transitions:  We need to consider the difference between h and a[i].  This difference dictates how many segments need to cover a[i] to make it equal to h.  Based on this we can work out the transition between states.\\n- Edge Cases and Modulo Arithmetic: Take special care to handle cases where the difference is negative. Make sure to take the modulo after each operation.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does the constraint 'Peter never chooses any element as the beginning of the segment twice. Similarly, Peter never chooses any element as the end of the segment twice' imply?\",\n    \"How can we represent the state of the array transformation process in a way that allows us to use dynamic programming?\",\n    \"How does the current element a[i] and the target value h affect the possible transitions between states in the dynamic programming approach?\",\n    \"What are the base cases for the dynamic programming approach?\",\n    \"What is the significance of the modulo operation, and why is it important to apply it at each step?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"It implies that once an index has been used as the beginning or end of a segment, it cannot be used again. In other words, each segment has a unique start and end point. This constraint is important because it restricts the possible combinations of segments.\",\n    \"We can use dp[i][j] to represent the number of ways to transform the first i elements of the array such that there are currently j active segments (i.e., segments that have started but not ended).\",\n    \"The difference between h and a[i] determines how many active segments must cover a[i]. If h - a[i] is negative, it is impossible to transform the array. If h - a[i] is 0, then we need to consider how many segments are already active. We can either extend an existing segment or start a new segment, or end an existing segment, as long as the number of active segments remains non-negative.\",\n    \"The base case is dp[0][0] = 1, which means there is one way to transform an empty array with no active segments.\",\n    \"The modulo operation is used to prevent integer overflow since the number of ways can be very large. It is important to apply it at each step to keep the numbers within a manageable range and ensure that the final result is correct.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
