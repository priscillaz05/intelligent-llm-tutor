This can be done by finding the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to N.\\n- Optimizing for Efficiency: Realize that iterating to check each number is a perfect square is not efficient. Instead, take the square root of N and round down. This gives the count directly.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What condition must an integer satisfy to have an odd number of factors?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently count the number of perfect squares from 1 to N?\",\n    \"What mathematical operation can be used to find the largest perfect square less than or equal to N?\",\n    \"Why is the square root approach more efficient than checking each number individually?\",\n    \"What is the time complexity of your approach, and why is it optimal?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"An integer must be a perfect square to have an odd number of factors.\",\n    \"By finding the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to N, which is equivalent to finding the floor of the square root of N.\",\n    \"Taking the square root of N and taking the floor (rounding down) will give the required count.\",\n    \"Checking each number individually would take O(N) time, while using the square root only takes O(sqrt(N)) time, which is significantly more efficient for large N.\",\n    \"The time complexity is O(sqrt(N)) because we only need to compute the square root of N, which dominates the time complexity.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
