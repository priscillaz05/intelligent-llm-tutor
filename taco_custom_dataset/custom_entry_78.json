And then Q queries are given, each containing an integer K. He has to tell how many subarrays satisfy the condition: the function foo returns K when it is applied to the subarray.\\n\\nIn this problem, a subarray is defined as a sequence of continuous elements Ai, Ai+1, ..., Aj  where 0 \u2264 i \u2264 j \u2264 N\u22121. The function foo, when applied to an array, returns the minimum of all the elements in the array.\\n\\nFor example, foo returns 5 when it is applied to the array [7, 5, 10, 7, 5, 8]. Please note that the subarrays Ai, Ai+1, ..., Aj and Ak, Ak+1, ..., Al are different if and only if i \u2260 k or j \u2260 l in this problem.\\n\\n-----Input-----\\nThe first line of input contains N, denoting the size of the array. The next line contains N space separated integers A0, A1, ..., AN\u22121, denoting the array. Then the next line contains Q, denoting the number of queries. Each query consists of one integer per line, denoting K.\\n\\n-----Output-----\\nFor each query, print the required number of subarrays.\\n\\n-----Constraints-----\\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 50\\n- 1 \u2264 Ai \u2264 1000000 (106)\\n- 1 \u2264 Q \u2264 10\\n- 1 \u2264 K \u2264 1000000 (106)\\n\\n-----Example-----\\nInput:\\n5\\n4 1 2 3 4\\n4\\n3\\n4\\n6\\n1\\n\\nOutput:\\n2\\n2\\n0\\n8\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"n = int(input())\\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\\ncnt = {}\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\tmn = a[i]\\n\\tfor j in range(i, n):\\n\\t\\tmn = min(mn, a[j])\\n\\t\\tif mn in cnt:\\n\\t\\t\\tcnt[mn] += 1\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tcnt[mn] = 1\\nq = int(input())\\nfor i in range(q):\\n\\tk = int(input())\\n\\tif k in cnt:\\n\\t\\tprint(cnt[k])\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tprint(0)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: Understand that you need to iterate through all possible subarrays of the input array, calculate the minimum value for each subarray, and then, for each query, count how many subarrays have a minimum value equal to the query value.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: The size of the input array is limited to 50, so a brute-force approach of checking all possible subarrays should be efficient enough. The minimum values can be large so a standard python dictionary is suitable. \\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Implement a nested loop structure to iterate through all possible subarrays. Calculate the minimum value for each subarray. Store the frequency of each minimum value in a dictionary. Process each query by looking up the query value in the dictionary and printing the count or 0 if the value is not in the dictionary.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Efficiently calculate the minimum value of each subarray. Use appropriate data structures (e.g., a dictionary) to store and retrieve the counts of each minimum value efficiently.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you iterate through all possible subarrays of an array?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the minimum value of a subarray efficiently?\",\n    \"What data structure would you use to store the frequency of each minimum value and why?\",\n    \"How would you handle cases where the query value does not exist in the dictionary of minimum values?\",\n    \"What is the time complexity of your approach, and is it efficient enough given the constraints?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"You can iterate through all possible subarrays using nested loops. The outer loop iterates from the starting index i, and the inner loop iterates from i to the end of the array, representing the ending index j of the subarray.\",\n    \"You can calculate the minimum value of a subarray by initializing a variable with the first element of the subarray and then iterating through the rest of the elements, updating the minimum value if a smaller element is found.\",\n    \"I would use a dictionary where the keys are the minimum values of the subarrays and the values are the counts of how many times each minimum value occurs. Dictionaries provide efficient lookups (O(1) on average).\",\n    \"If the query value does not exist in the dictionary, it means no subarray has that minimum value. In this case, you should print 0.\",\n    \"The time complexity is O(N^2) to generate all subarrays and find their minimums, and O(Q) to process the queries, assuming dictionary lookups are O(1). Given that N is at most 50, O(N^2) is acceptable. Also given that Q is at most 10, O(Q) is acceptable.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
