An operation consists of setting one element equal to another.\\n- Identifying the Optimal Strategy: The most efficient approach is to identify the most frequent element in the array. Then, perform operations to set all other elements equal to the most frequent element. The number of operations is equal to the total number of elements minus the frequency of the most frequent element.\\n- Handling Input and Edge Cases: The code needs to handle multiple test cases. It should also work correctly if all elements are the same (frequency equals N) or if all elements are different (frequency equals 1).\\n- Implementing the Solution: Use a Counter to count the frequency of each element. Find the maximum frequency and subtract it from the total number of elements.
