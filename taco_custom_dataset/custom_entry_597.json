The trail is in the form of a k-ary tree. Arjit is lazy, sure, but he's smart. So, he magically moves away from Chandan as far as he can go.\\n\\nChandan doesn't know the way out, but he knows that Arjit has managed to travel the maximum distance he can. Help Chandan find out the maximum distance he would have to travel to find Arjit. And also tell him how much will he have to pay to travel so far. The travel rates are:\\nIf maximum distance is <100, cost = 0.  \\nIf maximum distance is > 100, cost = 100.  \\nIf maximum distance is > 1000, cost = 1000.  \\nIf maximum distance is > 10000, cost = 10000.\\n\\nInput format:\\nFirst line contains the total number of test cases.

The goal is to find the maximum distance Arjit can be from Chandan (the diameter of the tree) and the associated cost based on the given distance thresholds.\\n- Data Input and Graph Representation: The input provides the number of test cases, nodes, and edges with weights. A suitable data structure to represent the tree is an adjacency list where each node maps to a list of its neighbors and the corresponding edge weights.\\n- Algorithm Selection: Since we need to find the maximum distance (diameter) in a tree, a common approach involves using Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) twice. The first BFS/DFS is from an arbitrary node to find the farthest node. Then, a second BFS/DFS is run from this farthest node to find the maximum distance.\\n- Cost Calculation: After determining the maximum distance, we calculate the cost based on the given thresholds: <100, >100, >1000, >10000.\\n- Handling Test Cases: The code needs to handle multiple test cases in a loop.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How should the tree be represented in memory, and why is that representation suitable for this problem?\",\n    \"What algorithm can be used to find the maximum distance in a tree, and why is it effective for this purpose?\",\n    \"How can we handle the cost calculation based on the distance thresholds?\",\n    \"What considerations are necessary for processing multiple test cases correctly?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"An adjacency list is suitable because it efficiently stores the graph's edges and allows for easy traversal.  Each node maps to a list of its adjacent nodes along with the edge weights, which is ideal for BFS/DFS.\",\n    \"BFS or DFS can be used to find the diameter of the tree. The process involves performing a BFS/DFS from an arbitrary node, finding the farthest node from it, and then running a second BFS/DFS from that farthest node. The distance obtained in the second search is the diameter.\",\n    \"After obtaining the maximum distance, we check the value against the thresholds: if distance < 100, cost = 0; if distance > 100 and distance <= 1000, cost = 100; if distance > 1000 and distance <= 10000, cost = 1000; if distance > 10000, cost = 10000.\",\n    \"The code must loop through each test case, reading the input and performing the necessary calculations independently for each case.  Variables should be reset appropriately for each new test case to prevent interference.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
