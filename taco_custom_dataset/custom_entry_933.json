"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"Fukushima Prefecture is also famous for producing fruits, and among them, peaches and apples boast one of the highest production volumes in Japan. By the way, when I made a print manuscript of an English pamphlet for sale, I mistakenly wrote the description about apples and the description about peaches in reverse.\\n\\nYou've been tasked with fixing apple and peach, but it's kind of annoying. Enter a single line of English text and create a program that outputs the English text with all the character strings apple in it replaced with peach and all the character strings peach replaced with apple.\\n\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\nEnglish text (including half-width alphanumeric characters, spaces, and symbols) is given on one line. The length of the string entered is 1000 or less.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nOutputs English sentences with the character strings apple and peach exchanged on one line.\\n\\nExample\\n\\nInput\\n\\nthe cost of one peach is higher than that of one apple.\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nthe cost of one apple is higher than that of one peach.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"(a, p, t) = ('apple', 'peach', '_')\\nprint(input().replace(a, t).replace(p, a).replace(t, p))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires swapping the occurrences of 'apple' and 'peach' in a given string.\\n- Identifying Potential Challenges: Directly replacing 'apple' with 'peach' and 'peach' with 'apple' might lead to incorrect results because the newly replaced 'peach' could be mistaken as an original 'peach' and then replaced with 'apple' again.\\n- Selecting a Strategy: Use a temporary string to avoid the double replacement issue. First, replace 'apple' with a temporary string, then replace 'peach' with 'apple', and finally, replace the temporary string with 'peach'.\\n- Implementation Considerations: The temporary string must be a string that is not originally present in the input to avoid conflicts.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the primary goal of the code?\",\n    \"Why can't we directly replace 'apple' with 'peach' and 'peach' with 'apple'?\",\n    \"What kind of temporary string could be used to prevent conflicts?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases or constraints that we need to consider?\",\n    \"How do you prevent infinite loops or repeated replacements?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The primary goal is to swap all occurrences of the strings 'apple' and 'peach' in the input string.\",\n    \"Directly replacing 'apple' with 'peach' and 'peach' with 'apple' would result in double replacements, where the newly inserted 'peach' would be mistaken for original 'peach' and replaced with 'apple' again.\",\n    \"A temporary string that is not present in the original input, such as '_', can be used to prevent conflicts during the replacement process.\",\n    \"The input string can contain any character, and it is less than 1000 characters long. The temporary string cannot exist within the original input string.\",\n    \"Using a temporary replacement to avoid direct swapping prevents infinite loops. For instance, temporarily replacing 'apple' with a string that is not any word already present in the string.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
