The transformation involves moving the initial consonants to the end of the word and appending \\\"AY\\\". If the word begins with a vowel or contains no consonants at the beginning, just append \\\"AY\\\" or return the word if no changes occur.\\n- Identifying Edge Cases: The important edge case to consider is when the word already starts with a vowel. Also, identify the case when the word doesn't change during the transformation.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: The strategy is to iterate through the input string, identifying the first vowel (if any). The characters before the first vowel (i.e., initial consonants) are stored separately. If the first character is a vowel, return the original word if it equals the transformed word otherwise apply Pig Latin transformation.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Using the index() method could cause issues if the same vowel appears multiple times. However, the prompt indicates only one vowel exists at the start of the word, thus index is acceptable. If the returned value is the same as the original, the transformation hasn't occured so we return the input\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the modified Pig Latin transformation that needs to be implemented?\",\n    \"How should edge cases, like when the word already starts with a vowel or when no transformation occurs, be handled?\",\n    \"How can the initial consonants be identified and stored separately?\",\n    \"How can the algorithm handle the case when no changes occur during the transformation, and the original word should be returned?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The transformation involves moving the initial consonants to the end of the word and appending \\\"AY\\\".
