This is different from standard mathematical precedence where multiplication should have higher precedence than addition, so multiplications should be performed first before additions.\",\n    \"The `int(x == ans) << 1` shifts the result of `x == ans` (which is either 0 or 1) one bit to the left.

Similarly, `int(x == ans)` can be either 0 or 1. These values are then used to calculate the index for the output string 'IMLU'.\",\n    \"The expression is evaluated twice, using eval() for standard math operations respecting operator precedence and then manually calculating a value 'x' that gives preference to multiplication over addition from left to right.
