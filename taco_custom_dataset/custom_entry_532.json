Flipping a column means inverting all the bits in that column (0 becomes 1, and 1 becomes 0). The key insight is that two rows can become identical after flips if they are either identical or the bitwise inverse of each other.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: Iterate through each row of the matrix. For each row, compute both the original row and its bitwise inverse. Use a dictionary to count occurrences of both the original row and its inverse among all rows. The maximum number of identical rows will be the largest count found for either a row or its inverse.\\n- Data Structures: Use a dictionary (or hash map) to store the counts of each row (represented as a tuple) and its inverse. Use a set to track visited rows to prevent redundant calculations.\\n- Edge Cases: The matrix can be empty, or all elements can be the same. Need to handle these gracefully. Also, need to ensure correct handling of the dictionary to avoid key errors.\\n- Implementation details: The rows need to be converted to tuples so they can be used as keys in the dictionary. The inverse of a row can be computed by flipping all the bits.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the core idea for determining if two rows can be made equal through column flips?\",\n    \"How can we represent a row so it can be used as a key in a dictionary for counting?\",\n    \"How would you calculate the bitwise inverse of a row in the matrix?\",\n    \"What data structures could efficiently store and retrieve the count of each row and its inverse?\",\n    \"How would you handle the edge case of an empty matrix or a matrix where all rows are initially identical?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Two rows can be made equal if they are either identical or the bitwise inverse of each other.
