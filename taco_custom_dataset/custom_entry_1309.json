Postfix notation means operators appear after their operands.\\n- Algorithm Selection: A stack-based approach is appropriate. Numbers are pushed onto the stack. When an operator is encountered, the top two numbers are popped, the operation is performed, and the result is pushed back onto the stack.\\n- Data Structures: Use a stack (list in Python) to store the operands.\\n- Handling Operators: Recognize the four operators (+, -, *, /) and perform the corresponding arithmetic operations.\\n- Type Conversion: Convert string digits to integers before performing calculations.\\n- Edge Cases/Error Handling: Though not explicitly mentioned, consider division by zero (implicitly handled via integer division), and malformed input strings (e.g., insufficient operands for an operator).\\n- Final Result: The final element remaining on the stack is the evaluated result.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does postfix notation mean, and how does it differ from infix notation?\",\n    \"Which data structure is most suitable for evaluating postfix expressions, and why?\",\n    \"How should you handle operator precedence in a postfix expression?\",\n    \"What are the steps involved in evaluating the expression when you encounter an operator?\",\n    \"How would you convert the digit characters into integers before processing them?\",\n    \"What error conditions might arise during the evaluation, and how should you handle them?\",\n    \"After all tokens are processed, where can you find the final result of the evaluation?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Postfix notation (also called Reverse Polish Notation) places the operator after its operands. This contrasts with infix notation, where the operator is between the operands. Postfix notation eliminates the need for parentheses to specify the order of operations.\",\n    \"A stack is the most suitable data structure because it allows you to easily push operands onto the stack and pop the last two operands when an operator is encountered.\",\n    \"Postfix notation inherently handles operator precedence.
