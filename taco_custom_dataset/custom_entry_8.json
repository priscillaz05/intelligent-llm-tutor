Choosing a suitable method for comparing character frequencies is essential.\\n- Considering Edge Cases: Note that empty strings, strings of different lengths, and strings with varying character sets should be handled correctly.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Approach: Think about how sorting the characters of each string would make them equal if the original strings are anagrams. Alternative approaches could involve using dictionaries or hash maps to count character frequencies.\\n- Handling Case Insensitivity: Ensure that case differences do not affect the outcome by converting both strings to either upper or lower case before comparison.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What properties must two strings have to be considered anagrams?\",\n    \"How does case sensitivity affect the anagram check, and how can you handle it?\",\n    \"What is an efficient method for comparing the character frequencies in two strings?\",\n    \"Are there any edge cases or special conditions to consider when checking for anagrams, such as empty strings or strings of different lengths?\",\n    \"How can sorting the strings help in determining whether they are anagrams?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Two strings must have the same length and contain the same characters with the same frequency to be considered anagrams.\",\n    \"Case sensitivity can lead to false negatives.
