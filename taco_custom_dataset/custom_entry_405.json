For example, 7 \u00d7 (3 + 2) always means multiplying 7 by the result of 3 + 2 and never means adding 2 to the result of 7 \u00d7 3. However, there are people who do not like parentheses. International Counter of Parentheses Council (ICPC) is attempting to make a notation without parentheses the world standard. They are always making studies of such no-parentheses notations.\\n\\nDr. Tsukuba, a member of ICPC, invented a new parenthesis-free notation. In his notation, a single expression is represented by multiple lines, each of which contains an addition operator (+), a multiplication operator (*) or an integer. An expression is either a single integer or an operator application to operands. Integers are denoted in decimal notation in one line. An operator application is denoted by a line of its operator immediately followed by lines denoting its two or more operands, each of which is an expression, recursively. Note that when an operand is an operator application, it comprises multiple lines.\\n\\nAs expressions may be arbitrarily nested, we have to make it clear which operator is applied to which operands. For that purpose, each of the expressions is given its nesting level. The top level expression has the nesting level of 0. When an expression of level n is an operator application, its operands are expressions of level n + 1. The first line of an expression starts with a sequence of periods (.), the number of which indicates the level of the expression.\\n\\nFor example, 2 + 3 in the regular mathematics is denoted as in Figure 1. An operator can be applied to two or more operands. Operators + and * represent operations of summation of all operands and multiplication of all operands, respectively. For example, Figure 2 shows an expression multiplying 2, 3, and 4. For a more complicated example, an expression (2 + 3 + 4) \u00d7 5 in the regular mathematics can be expressed as in Figure 3 while (2 + 3) \u00d7 4 \u00d7 5 can be expressed as in Figure 4.\\n\\n\\n+\\n.2\\n.3\\n\\n\\nFigure 1: 2 + 3\\n\\n\\n*\\n.2\\n.3\\n.4\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: An expression multiplying 2, 3, and 4\\n\\n\\n*\\n.+\\n..2\\n..3\\n..4\\n.5\\n\\n\\nFigure 3: (2 + 3 + 4) \u00d7 5\\n\\n\\n*\\n.+\\n..2\\n..3\\n.4\\n.5\\n\\n\\nFigure 4: (2 + 3) \u00d7 4 \u00d7 5\\n\\n\\n\\nYour job is to write a program that computes the value of expressions written in Dr. Tsukuba's notation to help him.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe input consists of multiple datasets.

You may also assume that all the input expressions are valid in the Dr. Tsukuba's notation.

Then read the n lines of the expression, storing the level (number of leading periods) and the character (operator or digit) of each line.\\n- Implement a recursive function to evaluate the expression:  The function should take the index of the current line as input. The function determines if the line represents an operator or an integer. If it's an integer, the function returns the integer. If it's an operator, the function recursively calls itself for each operand until the end of the current expression.\\n- Handle the operator calculations: If the current line is '+', recursively calculate the value of each operand and return the sum. If the current line is '*', recursively calculate the value of each operand and return the product.\\n- Determine the end of an operand's expression: When processing operands, continue until a line with the same level as the operator is encountered. This signals the end of the operands for that operator.\\n- Main loop: Read the input datasets until a 0 is encountered.

The nesting level can be determined by counting the number of periods at the beginning of the line.\",\n    \"A recursive function can start from the top level (level 0) and call itself for each operand. The nesting level helps determine the scope of each operand. The recursion continues until reaching integers, which become the base cases for the recursion.\",\n    \"The function can check if the character is '+' or '*' to determine that it is an operator. If the character is not an operator, it must be an integer (as the problem states that every other line is either +,* or an integer).\",\n    \"The scope of each operand is determined by the nesting level. When processing an operator, the function recursively calls itself for the lines directly following the operator and having a nesting level one greater than the operator. It continues until encountering a line at the same level as the operator (which signals the end of that operand's scope).\",\n    \"The base case is when the current line contains an integer. In that case, the function converts the character to an integer and returns it. When an operator is encountered, the recursive calls will compute the values of all operands, and the function will return the result of applying the operator to the operand values.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
