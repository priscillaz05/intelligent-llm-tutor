UNION X Z : Perform union of X and Z i.e. parent of Z will become the parent of X.\\n2. FIND X: Find the parent of X and print it.\\nNote: Initially all are the parent of themselves.\\nInput:\\nN = 5, K = 4\\nqueries[] = {{find 4},\\n             {find 1},\\n             {unionSet 3 1},\\n             {find 3}}\\nOutput:\\n4 1 1\\nExplanation:\\n1. The parent of 4 is 4. Hence the output is 4.\\n2. The parent of 1 is 1. Hence the output is 1.\\n3. After performing unionSet 3 1, parent of 3 becomes 1,\\n   since, parent of 1 is currently 1 itself.\\n4. The parent of 3 is now 1. Hence, the output is 1.\\nYour Task:  \\nYou don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the functions- find() which takes an array A[] and an integer X as an input parameter and return the parent of X and the function unionSet() which takes an array A[] and two integers X and Z and performs the union of X and Z.\\nExpected Time Complexity: O(N)\\nExpected Auxiliary Space: O(1)\\nConstraints:\\n1 <= N, K <= 100\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def find(A, X):\\n\\tif A[X - 1] == X:\\n\\t\\treturn X\\n\\tA[X - 1] = find(A, A[X - 1])\\n\\treturn A[X - 1]\\n\\ndef unionSet(A, X, Z):\\n\\tparentX = find(A, X)\\n\\tparentZ = find(A, Z)\\n\\tif parentX != parentZ:\\n\\t\\tA[parentX - 1] = parentZ\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires implementing a disjoint set data structure with 'find' and 'union' operations. Initially, each element is its own parent. The goal is to efficiently track and update parent-child relationships based on union operations and to find the ultimate parent of any given element.\\n- Implementation Details: The 'find' operation needs to recursively traverse up the parent chain until it finds the root parent (the element which is its own parent). Path compression is used to optimize future 'find' calls. The 'union' operation involves finding the parent of both elements to be united and then making the parent of one element the parent of the other.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the purpose of the find function and how does it determine the parent of an element?\",\n    \"How does the unionSet function merge two sets represented by elements X and Z?\",\n    \"What does it mean when an element is its own parent in this context?\",\n    \"Why is path compression an important optimization in the find function, and how does it improve performance?\",\n    \"Given the constraint 1 <= N <= 100, what is the maximum size the array A will have, and how does this affect the space complexity?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The find function aims to find the ultimate parent (root) of a given element. It recursively checks the parent of the element until it finds an element that is its own parent.\",\n    \"The unionSet function finds the parents of elements X and Z. If the parents are different, it makes the parent of X the parent of Z effectively merging the two sets.\",\n    \"When an element is its own parent, it means that this element is the root or representative of its set.\",\n    \"Path compression optimizes the find function by directly connecting each visited node to the root node, making future lookups faster by shortening the path to the root.\",\n    \"Given the constraint 1 <= N <= 100, the array A will have a maximum size of 100. This means the space complexity will be O(N), where N can be at most 100.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
