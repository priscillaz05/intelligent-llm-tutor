In order to do that, he first needs to know how the social network looks like. He investigated the profile of every other person on the network and noted down the number of his friends. However, he neglected to note down the number of his friends. Help him find out how many friends he has.

Given the number of friends each of the 'n' people have, determine the possible number of friends Bob can have such that the resulting graph is a valid friendship graph.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints: The sum of degrees of all vertices in a graph must be even. Bob's degree (number of friends) must be between 0 and 'n' (number of other people in network).\\n- Devising an Algorithm: The provided ground truth solution makes use of the Erd\u0151s\u2013Gallai theorem to determine if a graph is a valid friendship network. This involves calculating the possible valid range (minimum and maximum) of bob's possible degrees by calculating diffs and altdiffs using prefix sums. First the degree sequence is sorted, and the possible valid degrees are calculated based off that and returned.\\n- Addressing Edge Cases:  It's crucial to consider edge cases where there are no valid solutions (output -1).\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the constraints of a friendship network regarding the number of friendships?\",\n    \"How can the sum of degrees in a graph help in determining valid friendship possibilities for Bob?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently determine all the possible valid values for the number of friends Bob can have?
