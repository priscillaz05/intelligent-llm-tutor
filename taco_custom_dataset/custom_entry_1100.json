The input includes the number of test cases, the number of vertices (N), the number of edges (M), and a list of edges with their corresponding weights.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Since we need to find the MST, Kruskal's algorithm or Prim's algorithm are appropriate choices. Kruskal's algorithm is generally preferred when the graph is sparse (number of edges is much less than N^2).\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: The weights are given as positive integers, and we need to find the *maximum* spanning tree. A common implementation of Kruskal's algorithm finds the *minimum* spanning tree. Therefore, the edge weights must be negated to adapt the standard Kruskal's for the maximum spanning tree.\\n- Implementation Details: Choose Kruskal's algorithm. The algorithm involves sorting the edges by weight (in descending order after negating), and using a disjoint set union data structure to keep track of connected components.\\n- Handling Input/Output: Read the input according to the specified format, and print the total weight of the MST for each test case.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can we modify Kruskal's algorithm, which is commonly used for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree, to find the Maximum Spanning Tree?\",\n    \"What data structure would you use to efficiently keep track of connected components when implementing Kruskal's algorithm, and what are the key operations needed?\",\n    \"How should the input be parsed and stored to efficiently implement Kruskal's algorithm?\",\n    \"What edge cases should be handled, if any, and how would they affect the correctness of the solution?\",\n    \"How can we optimize the code to adhere to the time constraints given the number of vertices and edges?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"To adapt Kruskal's algorithm for finding the Maximum Spanning Tree, we can negate the edge weights before sorting them. This way, edges with larger original weights will have smaller negated weights, and the standard Kruskal's algorithm will effectively select edges in descending order of their original weights.\",\n    \"A disjoint set union (DSU) data structure (also known as union-find) is ideal for tracking connected components. Key operations include `find(x)` to determine the representative (root) of the set containing x, and `union(x, y)` to merge the sets containing x and y.\",\n    \"The input should be parsed according to the problem description. Edges can be stored as a list of tuples (weight, vertex1, vertex2). The list should be sorted in ascending order based on the negated edge weights before applying Kruskal's algorithm.\",\n    \"If the graph is not connected, the MST is not defined. Also empty graph should be considered. No special edge cases need specific handling beyond that Kruskal's correctly handles them.\",\n    \"To optimize, use efficient implementations of sorting and disjoint-set union. For DSU, use path compression and union by rank. Additionally, since the weights can be as large as 10000, an integer is a sufficient data type to store the weight.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
