Specifically, Ayrat loves running, moreover, just running is not enough for him. He is dreaming of making running a real art.\\n\\nFirst, he wants to construct the running track with coating t. On planet AMI-1511 the coating of the track is the sequence of colored blocks, where each block is denoted as the small English letter. Therefore, every coating can be treated as a string.\\n\\nUnfortunately, blocks aren't freely sold to non-business customers, but Ayrat found an infinite number of coatings s. Also, he has scissors and glue. Ayrat is going to buy some coatings s, then cut out from each of them exactly one continuous piece (substring) and glue it to the end of his track coating. Moreover, he may choose to flip this block before glueing it. Ayrat want's to know the minimum number of coating s he needs to buy in order to get the coating t for his running track. Of course, he also want's to know some way to achieve the answer.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nFirst line of the input contains the string s\\u00a0\\u2014 the coating that is present in the shop. Second line contains the string t\\u00a0\\u2014 the coating Ayrat wants to obtain. Both strings are non-empty, consist of only small English letters and their length doesn't exceed 2100.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nThe first line should contain the minimum needed number of coatings n or -1 if it's impossible to create the desired coating.\\n\\nIf the answer is not -1, then the following n lines should contain two integers x_{i} and y_{i}\\u00a0\\u2014 numbers of ending blocks in the corresponding piece. If x_{i} \\u2264 y_{i} then this piece is used in the regular order, and if x_{i} > y_{i} piece is used in the reversed order. Print the pieces in the order they should be glued to get the string t.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\nabc\\ncbaabc\\n\\nOutput\\n2\\n3 1\\n1 3\\n\\nInput\\naaabrytaaa\\nayrat\\n\\nOutput\\n3\\n1 1\\n6 5\\n8 7\\n\\nInput\\nami\\nno\\n\\nOutput\\n-1\\n\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first sample string \\\"cbaabc\\\" = \\\"cba\\\" + \\\"abc\\\".\\n\\nIn the second sample: \\\"ayrat\\\" = \\\"a\\\" + \\\"yr\\\" + \\\"at\\\".\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"(s, t) = (input(), input())\\n(p, d) = ([], [[] for i in range(26)])\\nfor (i, q) in enumerate(s):\\n\\td[ord(q) - 97].append(i)\\n(i, n) = (0, len(t))\\ns += '+'\\nt += '-'\\nwhile i < n:\\n\\tq = t[i]\\n\\ta = b = c = 0\\n\\tfor j in d[ord(q) - 97]:\\n\\t\\tk = 1\\n\\t\\twhile t[i + k] == s[j + k]:\\n\\t\\t\\tk += 1\\n\\t\\tif k > a:\\n\\t\\t\\t(a, b, c) = (k, j + 1, 1)\\n\\t\\tk = 1\\n\\t\\twhile t[i + k] == s[j - k]:\\n\\t\\t\\tk += 1\\n\\t\\tif k > a:\\n\\t\\t\\t(a, b, c) = (k, j + 1, -1)\\n\\tif not a:\\n\\t\\tprint(-1)\\n\\t\\treturn\\n\\ti += a\\n\\tp.append((b, b + c * a - c))\\nprint(len(p))\\nfor (i, j) in p:\\n\\tprint(i, j)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem Requirements: Recognize the need to construct string 't' by concatenating substrings from string 's'. Understand that each substring can be used in its original or reversed form. The goal is to find the minimum number of substrings needed.\\n- Handling Impossible Cases: Identify situations where string 't' cannot be formed from string 's', such as when 't' contains characters not present in 's'.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Be aware of edge cases, such as empty strings or scenarios where a character in 't' does not have a match in 's'. Note the index conversion (+1) during the substring extraction and output.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Consider a greedy approach where, for each character in 't', the longest matching substring in 's' (or its reverse) is selected. Maintain the count of substrings used.  Use a lookup table to store the indices of each character in 's' for efficient searching.\\n- Implementing Substring Search and Reversal: Develop a method to search for the longest matching substring, considering both the original and reversed forms of substrings in 's'. Determine whether a substring should be used in its original or reversed form and keep track of the substring's start and end indices.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the key conditions that determine whether it's impossible to construct the target string 't' from the source string 's'?\",\n    \"If the same character appears multiple times in the source string 's', how should you efficiently locate all potential starting points for a substring match when searching for the longest substring?\",\n    \"When searching for the longest substring match, how do you decide whether to use the original substring or its reversed form, and how does this decision affect the substring's start and end indices?\",\n    \"If no substring from 's' matches a character in 't', what action should be taken, and how should the program respond?\",\n    \"How can you optimize the substring search process to avoid redundant comparisons, particularly when dealing with large strings 's' and 't'?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"It's impossible if 't' contains a character that is not present in 's'.\",\n    \"Create a lookup table or dictionary that maps each character in 's' to a list of its indices. Use this table to efficiently retrieve all possible starting positions for a matching substring.\",\n    \"Choose the form (original or reversed) that provides the longest match. Store a flag or variable to indicate whether the substring is reversed and adjust the start and end indices accordingly (swapping and adjusting the sign).\",\n    \"If no match is found, the program should immediately output -1 and terminate, indicating that the target string 't' cannot be constructed.\",\n    \"Use a lookup table as explained above. Also, a dynamic programming approach or optimized string matching algorithms (e.g., Knuth-Morris-Pratt or Boyer-Moore) could be considered for very large strings.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
