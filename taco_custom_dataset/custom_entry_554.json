However, the problem asks for the largest number L that divides both, not necessarily proving that their GCD is 1.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: The problem simplifies to finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of A and B. Use the Euclidean algorithm or the math.gcd function to compute the GCD.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Ensure that the GCD function is used correctly and that the input is parsed correctly.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for A to have a modular inverse modulo B, and how does this relate to the GCD of A and B?\",\n    \"What is the task asking you to compute, given the numbers A and B?\",\n    \"What standard algorithm or function can you use to efficiently compute the GCD of two numbers?\",\n    \"How should you handle the input to correctly extract the values of A and B for each test case?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A having a modular inverse modulo B implies that A and B are coprime, meaning their GCD is 1.\",\n    \"The task is to find the largest number that divides both A and B, which is equivalent to finding their greatest common divisor (GCD).\",\n    \"I can use the Euclidean algorithm or the math.gcd function in Python to compute the GCD efficiently.\",\n    \"I should use the input() function to read the input, split it into two integers A and B using map(int, input().split()), and then compute their GCD.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
