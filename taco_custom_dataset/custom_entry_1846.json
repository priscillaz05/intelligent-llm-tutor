Consider constraints imposed by unique digits, as this limits the largest possible valid number.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Start by incrementing the given value. Ensure the new value is a multiple of three and odd. Check if the digits are unique. Incrementing by 6 ensures that the number remains a multiple of three and eventually becomes odd. If no solution is found before reaching a certain limit, then return the failure message.\\n- Implementing the Algorithm: Implement the unique digit check by converting the number to a string and confirming the set of characters is equal to the string length. Implement a loop that continues incrementing until all three conditions are met or the limit is reached.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the specific constraints that the number must meet to be considered a valid solution?\",\n    \"How would you check if a number's digits are unique?\",\n    \"What is the smallest increment that would ensure the number remains a multiple of three and become odd if it wasn't before?\",\n    \"What is the upper bound on the number to avoid infinite loops, and what message should be returned if no valid number is found within this bound?\",\n    \"After incrementing the number, what order should we follow to check if it meets the given conditions, and why?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The number must be greater than the given value, its digits must be unique, it must be odd, and it must be a multiple of three.\",\n    \"Convert the number to a string, then check if the length of the set of characters in the string is equal to the length of the string.
