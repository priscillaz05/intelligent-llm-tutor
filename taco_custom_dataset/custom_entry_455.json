In this kata you will have to complete a function that take 2 arguments: \\n\\n- A string, that correspond to what the daugther says.\\n- A string, that tell you wich fairy the girl have met, this one can be `good` or `evil`. \\n\\nThe function should return the following count as a hash:\\n\\n- If the girl have met the `good` fairy:\\n  - count 1 `ruby` everytime you see a `r` and 2 everytime you see a `R`\\n  - count 1 `crystal` everytime you see a `c` and 2 everytime you see a `C`\\n- If the girl have met the `evil` fairy: \\n  - count 1 `python` everytime you see a `p` and 2 everytime uou see a `P`\\n  - count 1 `squirrel` everytime you see a `s` and 2 everytime you see a `S`\\n  \\n**Note**: For this kata I decided to remplace the normal `Diamonds` and `Toads` by some programming languages. And just discover that [Squirrel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirrel_(programming_language) is a programming language.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"from collections import Counter\\n\\ndef diamonds_and_toads(sentence, fairy):\\n\\tc = Counter(sentence)\\n\\td = {'good': ['ruby', 'crystal'], 'evil': ['python', 'squirrel']}\\n\\treturn {s: c[s[0]] + 2 * c[s[0].upper()] for s in d[fairy]}\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem is to count certain characters in a string based on whether the fairy is 'good' or 'evil'. If the fairy is 'good', we count 'r'/'R' for 'ruby' and 'c'/'C' for 'crystal'. If the fairy is 'evil', we count 'p'/'P' for 'python' and 's'/'S' for 'squirrel'. Uppercase characters are worth twice as much as lowercase characters.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: Use a dictionary to map the fairy type to the words to count (e.g., 'good' -> ['ruby', 'crystal']). Count lowercase and uppercase occurrences separately, and calculate the weighted sum (lowercase count + 2 * uppercase count). Return the results as a dictionary.\\n- Data Structures: Use a `Counter` object to count occurrences of each character in the input string. Use a dictionary to store word-fairy mappings. Use another dictionary to hold results.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you handle counting both lowercase and uppercase occurrences of the same letter and applying different weights?\",\n    \"How can you map the 'good' or 'evil' fairy type to the correct words ('ruby', 'crystal' or 'python', 'squirrel') to count?\",\n    \"What data structure is best suited to counting characters in a string?\",\n    \"How can you concisely create and return a dictionary with the required counts for the specified words?\",\n    \"How do you handle invalid fairy input (e.g., if the input fairy is neither 'good' nor 'evil')?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"I would use the `Counter` object to get the counts of each character, lowercase and uppercase separately. Then calculate `count_lowercase + 2 * count_uppercase`.\",\n    \"I can use a dictionary such as `{'good': ['ruby', 'crystal'], 'evil': ['python', 'squirrel']}`.\",\n    \"A `Counter` object from the `collections` module is well-suited for counting characters in a string.\",\n    \"I can use a dictionary comprehension like `{s: c[s[0]] + 2 * c[s[0].upper()] for s in d[fairy]}`.\",\n    \"I would raise an exception or return an error value. An if/else check on the fairy input would be required for that, like `if fairy not in d: raise ValueError('invalid fairy type')`.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
