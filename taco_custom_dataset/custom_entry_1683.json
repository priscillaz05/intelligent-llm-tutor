Handle cases where either string is empty or their lengths are less than 2.\\n- Exploring String Rotation Methods: Consider both clockwise and counter-clockwise rotations by two positions. Implement these rotations using string slicing.\\n- Comparing Rotated Strings: After performing the rotations, compare the resulting strings with the target string 'b'.
