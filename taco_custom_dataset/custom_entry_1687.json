"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"Chef has $N$ decimal strings $S_{1}, S_{2}, \\ldots, S_{N}$ with him (that is, each of these strings contains only characters '0' through '9'). The characters in all strings are indexed starting from $1$. Chef wants to form a single long string $W$ by *interleaving* all these strings.\\n\\nA string $W$ is said to be formed by interleaving $S_{1}, S_{2}, \\ldots, S_{N}$ if the characters of $W$ can be partitioned into $N$ subsequences $T_{1}, T_{2}, \\ldots, T_{N}$ such that for each valid $i$, $T_{i}$ is identical to the string $S_{i}$. Formally, for each valid $i$, the subsequence $T_{i}$ must have length $|S_{i}|$; let's denote $T_{i} = (T_{i, 1}, T_{i, 2}, \\ldots, T_{i, |S_{i}|})$, where $1 \u2264 T_{i, j} \u2264 N$ and $T_{i, j} < T_{i, j+1}$ for each valid $j$. Each integer between $1$ and $|W| = |S_{1}| + |S_{2}| + \\ldots + |S_{N}|$ inclusive must occur in exactly one of these subsequences, and for each valid $i$ and $j$, the $T_{i, j}$-th character of $W$ must be identical to the $j$-th character of $S_{i}$. For example, if $S_{1}$ is \\\"123\\\", $S_{2}$ is \\\"456\\\" and $S_{3}$ is \\\"789\\\", then the strings \\\"124758963\\\" and \\\"123456789\\\" are formed by interleaving these strings, but \\\"123456798\\\" is not.\\n\\nThe *cost* of the interleaved string $W$ is defined as $\\\\sum_{i=2}^{|W|} |W_{i} - W_{i-1}|^2$, where $W_{i}$ denotes the integer represented by the $i$-th character of $W$. For example, if $W$ is \\\"124\\\", then its cost is $|2 - 1|^2 + |4 - 2|^2 = 1 + 4 = 5$.\\n\\nChef wants you to find an interleaved string $W$. The cost of this string should be as low as possible.\\n\\n------ Input ------\\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $N$.\\n$N$ lines follow. For each $i$ ($1 \u2264 i \u2264 N$), the $i$-th of these lines contains a single string $S_{i}$.\\n\\n------ Output ------\\nPrint a single line containing $|W| = |S_{1}| + |S_{2}| + \\ldots + |S_{N}|$ space-separated integers. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these integers (let's denote it by $x$) should denote that the $i$-th character of your interleaved string comes from the string $S_{x}$.\\nYour output will be considered valid if for each $i$ ($1 \u2264 i \u2264 N$), your output contains the integer $i$ exactly $|S_{i}|$ times.\\n\\n------ Constraints ------\\n$N = 10,000$\\n$|S_{i}| = 100$ for each valid $i$\\n$S_{1}, S_{2}, \\ldots, S_{N}$ contain only decimal digits, i.e. characters '0' through '9'\\n\\n------ Scoring ------\\nThe score of each test case (and therefore each test file) is the cost of the string $W$ described by your output, i.e. $\\\\sum_{i=2}^{|W|} |W_{i} - W_{i-1}|^2$. The score of a submission is the sum of scores of all test files. Your goal is to minimise the score of your submission.\\n\\nIf your output is invalid, the verdict of your submission will be Wrong Answer.\\n\\nThere are twenty test files - ten of each type described below. During the contest, the displayed score will account for exactly four test files, i.e. your score reflects your submission's performance on 20% (4/20) of the test files, two for each of the types described below. However, if your program gets a non-AC verdict on any test file, your submission's verdict will be non-AC. In other words, an AC verdict denotes that your program runs successfully on all the test files. After the end of the contest, your score will be changed to include the sum of your program's scores over the other sixteen test files.\\n\\n------ Example Input ------\\n\\n3\\n123\\n456\\n789\\n\\n------ Example Output ------\\n\\n1 1 2 3 2 3 3 2 1\\n\\n------ Explanation ------\\nThe output corresponds to the string \\\"124758963\\\". The score for this test file would be the cost of this string, which is $46$.\\n\\nTest Generation Process\\nThere are two types of test files.\\n\\nType 1: Each character of each string is chosen uniformly randomly from the set {'0', '1', ..., '9'}.\\n\\nType 2: Each character of each string is chosen randomly from the set {'0', '1', ..., '9'}. The probability of '0' being chosen is $0.4$, the probability of '1' being chosen is also $0.4$ and the probability of each of the remaining 8 characters being chosen is $0.025$.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import numpy as np\\ntry:\\n\\tN = int(input())\\n\\tk = 100\\n\\ta = np.zeros([N, k])\\n\\ta = [[int(x) for x in input()] for i in range(N)]\\n\\tfor ctr in range(k):\\n\\t\\tb = [[i, a[i][ctr]] for i in range(N)]\\n\\t\\tfor x in range(10):\\n\\t\\t\\tt = x if ctr % 2 == 0 else 9 - x\\n\\t\\t\\tfor m in range(len(b)):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif b[m][1] == t:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tprint(b[m][0] + 1, end=' ')\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tb[m][0] = -1\\n\\t\\t\\tfilter(lambda y: y[0] > -1, b)\\nexcept:\\n\\tpass\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the problem: The task is to interleave N strings of digits such that the cost of the resulting string is minimized. The cost is the sum of squared differences between adjacent digits.\\n- Strategy for minimizing cost: Since the cost function penalizes large differences between adjacent digits, the objective is to keep adjacent digits as close as possible.  A greedy approach could be considered, selecting the next digit from the string that results in the smallest cost increase. This might involve sorting the available digits at each step based on their proximity to the last digit added to the interleaved string.\\n- Implementation details: Need to keep track of the current index of each string. Need to iterate through the total length of the interleaved string, and at each step, decide which string to take the next character from.  A helper function to calculate the cost of adding a digit would be useful.\\n- Consider edge cases and constraints:  All strings must be fully represented in the interleaved string.  Each string S_i contributes |S_i| characters. The constraints N=10000 and |S_i|=100 are large, so an efficient implementation is crucial.  The scoring function is sensitive to the solution quality, so small improvements can lead to a better score. The provided ground truth solution shows an interesting alternating pattern based on even/odd `ctr` value, which suggests a potential better approach.\\n- Optimized solution: The provided code initializes a matrix `a` where `a[i][ctr]` represents the ctr-th digit in the i-th string. For each column (i.e., each digit position across all strings), the code iterates through the digits 0 to 9 (or 9 to 0 if ctr is odd), selecting the string that has that digit at the current position. This seems to be optimizing to reduce cost.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can we define a metric to measure the 'closeness' of two digits, considering the cost function?\",\n    \"How can we efficiently determine which string to pick the next digit from to minimize the cost increase at each step?\",\n    \"What data structure would be suitable for keeping track of the current index of each string during the interleaving process?\",\n    \"How can we ensure that all strings are fully represented in the final interleaved string, satisfying the problem constraints?\",\n    \"Given the alternating pattern present in the example solution, what reasoning could be used to arrive at such a strategy for minimizing cost?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The 'closeness' can be defined by the absolute difference between the digits, or more accurately, the square of the absolute difference, as that is what the cost function uses.\",\n    \"We can calculate the cost increase for adding the next digit from each available string and select the string that results in the smallest increase.  This can be sped up using sorting.\",\n    \"A simple array of integers, indexed by the string number, can be used to store the current index of each string.\",\n    \"Before selecting the next digit, check if all characters of each string have been used and ensure that after picking a character, each string i contributes exactly |S_i| characters.\",\n    \"The solution may be attempting to keep adjacent characters similar on average by ordering by increasing digits for even `ctr` values and by decreasing for odd. This can help to avoid large jumps in value between adjacent characters.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
