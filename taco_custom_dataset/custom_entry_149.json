Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.\\n \\nExample 1:\\nInput:\\nN = 3\\nasteroids[ ] = {3, 5, -3}\\nOutput: {3, 5}\\nExplanation: The asteroid 5 and -3 collide resulting in 5.

The goal is to determine the final state of the asteroids after all collisions have occurred. The key rules are: smaller asteroids explode, equal size asteroids both explode, and same direction asteroids never collide.\\n- Selecting a Data Structure: A stack is an appropriate data structure to maintain the state of asteroids as collisions happen. The stack's top will represent the asteroid that is closest to a potential collision.\\n- Defining Collision Logic: When a negative asteroid encounters a positive asteroid in the stack, a collision occurs. The logic should compare their sizes. If the negative asteroid is larger, the positive asteroid pops. If the positive asteroid is larger, the negative asteroid is discarded. If they're equal, both are discarded.\\n- Handling Stack Interactions: While the collision happens inside a while loop, if the stack becomes empty or the top of stack is also moving in the same direction as the incoming asteroid, then the collision is no longer possible, the incoming asteroid should be pushed to the stack.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What data structure is suitable to keep track of asteroids and why?\",\n    \"What are the possible outcomes when two asteroids moving in opposite directions collide?\",\n    \"How should the algorithm handle the edge case when the stack is empty or contains asteroids moving in the same direction as the incoming asteroid?\",\n    \"How do we efficiently determine whether a collision is possible between asteroids?\",\n    \"What is the expected output if all the asteroids end up exploding during the collisions?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A stack is suitable because it allows for easy tracking of the most recently added asteroid, which is the asteroid closest to a collision. It facilitates evaluating collisions between adjacent asteroids efficiently.\",\n    \"When two asteroids collide, there are three possible outcomes: the smaller asteroid explodes (is discarded), the larger asteroid continues moving, or both asteroids explode if they have the same size.\",\n    \"If the stack is empty, the incoming asteroid is directly added to the stack as there's nothing to collide with. If the incoming asteroid moves in the same direction as the asteroids in the stack, a collision is not possible and the incoming asteroid gets pushed to the stack.\",\n    \"To determine whether a collision is possible, check if the top of the stack is positive (moving right) and the incoming asteroid is negative (moving left).\",\n    \"If all the asteroids explode during the collisions, the final output will be an empty array/list.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
