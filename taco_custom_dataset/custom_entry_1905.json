Each step in the path can move either directly below or diagonally to the right.\\n- Identifying an algorithmic approach: A dynamic programming approach can be used to solve this problem efficiently. Starting from the bottom row, we can work our way up, updating each node with the maximum possible sum from that node to the bottom.\\n- Implementation details: The core idea is to iterate through the triangle from the second-to-last row up to the first row. For each element in a row, we update its value to be the sum of itself and the maximum of its two children (the elements directly below and diagonally below to the right). After processing all rows, the top element (l[0][0]) will contain the maximum path sum.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the meaning of the problem, and what are the constraints?\",\n    \"Can you explain the dynamic programming approach and how it applies to the problem?\",\n    \"How do you handle the edge cases (e.g. when N=1) and ensure correctness?\",\n    \"What is the time and space complexity of the provided solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The problem is to find the maximum sum of a path from the top to the bottom of a triangle, where each step can be either directly below or diagonally to the right. The constraints include the bounds on the number of test cases, the number of rows, and the values in the triangle.\",\n    \"The dynamic programming approach involves building up solutions to subproblems and using them to solve larger problems. In this case, we start from the bottom of the triangle and work our way up. For each node, we update its value to be the sum of itself and the maximum of its two children. This ensures that each node contains the maximum path sum starting from that node.\",\n    \"The base case is when N=1, where the maximum path sum is simply the single number in the triangle. The code handles this case correctly. The iteration direction (from bottom to top) is also crucial in ensuring correctness, as it allows us to use the already computed maximum path sums from the lower rows.\",\n    \"The time complexity is O(N^2) because there are nested loops that iterate through the triangle. The outer loop iterates from the second-to-last row to the first row (N iterations). The inner loop iterates through each element in the current row (at most N iterations). The space complexity is O(N^2) because the code stores the triangle of numbers in a list of lists.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
