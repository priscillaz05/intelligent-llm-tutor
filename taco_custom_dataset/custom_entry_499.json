A good string is one where the distance between every two adjacent character is exactly 1. Here distance is defined by minimum distance between two character when alphabets from 'a' to 'z' are put in cyclic manner. For example distance between 'a' to 'c' is 2 and distance between 'a' to 'y' is also 2. The task is to print \\\"YES\\\" or \\\"NO\\\" (without quotes) depending on whether the given string is Good or not.\\n \\nExample 1:\\nInput: s = \\\"aaa\\\"\\nOutput: NO\\nExplanation: distance between 'a' and 'a' is not 1.\\n \\nExample 2:\\nInput: s = \\\"cbc\\\"\\nOutput: YES\\nExplanation: distance between 'b' and 'c' is 1.\\n \\nYour Task:  \\nYou don't need to read input or print anything.

More precisely, the distance can be 1 or 25.\\n- Iterating Through the String: Iterate through the string, checking the distance between each pair of adjacent characters.\\n- Implementing the Logic: Calculate the distance between adjacent characters and return 'NO' if the distance is not 1 or 25.
