The modulo operation is critical for preventing integer overflow. Deriving a formula is necessary to handle the constraints and large inputs.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: It looks like the ground truth solution utilizes number theory and modular arithmetic to come to a closed form solution to avoid a brute force approach. Trying to explain this closed form solution is likely the intended strategy.\\n- Implementation Considerations: The calculation appears to heavily rely on modular exponentiation, likely needed because we are dealing with potentially very large numbers and need to stay within the bounds defined by the modulo.

Performing the modulo operation after each calculation avoids creating massive numbers and helps keep calculations tractable.\",\n    \"A naive brute-force approach would involve trying all possible camera placements and checking if they satisfy the constraints. This is inefficient for larger grids, as the number of possible arrangements grows exponentially.\",\n    \"n1, n2, n3 are used to divide n into groups that repeat every 3 rows and m1, m2, and m3 do the same for the columns.

It's utilized in the `modexp` function to calculate powers of 2 and 3 modulo $10^9+7$, which are likely parts of a closed form equation derived from number theory to solve the arrangement problem.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
