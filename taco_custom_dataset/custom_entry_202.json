The problem requires you to choose one element from array $A$ and one element from array $B$ such that their sum is not present in either array $A$ or array $B$.\\n- Devise a Plan: Since the size of arrays $A$ and $B$ are small ($n, m \\\\le 100$), a brute-force approach should be efficient enough to solve this problem. Iterate through each possible pair of elements $a$ from array $A$ and $b$ from array $B$. Check if their sum $a + b$ is present in either array. If the sum is not found in either array, output the pair and exit. Since it's guaranteed that a solution exists, exit immediately upon finding the first valid solution.\\n- Implement the Algorithm: Combine the elements of arrays $A$ and $B$ into a single array $C$. Iterate through all pairs $a$ from $A$ and $b$ from $B$. Check if the sum $a + b$ is present in $C$. If it's not, then print $a$ and $b$ and exit the program.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the constraints on the size of arrays A and B?\",\n    \"What is the range of values for elements in A and B?\",\n    \"How should the output be formatted?\",\n    \"Is there a guarantee that a valid solution exists?\",\n    \"Can I assume that the elements within array B are unique?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The size of array A (n) is between 1 and 100, and the size of array B (m) is between 1 and 100.\",\n    \"The elements in both A and B are positive integers between 1 and 200.\",\n    \"The output should be two numbers, a from A and b from B, separated by a space.\",\n    \"Yes, the problem statement guarantees that a solution always exists.\",\n    \"Yes, the problem statement specifies that the elements within array B are distinct.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
