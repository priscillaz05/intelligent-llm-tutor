The side length of this inner cube is n - 2 (if n > 2; otherwise, it's 0).\\n- Handle Edge Cases: Consider cases where n is less than or equal to 2, in which case there are no non-visible cubes.\\n- Calculate the Volume: Compute the volume of the inner cube, which represents the number of non-visible cubes.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the relationship between the side length of the big cube (n) and the side length of the cube formed by the non-visible cubes?\",\n    \"How do you handle edge cases where n is small, like n <= 2, and why are they important?\",\n    \"If n is greater than 2, how would you calculate the number of non-visible cubes based on the side length of the inner cube?\",\n    \"How can you ensure that your solution handles all possible integer inputs for n correctly, including negative inputs?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The side length of the cube formed by the non-visible cubes is n - 2.\",\n    \"If n <= 2, there are no non-visible cubes because the outer layer encompasses all cubes.
