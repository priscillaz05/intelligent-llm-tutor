Chef would like you to feel his happiness and provide him with a solution for this new problem with a sequence of integers. The problem is as follows.\\nYou are given a sequence $A_1, A_2, \\\\dots, A_N$. You need to determine if it is possible to choose two indices $i$ and $j$ such that $A_i \\\\neq A_j$, but $A_{A_i}$ = $A_{A_j}$.

The description of $T$ test cases follows.\\n- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.\\n- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \\\\ldots, A_N$.\\n\\n-----Output-----\\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string \\\"Truly Happy\\\" if it is possible to choose required indices or \\\"Poor Chef\\\" otherwise.\\n\\n-----Constraints-----\\n- $1 \\\\le T \\\\le 1,000$\\n- $1 \\\\le N \\\\le 10^5$\\n- $1 \\\\le A_i \\\\le N$ for each valid $i$\\n- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\\\cdot 10^5$\\n\\n-----Subtasks-----\\nSubtask #1 (27 points): $1 \\\\le N \\\\le 1,000$\\nSubtask #2 (73 points): original constraints\\n\\n-----Example Input-----\\n4\\n4\\n1 1 2 3\\n4\\n2 1 3 3\\n5\\n5 4 4 3 1\\n5\\n3 2 1 1 4\\n\\n-----Example Output-----\\nTruly Happy\\nPoor Chef\\nPoor Chef\\nTruly Happy\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"t = int(input())\\nfor _ in range(t):\\n\\tN = int(input())\\n\\tdict1 = {}\\n\\tflag = False\\n\\tS = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\\n\\tfor i in range(N):\\n\\t\\tif S[i] in dict1.keys():\\n\\t\\t\\tdict1[S[i]].append(i + 1)\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tdict1[S[i]] = [i + 1]\\n\\tfor (key, val) in dict1.items():\\n\\t\\tif len(val) == 1:\\n\\t\\t\\tcontinue\\n\\t\\tcount = 0\\n\\t\\tfor e in val:\\n\\t\\t\\tif e in dict1.keys():\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcount += 1\\n\\t\\t\\tif count == 2:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tflag = True\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\t\\tif flag == True:\\n\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\tif flag == True:\\n\\t\\tprint('Truly Happy')\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tprint('Poor Chef')\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The goal is to find two distinct indices i and j such that A[i] != A[j] but A[A[i]] == A[A[j]]. This means we are looking for two different values in the array A, whose corresponding values in A at those indices are the same.\\n- Identifying Key Data Structures: A dictionary can be used to store the occurrences of each number. For each number, we can store the indices where it appears in the input array.\\n- Algorithm Selection: Iterate through the array and store indices of elements with same value. If there are multiple indices for a single value, check for the 'Truly Happy' condition. Iterate through the dictionary containing values and indices and check if a valid pair of indices can be found.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the core condition that needs to be satisfied for Chef to be 'Truly Happy'?\",\n    \"What data structure is best suited for storing the indices of equal values in the array?\",\n    \"How can we iterate through the dictionary of values and indices to efficiently check for a valid pair of indices that satisfy the 'Truly Happy' condition?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The core condition is to find two indices i and j such that A[i] != A[j], but A[A[i]] == A[A[j]]. In essence, two different values at different positions point to the same value in the array.\",\n    \"A dictionary (or hash map) is a suitable data structure. The keys of the dictionary would be the values present in the array A, and the corresponding values would be a list of the indices where that value occurs.\",\n    \"Iterate through the dictionary. For each value (key), if the list of indices associated with that value has a length greater than 1, then consider all possible pairs of indices (i, j) from that list. Calculate A[A[i]] and A[A[j]]. If A[A[i]] is equal to A[A[j]] and A[i] != A[j] , return 'Truly Happy'. If after checking all pairs no such condition is met, then print 'Poor Chef'.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
