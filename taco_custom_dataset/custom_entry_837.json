This approach needs to be optimized.\\n- Optimizing the Search Space: Recognize that since 'a' and 'b' are related by a^3 + b^3 = N, the maximum value of 'a' is limited by the cube root of N. Similarly, given 'a', 'b' can be derived and must be non-negative.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Consider cases where N is small or when a specific value for 'a' results in b^3 being negative or zero. Special case for when N=1.\\n- Avoiding Duplicates: Ensure that the same pair (a, b) isn't counted multiple times and that 'a' is always >= 1 and 'b' is >= 0.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you optimize the search for possible values of 'a' and 'b' to avoid a brute-force approach?\",\n    \"What is the upper limit for 'a' based on the given constraint a^3 + b^3 = N, and how can you derive it?\",\n    \"Given a value for 'a', how do you calculate 'b' and ensure it meets the problem's constraints?\",\n    \"What edge cases should be handled to avoid incorrect calculations or counting errors?\",\n    \"How would you handle the constraints on 'a' and 'b' (a >= 1, b >= 0) to ensure accurate results?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"By recognizing the relationship between 'a', 'b', and N, we can iterate through possible values of 'a' up to the cube root of N, calculate 'b', and check if the condition a^3 + b^3 = N is met.\",\n    \"The upper limit for 'a' is the cube root of N because if 'a' is greater than this value, then b^3 must be negative, which violates the problem constraints that b must be non-negative.\",\n    \"Given a value for 'a', we can calculate b^3 as N - a^3. Then 'b' is the cube root of b^3. We must also ensure that b is non-negative and that b is an integer; otherwise, this (a,b) pair does not work.\",\n    \"Edge cases include when N is small, or when a specific value for 'a' results in a negative value for b^3. Also, when calculating 'b', it needs to be rounded to the nearest integer and checked if its cube equals b^3. Consider the special case when N = 1.\",\n    \"The constraint a >= 1 is enforced by starting the loop for 'a' at 1. The constraint b >= 0 is handled when b^3 is computed, and if b^3 < 0, the 'a' value being evaluated is too high and is skipped using a break statement. Also need to check that b is an integer.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
