A cavity is a cell that is not on the border and is strictly deeper than all its adjacent cells (top, left, right, bottom). The depth of each cavity should be replaced with 'X'.\\n- Defining Adjacency:  Understand that adjacent cells share a common side (up, down, left, right).\\n- Identifying Border Cells: Border cells should not be considered as cavities.\\n- Choosing an Iteration Strategy: Iterate through the inner cells of the grid (excluding the borders).\\n- Comparing Depths: For each inner cell, compare its depth with the depths of its four adjacent cells. If the current cell is deeper than all its adjacent cells, it's a cavity.\\n- Modifying Cavities: Replace the depth of each identified cavity with 'X'.\\n- Outputting Modified Grid: Print the modified grid, ensuring each row is printed as a string.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What defines a 'cavity' in the grid, and why are border cells excluded?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: A cavity is a non-border cell that is strictly deeper than all its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right). Border cells are excluded because they don't have all four adjacent cells to compare with.\",\n    \"How should the comparison between a cell and its neighbors be performed?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: The cell's depth (value) must be strictly greater than the depths of all its adjacent cells to qualify as a cavity.\",\n    \"Given the constraints, what is the range of indices that need to be checked for potential cavities?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: Since border cells are excluded, the iteration should start from index 1 and end at n-2 (inclusive) for both rows and columns, where n is the size of the grid.\",\n    \"After identifying cavities, how should the grid be modified and presented as the final output?\",\n    \"Expected Answer:  The depth of each cavity cell should be replaced with the character 'X'.
