The goal is to determine which packet has greater tastiness or if they are equal.\\n- Calculation of Total Tastiness:  Multiply the tastiness of one chocolate bar (X) by 2 to get the total tastiness of a chocolate packet. Multiply the tastiness of one candy piece (Y) by 5 to get the total tastiness of a candy packet.\\n- Comparison and Output: Compare the total tastiness of the chocolate packet with the candy packet.
