"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"You are playing a game where your character should overcome different obstacles. The current problem is to come down from a cliff. The cliff has height $h$, and there is a moving platform on each height $x$ from $1$ to $h$.\\n\\nEach platform is either hidden inside the cliff or moved out. At first, there are $n$ moved out platforms on heights $p_1, p_2, \\\\dots, p_n$. The platform on height $h$ is moved out (and the character is initially standing there).\\n\\nIf you character is standing on some moved out platform on height $x$, then he can pull a special lever, which switches the state of two platforms: on height $x$ and $x - 1$. In other words, the platform you are currently standing on will hide in the cliff and the platform one unit below will change it state: it will hide if it was moved out or move out if it was hidden. In the second case, you will safely land on it. Note that this is the only way to move from one platform to another.\\n\\nYour character is quite fragile, so it can safely fall from the height no more than $2$. In other words falling from the platform $x$ to platform $x - 2$ is okay, but falling from $x$ to $x - 3$ (or lower) is certain death. \\n\\nSometimes it's not possible to come down from the cliff, but you can always buy (for donate currency) several magic crystals. Each magic crystal can be used to change the state of any single platform (except platform on height $h$, which is unaffected by the crystals). After being used, the crystal disappears.\\n\\nWhat is the minimum number of magic crystal you need to buy to safely land on the $0$ ground level?\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains one integer $q$ ($1 \\\\le q \\\\le 100$) \u2014 the number of queries. Each query contains two lines and is independent of all other queries.\\n\\nThe first line of each query contains two integers $h$ and $n$ ($1 \\\\le h \\\\le 10^9$, $1 \\\\le n \\\\le \\\\min(h, 2 \\\\cdot 10^5)$) \u2014 the height of the cliff and the number of moved out platforms.\\n\\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $p_1, p_2, \\\\dots, p_n$ ($h = p_1 > p_2 > \\\\dots > p_n \\\\ge 1$) \u2014 the corresponding moved out platforms in the descending order of their heights.\\n\\nThe sum of $n$ over all queries does not exceed $2 \\\\cdot 10^5$.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nFor each query print one integer \u2014 the minimum number of magic crystals you have to spend to safely come down on the ground level (with height $0$).\\n\\n\\n-----Example-----\\nInput\\n4\\n3 2\\n3 1\\n8 6\\n8 7 6 5 3 2\\n9 6\\n9 8 5 4 3 1\\n1 1\\n1\\n\\nOutput\\n0\\n1\\n2\\n0\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import sys\\nimport math\\ninput = sys.stdin.readline\\nq = int(input())\\nfor i in range(q):\\n\\t(h, n) = map(int, input().split())\\n\\tarr = list(map(int, input().split()))\\n\\tarr.append(0)\\n\\tcount = 0\\n\\tcur = 0\\n\\tnow = arr[cur]\\n\\tcur = 1\\n\\twhile cur < n:\\n\\t\\ttry:\\n\\t\\t\\tif now - arr[cur] == 1:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif now - arr[cur + 1] == 2:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnow = arr[cur + 1]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcur += 2\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcount += 1\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnow = arr[cur + 1] + 1\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcur += 1\\n\\t\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnow = arr[cur] + 1\\n\\t\\texcept:\\n\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\tprint(count)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The character needs to reach the ground (height 0) from a cliff of height h. They can only move down by switching platforms using a lever. Falling more than 2 units is fatal. Crystals can be used to change the state of platforms (except the top one) to ensure safe descent.\\n- Identifying Constraints and Edge Cases: The height h and the number of platforms n can be large. The initial platform arrangement is given in descending order. The fall distance should not exceed 2. Need to handle edge cases where a direct path isn't possible and crystals are required.\\n- Developing a Strategy: Iterate through the platforms from top to bottom. If the difference between the current platform and the next is 1, check if falling to the next-next platform is safe (difference of 2). If it's not safe to proceed directly (difference > 1) or if landing directly leads to immediate unsafe fall in the next move, use a crystal to adjust the next platform's height to create a safe step.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean to switch the state of two platforms using the lever mechanism, and how does this action affect the character's position?\",\n    \"What are the conditions under which the character can safely fall from one platform to another without using a magic crystal?\",\n    \"If the character cannot directly move from one platform to the next due to a height difference greater than 1, what options are available, and how do magic crystals help?\",\n    \"How would you optimize the crystal usage to ensure the minimum number of crystals are used to reach ground level?\",\n    \"How can you simulate the platform switching using the lever to determine if a given move is safe or if crystal usage is required?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Switching states using the lever means that the current platform the character is standing on will be hidden and the platform one unit below will be moved out, effectively allowing the character to move down one level if that platform was previously hidden.\",\n    \"The character can safely fall from platform x to platform x-1 or x-2. A fall to x-3 or lower is considered fatal.\",\n    \"If the height difference between two consecutive platforms is greater than 1, the character will need to use crystals or find a different approach to reach lower platform. Crystals effectively enable moving down to intermediate platforms which can then lead to a safe descent.\",\n    \"Optimize crystal usage by checking if landing directly on next platform results in unsafe fall in the next step. if so, use crystal to make the move. Another approach is to only use crystals when no direct safe path exists.\",\n    \"Simulate the platform switching by checking the distance with next available platform in the list. If the difference is more than one then crystal usage would be required for that platform in order to proceed further. Make sure that array index are checked carefully.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
