All leaves of this tree have the same distance from the root, and for every non-leaf vertex, one of its children is the left one, and the other child is the right one. Formally, you are given a perfect binary tree.\\n\\nThe vertices of the tree are numbered in the following order:\\n\\nthe root has index $1$;\\n\\nif a vertex has index $x$, then its left child has index $2x$, and its right child has index $2x+1$.\\n\\nEvery vertex of the tree has a letter written on it, either A or B. Let's define the character on the vertex $x$ as $s_x$.\\n\\nLet the preorder string of some vertex $x$ be defined in the following way:\\n\\nif the vertex $x$ is a leaf, then the preorder string of $x$ be consisting of only one character $s_x$;\\n\\notherwise, the preorder string of $x$ is $s_x + f(l_x) + f(r_x)$, where $+$ operator defines concatenation of strings, $f(l_x)$ is the preorder string of the left child of $x$, and $f(r_x)$ is the preorder string of the right child of $x$.\\n\\nThe preorder string of the tree is the preorder string of its root.\\n\\nNow, for the problem itself...\\n\\nYou have to calculate the number of different strings that can be obtained as the preorder string of the given tree, if you are allowed to perform the following operation any number of times before constructing the preorder string of the tree:\\n\\nchoose any non-leaf vertex $x$, and swap its children (so, the left child becomes the right one, and vice versa).\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \\\\le n \\\\le 18$).\\n\\nThe second line contains a sequence of $2^n-1$ characters $s_1, s_2, \\\\dots, s_{2^n-1}$. Each character is either A or B. The characters are not separated by spaces or anything else.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of different strings that can be obtained as the preorder string of the given tree, if you can apply any number of operations described in the statement.

The goal is to find the number of distinct preorder strings achievable by swapping the left and right children of any non-leaf node any number of times.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Consider that simply generating all possible tree configurations is infeasible due to the exponential number of swaps. The crucial optimization lies in realizing that if the preorder strings of the left and right subtrees are identical, swapping them doesn't create a new string. Otherwise, it does. Modulo arithmetic is needed since the answer can be large.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Implement a recursive approach that calculates a \\\"cost\\\" for each subtree. The cost is increased by 1 if the left and right subtrees have different preorder strings. The final answer is 2 raised to the power of the total cost (modulo 998244353), representing all possible combinations of swaps that result in distinct preorder strings.\\n- Implementing In-Place Modification: Work through the tree using the given array representation. The children of node `x` are `2x` and `2x+1`. Recursively calculate the preorder string for each subtree. Use memoization to improve efficiency since the same subtree may be encountered multiple times. Compare the preorder strings of the left and right subtrees. Increment the \\\"cost\\\" if they differ. Finally, return the total cost for a given subtree.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How is the perfect binary tree represented in the input, and how can you traverse it using the given indexing scheme?\",\n    \"What does it mean to swap the children of a non-leaf vertex, and how does this affect the preorder string?\",\n    \"How can you determine if swapping the children of a vertex will result in a new, distinct preorder string?\",\n    \"What is the role of the modulo operation in the problem, and why is it necessary?\",\n    \"Can you explain the recursive approach for calculating the 'cost' of a subtree, and how the final answer is derived from these costs?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The tree is represented using an array where the root is at index 1, the left child of node x is at index 2x, and the right child is at index 2x+1.
