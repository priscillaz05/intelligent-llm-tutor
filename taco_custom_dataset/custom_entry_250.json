Each node has a (X, Y) coordinate, where X is the column and Y is the row. We need to return a list of lists, where each inner list contains the values of the nodes at a specific X coordinate, sorted from top to bottom (decreasing Y). If two nodes have the same position (X, Y), the smaller value comes first.\\n- Data Structures: A dictionary can be used to store the nodes at each column index. The keys of the dictionary will be the column indices (X coordinates), and the values will be lists of tuples, where each tuple contains the row (Y coordinate) and the node value. The lists should be sorted based on row and then value if the rows are equal.\\n- Algorithm: Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse the tree. Start at the root node (0, 0). For each node, store its value in the column dictionary, along with its row. Then, recursively traverse left child with (X-1, Y-1) and right child with (X+1, Y-1).  After the traversal is complete, the column dictionary contains all the nodes and their positions. Finally, iterate through the sorted column indices to create the final list of lists.\\n- Edge Cases: Handle the case where the input tree is empty. Also need to handle the case where the tree is not balanced.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you determine the coordinates of a node in the binary tree, and how does this affect the organization of the vertical traversal?\",\n    \"What data structure is suitable for storing and organizing the nodes based on their vertical column index and their row (Y coordinate)?\",\n    \"How can you ensure that nodes with the same coordinates are sorted correctly, specifically when they have the same X and Y coordinates but different values?\",\n    \"What is the time and space complexity of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach for traversing the tree, and can you identify potential bottlenecks?\",\n    \"How can you handle edge cases, such as an empty binary tree or a very skewed tree, to ensure the algorithm works correctly and efficiently?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The coordinates of a node are determined by the problem's definition: the root node is at (0, 0), its left child is at (X-1, Y-1), and its right child is at (X+1, Y-1). The X coordinate determines the vertical column the node belongs to, and the Y coordinate (row) determines its vertical position within that column. This dictates how we group and sort nodes.\",\n    \"A dictionary (or hash map) is suitable. The keys are the column indices (X coordinates), and the values are lists of tuples. Each tuple contains the node's row (Y coordinate) and value. This allows for efficient storage and retrieval of nodes based on their column.\",\n    \"To handle nodes with the same coordinates, the list of tuples for each column can be sorted based on the row (Y coordinate) and then the node's value. In Python, this can be done using the sorted() function with a tuple key: sorted(list_of_tuples, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1])).\",\n    \"The time complexity of the BFS approach is O(N log N), where N is the number of nodes. The space complexity is O(N), as we might store all nodes in the column dictionary. The sorting step (N log N) might be a bottleneck if the tree is very large.\",\n    \"For an empty tree, we return an empty list. For a skewed tree, the range of column indices can be very wide, potentially increasing the memory usage. However, the algorithm should still work correctly; there is no special treatment required beyond what is already implemented.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
