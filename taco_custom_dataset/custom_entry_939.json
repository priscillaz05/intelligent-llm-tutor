Also, be aware of the constraints on $l$ and $r$ ($1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le n$).\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: A brute-force approach involves iterating through all possible pairs of $l$ and $r$, calculating $c(l, r)$ for each pair, and keeping track of the pair that maximizes $r - l - c(l, r)$.\\n- Optimizing Distinct Element Counting: Consider using a set to efficiently compute the number of distinct elements $c(l, r)$ in a given subarray.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Since the constraints allow for an $O(n^3)$ approach, there's no need for complex optimizations.

Another edge case is when all elements in a given range are the same.

For each pair, calculate $c(l, r)$ as described earlier. Compute $r - l + 1 - c(l, r)$ and keep track of the indices $l$ and $r$ that yield the maximum value of this expression. The time complexity of this approach would be $O(n^3)$ because we have $O(n^2)$ pairs of $l$ and $r$ and it takes $O(n)$ time to calculate $c(l, r)$ for each pair. Note that the solution calculates r - l - c(l, r), which is similar to r - l + 1 - c(l, r) but misses the +1 term from the length of the subarray.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
