He asks each one to cook a dish and present it to him.\\nChef loves his secret ingredient, and only likes dishes with at least $X$ grams of it.\\nGiven $N$, $X$ and the amount of secret ingredient used by each student $A_i$, find out whether Chef will like at least one dish. \\n\\n-----Input:-----\\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \\n- The first line of each testcase contains two integers $N$ \\n(number of students) and $X$ (minimum amount of secret ingredient that a dish must contain for Chef to like it).\\n- The next line contains $N$ space separated integers, $A_i$ denoting the amount of secret ingredient used by the students in their dishes.\\n\\n-----Output:-----\\nFor each testcase, print a single string \\\"YES\\\" if Chef likes at least one dish. Otherwise, print \\\"NO\\\". (Without quotes).\\n\\n-----Constraints:-----\\n- $1 \\\\leq T \\\\leq 100$\\n- $1 \\\\leq N \\\\leq 1000$\\n- $1 \\\\leq X \\\\leq 1000000$\\n- $1 \\\\leq A_i \\\\leq 1000000\\n\\n-----Sample Input:-----\\n3\\n5 100\\n11 22 33 44 55\\n5 50\\n10 20 30 40 50\\n5 45\\n12 24 36 48 60\\n\\n-----Sample Output:-----\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"t = int(input())\\nfor k in range(t):\\n\\t(a, b) = map(int, input().split())\\n\\tc = list(map(int, input().split()))\\n\\tc.sort()\\n\\tif c[a - 1] >= b:\\n\\t\\tprint('YES')\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tprint('NO')\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem asks to determine if at least one student used at least X grams of the secret ingredient in their dish.\\n- Input Processing: The code first reads the number of test cases, then for each case, it reads N (number of students), X (minimum ingredient amount), and a list of ingredient amounts used by each student.\\n- Algorithm Choice: A simple approach is to iterate through the list of ingredient amounts and check if any of them are greater than or equal to X. If one is found, print \\\"YES\\\" and move to the next test case. If the loop finishes without finding any such amount, print \\\"NO\\\".\\n- Optimizations (if any): Sorting the list then checking if the largest element is greater than or equal to X would work and could be more readable.\\n- Edge Cases: Consider when no student uses enough ingredient. Also consider that N can be 1.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the main condition that needs to be satisfied to output 'YES'?\",\n    \"What happens if no student uses at least X grams of the secret ingredient?\",\n    \"What input parsing steps are required to read the values from the input correctly?\",\n    \"What is the constraint on the number of students (N) and the minimum ingredient amount (X)?\",\n    \"What if N = 1? Does the solution need to handle this special case?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"To output 'YES', at least one student's dish must contain X grams or more of the secret ingredient.\",\n    \"If no student uses at least X grams, the program must output 'NO'.\",\n    \"The input should be parsed by reading the number of test cases T, and for each test case, reading N and X, and then reading N integers representing the ingredient amounts used by each student.\",\n    \"The constraints are $1 \\\\leq N \\\\leq 1000$ and $1 \\\\leq X \\\\leq 1000000$.\",\n    \"Even if N = 1, the solution should work correctly by checking if the single student used at least X grams of the ingredient.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
