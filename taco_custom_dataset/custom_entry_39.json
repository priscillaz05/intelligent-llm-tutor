Understand that x and y are inversely proportional to a and b, respectively.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Note that x and y may not be simply a and b.  Consider how to handle cases where a and b have common factors, ensuring that x and y are the smallest possible values.  Consider time complexity constraints: O(log(max(a,b))).\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Realize that the smallest values for x and y are obtained when a and b are divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD). Thus, finding the GCD of a and b is the key step. Calculate x = b / GCD(a,b) and y = a / GCD(a,b).\\n- Implementation Considerations: Choose an efficient algorithm for calculating GCD, such as the Euclidean algorithm to meet time complexity requirement.
