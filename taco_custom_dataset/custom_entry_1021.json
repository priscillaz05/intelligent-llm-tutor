Geek wants to select three buildings in Linear Land and remodel them as recreational spots.

The goal is to determine if such a sequence exists.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: An obvious pitfall is to use a naive O(N^2) or O(N^3) solution that iterates through all possible combinations of i, j, and k, which would exceed the expected time complexity of O(N). Need to use data structures such as Stack and efficiently maintain a 'k' which represents the largest value that has been popped from the stack, indicating a potential 'arr[i]' candidate for the specified pattern.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: The provided ground truth suggests using a stack to store potential 'arr[j]' values, and iterating backwards to quickly identify valid building combinations using the previously largest popped element 'k' . This leverages the stack and a temporary variable 'k' to simulate comparison and optimize finding the buildings meeting the criteria.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Iterating the array backwards allows for efficient detection of arr[k] and arr[j], while 'k' is maintained for comparison to arr[i]\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the key requirements for selecting three buildings according to the problem statement?\",\n    \"If a naive approach of checking all possible triplets would be too slow, what alternative strategies can be adopted?\",\n    \"Can you explain how a stack could be useful in optimizing the search for such a building sequence?\",\n    \"What is the purpose of iterating the array backwards and how does it aid in optimization?\",\n    \"How does the variable 'k' in the ground truth solution relate to identifying suitable combinations of buildings?\",\n    \"Explain the time and space complexity implications of the provided solution in terms of N.\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The key requirement is to find three buildings (i, j, k) such that arr[i] < arr[k] < arr[j] where i < j < k.\",\n    \"Instead of checking all triplets, one needs an approach to precompute some information, or use techniques such as maintaining a stack or looking for patterns that reduce redundant calculations.\",\n    \"A stack could be used to keep track of potential 'arr[j]' values, which are greater than the current element being considered. This helps find a suitable 'arr[j]' in O(1) or O(log N) time rather than O(N).\",\n    \"Iterating backwards allows for efficient detection of potential 'arr[k]' and 'arr[j]' buildings by maintaining a stack and using a largest popped element 'k' for faster comparison with 'arr[i]'.\",\n    \"The variable 'k' stores the largest popped element from the stack (i.e., the largest 'arr[k]' encountered so far). If we find an 'arr[i]' that is smaller than 'k', we have found a valid combination: arr[i] < k < arr[j].\",\n    \"The expected time complexity is O(N) since it iterates through the array once. The space complexity is also O(N) due to the stack, which could potentially store all the elements of the array in the worst case.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
