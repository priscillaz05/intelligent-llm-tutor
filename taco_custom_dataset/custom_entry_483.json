Vitya is a clever boy, so he managed to finish all the tasks pretty fast and Oksana Fillipovna gave him a new one, that is much harder.\\n\\nLet's denote a flip operation of an integer as follows: number is considered in decimal notation and then reverted. If there are any leading zeroes afterwards, they are thrown away. For example, if we flip 123 the result is the integer 321, but flipping 130 we obtain 31, and by flipping 31 we come to 13.\\n\\nOksana Fillipovna picked some number a without leading zeroes, and flipped it to get number ar. Then she summed a and ar, and told Vitya the resulting value n. His goal is to find any valid a.\\n\\nAs Oksana Fillipovna picked some small integers as a and ar, Vitya managed to find the answer pretty fast and became interested in finding some general algorithm to deal with this problem. Now, he wants you to write the program that for given n finds any a without leading zeroes, such that a + ar = n or determine that such a doesn't exist.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10100 000).\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nIf there is no such positive integer a without leading zeroes that a + ar = n then print 0. Otherwise, print any valid a. If there are many possible answers, you are allowed to pick any.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nInput\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n33\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n21\\n\\nNote\\n\\nIn the first sample 4 = 2 + 2, a = 2 is the only possibility.\\n\\nIn the second sample 11 = 10 + 1, a = 10 \u2014 the only valid solution. Note, that a = 01 is incorrect, because a can't have leading zeroes.\\n\\nIt's easy to check that there is no suitable a in the third sample.\\n\\nIn the fourth sample 33 = 30 + 3 = 12 + 21, so there are three possibilities for a: a = 30, a = 12, a = 21.

We need to handle the reversing of 'a' correctly, removing leading zeros after the reversal.\\n- Handling Leading Zeros: We must ensure that 'a' does not have leading zeros. This constraint affects how we construct our answer.\\n- Edge Cases and Constraints: The input n can be very large (up to 10^100000). This rules out brute-force approaches. If no such 'a' exists, the output should be 0.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: Since n can be extremely large, it's best to process it digit by digit. We need to find digits that sum up to the digits of n when combined with their reversed counterparts, taking into account potential carry-overs.\\n- Detailed Approach: We convert n to a list of digits. Then, we iterate through the digits from both ends, trying to derive the digits of 'a'. Several cases need to be considered, especially concerning carry-overs, to find possible values for the digits of 'a' and its reversed counterpart.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the main goal of the problem and what are the key constraints we must adhere to?\",\n    \"How should we deal with the potentially large input number n, given its size?\",\n    \"How do you reverse a number and why is removing leading zeros after reversal important?\",\n    \"How can we handle carry-over values when computing the sum of a number and its reverse during the search for 'a'?\",\n    \"What conditions would indicate that no valid 'a' exists, and what should we output in that case?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The goal is to find a number 'a' such that a + reverse(a) equals the given number 'n'. The key constraints are that 'a' must not have leading zeros and if no such 'a' exists, we output 0.\",\n    \"Given that n is very large, we need to process it digit by digit rather than trying brute-force approaches involving large numbers.

Removing leading zeros after reversal is important because the problem specifies that both 'a' and reverse('a') should not have leading zeros.\",\n    \"When summing a number and its reverse, carry-over values can occur. We need to account for these carry-overs during digit-by-digit processing to determine if valid digits for 'a' exist such that their sum, along with the reverse, equals 'n'.\",\n    \"Conditions that indicate no valid 'a' exists include cases where we can't find digits of 'a' that, when added to their reversed counterparts (considering carry-overs), match the digits of 'n'.
