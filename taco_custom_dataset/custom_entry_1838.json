If there are multiple ways to achieve the result, print any.  \\nIf it is not possible to convert the array into a *good* array, print -1 instead.\\n\\nNote: A subarray of an array is formed by deletion of several (possibly zero) elements from the beginning and several (possibly zero) elements from the end of the array.\\n\\n------ Input Format ------ \\n\\n- First line will contain T, number of test cases.

The goal is to find the minimum number of subarray reversals needed to make a given array 'good'.\\n- Identifying Edge Cases: Consider cases where the array is already good (0 operations), or cases where it's impossible to make the array good (-1). Also, an array of size N.\\n- Algorithm Selection: Calculate GCD of prefixes and suffixes. Try to find the first index where GCD == 1.
