Need to read the input, determine the index of the 'MARKS' column, and then iterate through the student records to sum the marks and compute the average.\\n- Identify the Data Structures: Namedtuples could be used, but they are not necessary for a concise solution. Instead, we can find the index of the 'MARKS' column and use it to extract marks from subsequent lines using indexing.\\n- Plan the Algorithm: First, read the number of students, N. Then, read the header line and find the index of the column named 'MARKS'. Next, iterate N times, reading each student's data line and extracting the mark using the pre-determined index. Sum the marks, and after processing all students, divide the sum by N to get the average. Print the average formatted to 2 decimal places.\\n- Consider Edge Cases/Constraints: The constraints specify 0 < N <= 100. Ensure proper input reading and error handling if necessary. Since column order varies, robustly find 'MARKS' column index. Integer division issues aren't a problem here, but format output correctly.\\n- Implementing Concise Solution: The ground truth solution leverages list comprehensions and index operations for a compact implementation.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you determine the column number for 'MARKS' given that the order of columns can vary?\",\n    \"What is the best way to read the input efficiently, especially considering you need to read the number of students, the header line, and then each student's data?\",\n    \"How can you compute the average of marks collected from different input lines concisely?\",\n    \"How do you format the average marks to two decimal places as the problem requires?\",\n    \"Is using `namedtuple` necessary for this problem, and what are the alternatives for achieving the same result more directly?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Read the header line, split it into a list of column names, and use the `.index('MARKS')` method to find the index of the 'MARKS' column.\",\n    \"Use `input()` to read the number of students (N). Then use `input().split()` to read and split the header line into a list of column names. Finally, use a loop to iterate N times, using `input().split()` within the loop to read each student's data.\",\n    \"Initialize a variable to store the sum of the marks. In the loop that reads each student's data, extract the mark using the index of the 'MARKS' column and add it to the sum. After the loop, divide the sum by the total number of students (N) to compute the average.\",\n    \"Use the `print()` function with the `.format()` method or an f-string to format the average to two decimal places, e.g., `print('{:.2f}'.format(average))`.\",\n    \"No, using `namedtuple` is not necessary. You can directly use the `.split()` method to read the student's data and extract the marks using the index of the 'MARKS' column.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
