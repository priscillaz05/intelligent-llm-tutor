During Code Monk 2014 you learned that the site could support at least L people at a time without any errors, but you also know that the site can't yet support P people.\\n\\nTo determine how many more machines you'll need, you want to know within a factor of C how many people the site can support. This means that there is an integer a such that you know the site can support a people, but you know the site can't support a * C people.\\n\\nYou can run a test series of Think a Thon, each of which will determine whether the site can support at least X people for some integer value of X that you choose. If you pick an optimal strategy, choosing what tests to run based on the results of previous tests, how many Think a Thon do you need in the worst case? \\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T lines follow, each of which contains space-separated integers L, P and C in that order. \\n\\nOutput\\n\\nFor each test case, output one line containing \\\"Case #x: y\\\", where x is the case number (starting from 1) and y is the number of load tests you need to run in the worst case before knowing within a factor of C how many people the site can support.\\n\\nCONSTRAINTS\\n\\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 1000.\\n\\n2 \u2264 C \u2264 10.\\n\\nL, P and C are all integers. \\n\\n1 \u2264 L < P \u2264 109. \\n\\nSAMPLE INPUT\\n2\\n19 57 3\\n24 97 2\\n\\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\\nCase #1: 0\\nCase #2: 2\\n\\nExplanation\\n\\nIn Case #1, we already know that the site can support between 19 and 57 people. Since those are a factor of 3 apart, we don't need to do any testing. \\n\\nIn Case #2, we can test 48; but if the site can support 48 people, we need more testing, because 48*2 < 97. We could test 49; but if the site can't support 49 people, we need more testing, because 24 * 2 < 49. So we need two tests.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"noc = eval(input())\\ncs = 0\\nwhile noc:\\n\\tnoc -=1\\n\\tcs += 1\\n\\tl, p, c = list(map(int , input().split()))\\n\\tx = l\\n\\tk = 0\\n\\ti = 0\\n\\twhile x < p:\\n\\t\\tx *= c\\n\\t\\tk+=1\\n\\twhile 1 << i  < k :\\n\\t\\ti+=1\\n\\tprint(\\\"Case #%d: %d\\\" % (cs, i))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding Problem Requirements: The problem requires determining the minimum number of tests to find a value 'a' between L and P such that L <= a < P and a*C >= P. This can be found using binary search.\\n- Identifying Key Formulas: Understand that the key is to reduce the range \\[L, P] until P/L <= C. The number of tests required can be derived from ceiling(log_C(P/L)), which represents how many times L needs to be multiplied by C to reach or exceed P.\\n- Choosing an Algorithmic Strategy: A binary search strategy is not directly applicable here. The problem translates to finding k such that L * C^k >= P and then finding the minimum number of tests (i) such that 2^i >= k. This suggests iteratively multiplying L by C until it reaches P and then finding the ceiling of log2(k). Another simplification can be k = log_C(P/L), which reduces the problem to finding the base-2 logarithm required to cover k, ceiling(log2(k)).\\n- Addressing Edge Cases and Constraints: Consider cases where P/L <= C, which would result in 0 tests. Be mindful of integer division and potential rounding issues when calculating logarithms.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean to know within a factor of C how many people the site can support?\",\n    \"How can we rephrase the problem in terms of logarithms to simplify calculations?\",\n    \"What edge cases should be considered that might lead to zero tests?\",\n    \"How can we determine the number of load tests needed in the worst case?\",\n    \"How can you handle the constraints to ensure accurate results given the potentially large input values?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"It means finding a value 'a' such that the site can support 'a' people, and we know that the site cannot support 'a * C' people, where 'a' is between L and P.\",\n    \"We can rephrase the problem as finding the smallest integer k such that L * C^k >= P, and then determining the minimum number of binary tests needed to find k.\",\n    \"If P/L <= C, it means that the range between L and P is already within the factor of C, so no tests are needed.\",\n    \"The number of load tests is the ceiling of log base 2 of the smallest integer k. k can be derived from calculating the logarithm base C of P/L. Specifically, the tests needed = ceil(log2(ceil(logC(P/L))))\",\n    \"Since L, P can be up to 10^9, ensure that calculations avoid overflow by using logarithms, especially when dealing with powers. Additionally, apply integer division carefully and consider rounding issues in logarithm calculations.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
