The first feature will indicate the number of objects on a card: $1$, $2$, $3$. The second one is the color: red, green, purple. The third is the shape: oval, diamond, squiggle. The fourth is filling: open, striped, solid.\\n\\nYou can see the first three tests below. For the first two tests, the meta-sets are highlighted.\\n\\nIn the first test, the only meta-set is the five cards $(0000,\\\\ 0001,\\\\ 0002,\\\\ 0010,\\\\ 0020)$. The sets in it are the triples $(0000,\\\\ 0001,\\\\ 0002)$ and $(0000,\\\\ 0010,\\\\ 0020)$.

A 'set' consists of three cards where each feature is either the same for all three cards or pairwise distinct.  A 'meta-set' is a group of five cards containing more than one 'set'. The task is to count the number of meta-sets given n distinct cards.\\n- Identifying Key Concepts:  The core concept is the definition of a 'set'. The calculation of the 'third' card in a set given two cards is crucial.  The problem also involves combinatorics since we are dealing with selecting groups of five cards.\\n- Devising a Solution Strategy: The solution needs to efficiently identify sets among the given cards.  A crucial step is to efficiently find the potential third card, given any two cards. Since n is limited to 1000, an O(n^2) or O(n^3) approach might be viable, depending on the complexity of checking for a set. Given n cards, generating all possible 5-card combinations is likely too expensive since there are nC5 combinations, which would become too large quickly. A more reasonable strategy is to generate all possible card pairs, efficiently determine the third potential card and check if that third card exists within the input. By counting the frequency of each card appearing in sets we can identify the number of meta-sets. \\n- Optimizing the Calculation:  The calculation of the third card, based on the features of the first two cards, is a key optimization point. We must minimize the computational overhead of determining the third card in the set.\\n- Avoiding Redundant Calculations: Implement the algorithm in a way that minimizes redundant calculations and avoids overcounting the meta-sets.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you efficiently determine if three given cards form a 'set' according to the problem's definition?\",\n    \"Given two cards, how do you calculate the features of the third card that would complete a 'set', and how do you optimize this calculation?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently identify and count the number of meta-sets among the given 'n' cards, without generating all possible 5-card combinations?\",\n    \"What data structures would be most suitable to store the cards and efficiently check for the existence of a specific card?\",\n    \"How do you handle potential integer overflow issues when calculating the number of meta-sets?\",\n    \"Is it possible to define a more efficient method for set identification, potentially using bit manipulation or other techniques, considering that each feature has a value of 0, 1, or 2?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Iterate through each feature of the three cards. For each feature, check if all three values are the same or if all three values are distinct. If this condition is met for all features, the cards form a set.\",\n    \"For each feature, if the two cards have the same value, the third card must have the same value. If the two cards have different values, the third card must have the value that is different from both of them.  The calculation can be optimized by using the properties of the values 0, 1, and 2. Specifically use (x + y) % 3 to find the third value.\",\n    \"Iterate through all pairs of cards and compute the 'third' card that would complete a set. Check if this 'third' card exists within the input. For each card, keep track of how many sets it appears in.  A meta-set is any 5-card group with more than one set.  Calculate the number of meta-sets by considering combinations of sets each card is a member of. For each card, the number of meta-sets that card could belong to can be calculated by combinatorics using the frequencies of set membership. Sum these combinations over all cards. Avoid redundant calculations.\",\n    \"A dictionary or hash map can be used to efficiently store the cards and their indices. This allows for quick lookups when checking for the existence of the 'third' card. A list can be used for storage as well if lookup is not necessary\",\n    \"Since the number of sets and meta-sets can be large, use 64-bit integers or appropriate data types to prevent overflow during calculations.\",\n    \"Representing each card as a base-3 number might allow for faster computation of the third card using bitwise operations, since each value is 0,1 or 2. This approach simplifies the calculation of the third set element and avoids redundant lookups.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
