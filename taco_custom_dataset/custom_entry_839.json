The even more strange thing about him is he has an infinite number of blue and red fish. \\n\\n<image>\\n\\nHe has marked n distinct points in the plane. i-th point is point (xi, yi).

The goal is to ensure that for every horizontal and vertical line, the absolute difference between the count of red and blue fish is at most 1.\\n- Data Representation and Graph Modeling: Represent the points as nodes in a graph. Horizontal and vertical lines are implicitly defined by x and y coordinates of the points. An edge between two points indicates that they share an x or y coordinate.\\n- Balancing the Colors: The crucial part is balancing the number of red and blue fish on each line. Represent x-coordinates as positive numbers and y-coordinates as negative numbers. Build a graph where an edge exists between coordinate `u` and `v` if a point (u, -v) exists. If a coordinate appears an odd number of times, then connect to artifical nodes A, B which helps in balancing red and blue on these coordinates. If number of points with an odd number of x or y coordinate is odd, then add an edge between A and B to balance. The graph is traversed, and alternating colors are assigned. The coloring starts arbitrarily.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you model the problem as a graph?\",\n    \"How would you represent the points and the lines in the graph?\",\n    \"How do you handle cases where the number of points sharing a line is odd?\",\n    \"How does the graph traversal help in assigning colors to the fish?\",\n    \"How can you ensure the color balancing condition is met for both horizontal and vertical lines?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Each distinct x and y coordinate is a node. If there is a point (x,y), then there is an edge between node x and -y.\",\n    \"Points are represented by the coordinates (x,y) which translate into edges connecting x and -y in the graph.\",\n    \"If a coordinate appears an odd number of times, it will cause imbalance, connect these coordinates to nodes A and B.\",\n    \"By traversing the graph and alternating the colors assigned to adjacent nodes/edges, the difference in the number of red and blue fish on each line is at most 1.\",\n    \"By alternating fish color and adding edges from coordinates that appear odd number of times to artifical nodes A and B, the number of red and blue are balanced.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
