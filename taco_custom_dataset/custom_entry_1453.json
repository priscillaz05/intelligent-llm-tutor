Long a ago when the modern entertainment systems did not exist people used to go to watch plays in theaters, where people would perform live in front of an audience. There was a beautiful actress who had a disability she could not pronounce the character $'r'$. To win her favours which many have been denied in past, you decide to write a whole play without the character $'r'$. Now you have to get the script reviewed by the editor before presenting it to her.\\nThe editor was flattered by the script and agreed to you to proceed. The editor will edit the script in this way to suit her style. For each word replace it with a sub-sequence of itself such that it contains the character 'a'. \\nA subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements Wikipedia \\nNow given a script with $N$ words, for each word in the script you wish to know the number of subsequences with which it can be replaced. \\n\\n-----Input:-----\\n- First-line will contain $N$, the number of words in the script. Then next $N$ line with one test case each. \\n- Each test case contains a single word $W_i$\\n\\n-----Output:-----\\nFor each test case, output in a single line number of subsequences with which it can be replaced. \\n\\n-----Constraints-----\\n- $1 \\\\leq N \\\\leq 1000$\\n- $1 \\\\leq$ length of $W_i$  $\\\\leq 20$\\n- $W_i$  on contains lowercase english alphabets and does not have the character 'r'\\n\\n-----Sample Input 1:-----\\n2\\nabc\\naba\\n\\n-----Sample Output 1:-----\\n4\\n6\\n\\n-----EXPLANATION:-----\\nThis subsequences with which $abc$ can be replaed : ${a,ab,ac,abc}$. \\nThis subsequences with which $aba$ can be replaed : ${a,ab,aba,a,ba,a}$. \\n\\n-----Sample Input 2:-----\\n3\\nabcde\\nabcdea\\nxyz\\n\\n-----Sample Output 2:-----\\n16\\n48\\n0\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"for _ in range(int(input())):\\n\\tS = input()\\n\\tn = len(S)\\n\\ta = n - S.count('a')\\n\\tprint(2 ** n - 2 ** a)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem asks to find the number of subsequences of a given word that contain at least one 'a'. The word contains only lowercase English alphabets, but it does not contain the character 'r'.\\n- Identifying Key Insight: The total number of subsequences of a word of length n is 2^n.  The number of subsequences that do *not* contain the letter 'a' is 2^k, where k is the number of characters in the word that are *not* 'a'.  The desired result is then 2^n - 2^k.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: If a word contains no 'a's, then the number of subsequences containing 'a' is 2^n - 1 (since 2^0 = 1). If a word is empty, return 0.\\n- Algorithmic steps: Count the length of the string n. Count the number of non-'a's as k. Then return the difference between 2^n and 2^k.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you calculate the total number of subsequences for a given string?\",\n    \"How would you determine the number of subsequences that *do not* contain the letter 'a'?\",\n    \"Given the total number of subsequences and the number of subsequences that do not contain 'a', how would you calculate the number of subsequences that *do* contain 'a'?\",\n    \"What edge cases need to be considered, such as when a word has no 'a' characters?\",\n    \"How would you handle an empty input string, and what should be the expected output?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The total number of subsequences for a string of length 'n' is 2^n.\",\n    \"Count the number of characters in the word that are not 'a'. Call this 'k'. The number of subsequences that do not contain 'a' is 2^k.\",\n    \"Subtract the number of subsequences that do not contain 'a' from the total number of subsequences: 2^n - 2^k.\",\n    \"If there are no 'a' characters, then k = n, and the result is 2^n - 1. This is because an empty set is not accepted as a valid sub-sequence.\",\n    \"If the input string is empty, the number of subsequences with at least one 'a' is 0.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
