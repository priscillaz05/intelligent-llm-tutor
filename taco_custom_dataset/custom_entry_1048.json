Computers in the first row has grades $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ and in the second row \u2014 $b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$.\\n\\nInitially, all pairs of neighboring computers in each row are connected by wire (pairs $(i, i + 1)$ for all $1 \\le i < n$), so two rows form two independent computer networks.\\n\\nYour task is to combine them in one common network by connecting one or more pairs of computers from different rows. Connecting the $i$-th computer from the first row and the $j$-th computer from the second row costs $|a_i - b_j|$.\\n\\nYou can connect one computer to several other computers, but you need to provide at least a basic fault tolerance: you need to connect computers in such a way that the network stays connected, despite one of its computer failing. In other words, if one computer is broken (no matter which one), the network won't split in two or more parts.\\n\\nThat is the minimum total cost to make a fault-tolerant network?\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Next $t$ cases follow.\\n\\nThe first line of each test case contains the single integer $n$ ($3 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of computers in each row.\\n\\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the grades of computers in the first row.\\n\\nThe third line contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$ ($1 \\le b_i \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the grades of computers in the second row.\\n\\nIt's guaranteed that the total sum of $n$ doesn't exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nFor each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the minimum total cost to make a fault-tolerant network.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\n\\nInput\\n2\\n3\\n1 10 1\\n20 4 25\\n4\\n1 1 1 1\\n1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000\\nOutput\\n31\\n1999999998\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first test case, it's optimal to connect four pairs of computers:\\n\\ncomputer $1$ from the first row with computer $2$ from the second row: cost $|1 - 4| = 3$;\\n\\ncomputer $3$ from the first row with computer $2$ from the second row: cost $|1 - 4| = 3$;\\n\\ncomputer $2$ from the first row with computer $1$ from the second row: cost $|10 - 20| = 10$;\\n\\ncomputer $2$ from the first row with computer $3$ from the second row: cost $|10 - 25| = 15$;\\n\\nIn total, $3 + 3 + 10 + 15 = 31$.\\n\\nIn the second test case, it's optimal to connect $1$ from the first row with $1$ from the second row, and $4$ from the first row with $4$ from the second row.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"from bisect import bisect_right\\n\\ndef helper(ele, l1):\\n\\tind = bisect_right(l1, ele)\\n\\tif ind == len(l1):\\n\\t\\treturn abs(l1[ind - 1] - ele)\\n\\telif ind == 0:\\n\\t\\treturn abs(l1[0] - ele)\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\treturn min(abs(l1[ind - 1] - ele), abs(l1[ind] - ele))\\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\\n\\tn = int(input())\\n\\ta = [int(i) for i in input().split()]\\n\\t(a0, a1) = (a[0], a[n - 1])\\n\\tb = [int(i) for i in input().split()]\\n\\t(b0, b1) = (b[0], b[n - 1])\\n\\ta.sort()\\n\\tb.sort()\\n\\t(c1, c2, c3, c4) = (helper(a0, b), helper(a1, b), helper(b0, a), helper(b1, a))\\n\\tans = min(abs(a0 - b0) + abs(b1 - a1), abs(a1 - b0) + abs(a0 - b1))\\n\\tans = min(ans, abs(a0 - b0) + c2 + c4)\\n\\tans = min(ans, abs(a0 - b1) + c2 + c3)\\n\\tans = min(ans, abs(a1 - b1) + c1 + c3)\\n\\tans = min(ans, abs(a1 - b0) + c1 + c4)\\n\\tans = min(ans, c1 + c4 + c2 + c3)\\n\\tprint(ans)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem asks to connect two rows of computers with minimal cost, ensuring that the network remains connected even if one computer fails. The cost of connecting computers from different rows is the absolute difference of their grades.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints: The primary constraint is fault tolerance, which requires the network to stay connected even if one computer fails. The goal is to minimize the total cost of connections between the two rows.\\n- Choosing an Algorithmic Strategy: The fault tolerance requirement means there should be at least two paths between any two computers. We should consider connecting the boundary computers of each row to each other, or to the nearest elements in the other row. Consider sorting the arrays to efficiently find the nearest elements.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Evaluate all possible combinations of connections that guarantee fault tolerance, including connecting the first and last computers of each row to either corresponding computers in the other row or to the nearest element in the other row. Use helper functions to find the nearest value in a list. Ensure all combinations are evaluated and the minimum cost is taken.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for the network to be fault-tolerant in this context, and why is it important?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: Fault tolerance means that if one computer fails, the network remains connected. It's important because it ensures that the system continues to function even in the event of a single point of failure.\",\n    \"Given that fault tolerance is required, what is a minimal connection strategy that ensures the network remains connected if any one computer fails?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: A minimal connection strategy is to ensure that the first and last computer in each row are connected to at least one computer in the other row, and preferably to two computers to give fault tolerance. This is a minimum for the graph to not be disconnected by the removal of a single node.\",\n    \"How can you efficiently find the 'nearest' grade in the other row for a given computer's grade in one row?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: Sorting the arrays and using binary search (or the bisect module) allows for efficiently finding the closest grade in the other row. Alternatively, a linear search can also be implemented although it is not the optimal approach.\",\n    \"What are the various possible combinations of connections that must be considered to find the minimum cost while ensuring fault tolerance?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: We must consider connecting the first and last elements of each row with the first and last elements of the other row, and also possibly connecting them with their nearest neighbors in the other row.
