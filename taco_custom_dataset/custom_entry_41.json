The contest is divided into 2 sections-Easy and Hard. x and y marks will be awarded per problem for Easy and Hard respectively. Assume that he will take p minutes to solve an Easy problem and q minutes to solve a Hard problem successfully.\\nThere are a and b number of Easy and  Hard problems respectively. Calculate how many problems of a particular section should he perform to get the maximum score in time.\\nNote: Assume he will always try to solve the easiest problem.\\n \\nExample 1:\\nInput: n = 180, x = 2, y = 5, a = 4\\nb = 6,p = 20, q = 40\\nOutput: 1 4\\nExplanation: Maximum marks get scored \\nwhen he solves 1 easy and 4 hard problems.\\nExample 2:\\nInput: n = 50, x = 5, y = 10, a = 5 \\nb = 3, p = 10, q = 20\\nOutput: 5 0\\nExplanation : Maximum marks gets scored \\nwhen he solves 5 easy problems or 1 easy \\nand 2 hard problems or 3 easy and 1 hard \\nproblem. But he always try to solve the \\neasiest problem therefore solves 5 easy \\nproblems.\\n \\nYour Task:\\nYou don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function maximumScore() which takes n, x, y, a, b, p, and q as input parameter and returns a list which contains the total number of easy problems and hard problems required to solve to get the maximum score.\\n \\nExpected Time Complexity: O(a * b)\\nExpected Space Complexity: O(1)\\n \\nConstraints:\\n1 <= n <= 1000\\n1 <= x < y <= 100\\n1 <= a, b <= 100\\n1 <= p < q <= 100\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"class Solution:\\n\\n\\tdef maximumScore(self, n, x, y, a, b, p, q):\\n\\t\\tmax = 0\\n\\t\\tlst = [0, 0]\\n\\t\\tfor i in range(0, a + 1):\\n\\t\\t\\tfor j in range(0, b + 1):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif i * x + j * y > max and i * p + j * q <= n:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmax = i * x + j * y\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlst[0] = i\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlst[1] = j\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telif i * x + j * y == max and i * p + j * q <= n and (lst[0] < i):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlst[0] = i\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlst[1] = j\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpass\\n\\t\\treturn lst\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding Problem Requirements: The problem requires finding the combination of easy and hard problems that maximizes the total score, given constraints on the total time available, the number of available problems of each type, the points awarded per problem, and the time taken to solve each type of problem.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Need to ensure that the time taken to solve the selected problems does not exceed the total time available. Recognize that multiple combinations might yield the same maximum score, in which case, the solution should favor more easy problems.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Iterate through all possible combinations of easy and hard problems. For each combination, check if the time constraint is satisfied. If it is, calculate the score. Keep track of the maximum score and the corresponding number of easy and hard problems. If a new combination results in a higher score, update the maximum score and the corresponding numbers. If a new combination results in the same score but solves more easy problems, update the solution.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Use nested loops to iterate through all combinations of easy and hard problems. Carefully manage the score and time calculations. Pay attention to the condition when the score is the same but the number of easy problems are different.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do I determine the maximum score achievable within the time limit?\",\n    \"How should I handle cases where multiple combinations yield the same maximum score?\",\n    \"How should I iterate through all possible combinations of easy and hard problems to find the optimal solution?\",\n    \"How can I ensure that the time constraint is always satisfied while maximizing the score?\",\n    \"What are the key variables that need to be tracked during the process?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Iterate through all possible combinations of easy and hard problems, calculate the score for each combination, and keep track of the maximum score found so far, considering the time constraint.\",\n    \"If multiple combinations yield the same maximum score, choose the combination that has the largest number of easy problems, as specified in the problem statement.\",\n    \"Use nested loops, where the outer loop iterates through the number of easy problems from 0 to 'a' and the inner loop iterates through the number of hard problems from 0 to 'b'.\",\n    \"For each combination, check if the total time taken (i * p + j * q) is less than or equal to 'n'. Only calculate the score if this condition is satisfied.\",\n    \"The key variables that need to be tracked are: the current maximum score, the number of easy problems corresponding to the maximum score, and the number of hard problems corresponding to the maximum score.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
