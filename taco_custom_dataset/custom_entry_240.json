You\u2019re bored in your house and are playing golf in the hallway. \\n\\nThe hallway has $N + 2$ tiles numbered from $0$ to $N+1$ from left to right. There is a hole on tile number $x$. You hit the ball standing on tile $0$. When you hit the ball, it bounces at lengths of $k$, i.e. the tiles covered by it are $0, k, 2k, \\\\ldots$, and so on until the ball passes tile $N+1$.\\n\\nIf the ball doesn't enter the hole in the first trial, you try again but this time standing on the tile $N+1$. When you hit the ball, it bounces at lengths of $k$, i.e. the tiles covered by it are $(N + 1), (N + 1 - k), (N + 1 - 2k), \\\\ldots$, and so on until the ball passes tile $0$. \\n\\nFind if the ball will enter the hole, either in its forward journey or backward journey.\\n\\nNote: The input and output of this problem are large, so prefer using fast input/output methods.\\n\\n------ Input ------\\n\\nThe first line contains an integer $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. \\nThe only line of each test case contains three integers $N, x, k$. \\n\\n------ Output ------\\nOutput in a single line, the answer, which should be \\\"YES\\\" if the ball enters the hole either in the forward or backward journey and \\\"NO\\\" if not.\\n\\nYou may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings \\\"yEs\\\", \\\"yes\\\", \\\"Yes\\\" and \\\"YES\\\" will all be treated as identical).\\n\\n------ Constraints ------\\n$1 \u2264 T \u2264 10^{5}$\\n$1 \u2264 x, k \u2264 N \u2264 10^{9}$\\n\\n------ Subtasks ------\\nSubtask #1 (10 points): $N \u2264 10^{2}$\\n\\nSubtask #2 (90 points): original constraints\\n\\n----- Sample Input 1 ------ \\n3\\n5 4 2\\n5 3 2\\n5 5 2\\n----- Sample Output 1 ------ \\nYES\\nNO\\nNO\\n----- explanation 1 ------ \\nIn each test case, the tiles covered by the ball for $N = 5$ and $k = 2$ are $\\{0, 2, 4, 6\\}$ in the forward journey and $\\{6, 4, 2, 0\\}$ in the backward journey.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer for the first test case is \\\"YES\\\" since the ball falls in the position of the hole at tile $4$. But the answer for test cases $2$ and $3$ is \\\"NO\\\" since the ball does not fall in the position of the hole.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"for _ in range(int(input())):\\n\\t(n, x, k) = map(int, input().split())\\n\\tif x % k == 0 or x % k == (n + 1) % k:\\n\\t\\tprint('YES')\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tprint('NO')\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem describes a scenario where a golf ball is hit in a hallway with tiles numbered from 0 to N+1. The ball bounces in intervals of k. The goal is to determine if the ball will land in a hole at tile x, either when hit from tile 0 or tile N+1.\\n- Identifying Key Conditions: The ball lands on tiles 0, k, 2k,... when hit from 0. And tiles N+1, N+1-k, N+1-2k,... when hit from N+1. We need to check if x is one of these landing tiles in either direction.\\n- Devising a Test Strategy: For the forward journey, x must be a multiple of k (x % k == 0). For the backward journey, (N+1 - x) must be a multiple of k, which simplifies to x % k == (N+1) % k.\\n- Combining Conditions: If either condition is true, the ball lands in the hole. So, we check if x % k == 0 or x % k == (N+1) % k.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for the ball to land in the hole at position x, given that it bounces at intervals of k?\",\n    \"How can you determine if the hole at position x can be reached in the forward journey, starting from tile 0?\",\n    \"How can you determine if the hole at position x can be reached in the backward journey, starting from tile N+1?\",\n    \"What is the relationship between the hole's position x, the bounce length k, and the number of tiles N to determine if the ball can land in the hole?\",\n    \"What should the program output if neither the forward nor the backward journey leads to the ball landing in the hole?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"It means that x must be one of the tiles the ball lands on when bouncing at intervals of k from either the start or the end.\",\n    \"In the forward journey, x must be a multiple of k, meaning x % k == 0.\",\n    \"In the backward journey, (N+1 - x) must be a multiple of k.
