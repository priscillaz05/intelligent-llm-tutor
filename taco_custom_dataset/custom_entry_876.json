Is it possible to reorder the characters in this string to get a string with prefix \\\"LTIME\\\" and suffix \\\"EMITL\\\"?\\nWe remind you that a prefix of a string is any substring which contains its first character, while a suffix of a string is substring containing its last character.\\n\\n-----Input-----\\nThe first line contains a single integer T, denoting the number of testcases. The descriptions of T test cases follow.\\nThe first and only line of the test case description has one non-empty string S consisting of uppercase Latin letters only.\\n\\n-----Output-----\\nFor each testcase output a single line containing the string \\\"YES\\\" (without quotes) if it's possible to reorder the characters to get the required prefix and suffix, or \\\"NO\\\" (without quotes) otherwise.\\n\\n-----Constraints-----\\n- Subtask 1 (23 points) : 1 \u2264 T \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 |S| \u2264 9\\n- Subtask 2 (77 points) : 1 \u2264 T \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 |S| \u2264 100\\n\\n-----Example-----\\nInput:3\\nLTIMEAZAZAITLME\\nLLLTTTIIIMMMEEEAHA\\nLTIMEM\\n\\nOutput:YES\\nYES\\nNO\\n\\n-----Explanation-----\\nTest case 1: we can permute the last 5 letters and get LTIMEAZAZAEMITL\\nTest case 2: we have 3 copies of each of the letters 'L', 'T', 'I', 'M', 'E' so we can leave 5 of them in the beginning and move 5 of them to the end.\\nTest case 3: we have only one letter 'L' so we can't make necessary prefix and suffix at the same time.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"T = int(input())\\nfor t in range(T):\\n\\tS = input()\\n\\tletter_count = {'L': 0, 'T': 0, 'I': 0, 'M': 0, 'E': 0}\\n\\tfor c in S:\\n\\t\\tif c in letter_count:\\n\\t\\t\\tletter_count[c] += 1\\n\\tlc_list = [letter_count['L'], letter_count['T'], letter_count['I'], letter_count['M'], letter_count['E']]\\n\\tprint('YES') if all((count >= 2 for count in lc_list)) or lc_list == [2, 2, 2, 2, 1] else print('NO')\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem Requirements: The problem asks to determine if a string `S` can be rearranged to have \\\"LTIME\\\" as a prefix and \\\"EMITL\\\" as a suffix. This implies that the string `S` must contain at least the letters L, T, I, M, E at least twice each, except for when |S| == 5. If there are only 5 characters, the string must be LTIME (or EMITL reversed).\\n- Identifying Edge Cases: An edge case to consider is when the length of the string `S` is less than 5. Another edge case is that all characters must be uppercase Latin letters.\\n- Devising a Plan: Create a dictionary to store the counts of the characters L, T, I, M, and E. Iterate through the input string and increment the count of each of these characters. Then, check if each character has a count of at least 2. If the length of the string S is 5, then check if the number of counts equal one.\\n- Handling Special Cases: Handle the cases where input string S consists only of L,T,I,M,E or is less than 5.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the necessary conditions for a string to have both \\\"LTIME\\\" as a prefix and \\\"EMITL\\\" as a suffix?\",\n    \"How would you handle the edge case where the string `S` contains fewer than 5 characters?\",\n    \"What data structure would be suitable to efficiently count the occurrences of the characters L, T, I, M, and E?\",\n    \"How do you verify if all the necessary conditions are met to construct the desired prefix and suffix?\",\n    \"How to deal with when only one of each L,T,I,M,E exist?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The string must contain the characters 'L', 'T', 'I', 'M', and 'E' at least twice each to form both the prefix and the suffix, except when |S| == 5. Also, if S only contains the 5 characters L,T,I,M,E, then each only needs to exist once.\",\n    \"If the string `S` has fewer than 5 characters, it's impossible to form both the \\\"LTIME\\\" prefix and \\\"EMITL\\\" suffix, so return \\\"NO\\\".\",\n    \"A dictionary (or hash map) is a good choice because it allows you to store the counts of the characters and efficiently increment and retrieve these counts.\",\n    \"After counting the occurrences of each character, verify that the count of each character is at least 2 (except for when the length of S is 5).\",\n    \"If there is only one of each L,T,I,M,E, then the count of characters should equal one, such as when input string is \\\"LTIME\\\".\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
