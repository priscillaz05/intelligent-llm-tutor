"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"Well met with Fibonacci bigger brother, AKA Tribonacci.\\n\\nAs the name may already reveal, it works basically like a Fibonacci, but summing the last 3 (instead of 2) numbers of the sequence to generate the next. And, worse part of it, regrettably I won't get to hear non-native Italian speakers trying to pronounce it :(\\n\\nSo, if we are to start our Tribonacci sequence with `[1, 1, 1]` as a starting input (AKA *signature*), we have this sequence:\\n\\n```\\n[1, 1 ,1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, ...]\\n```\\n\\nBut what if we started with `[0, 0, 1]` as a signature? As starting with `[0, 1]` instead of `[1, 1]` basically *shifts* the common Fibonacci sequence by once place, you may be tempted to think that we would get the same sequence shifted by 2 places, but that is not the case and we would get:\\n\\n```\\n[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, ...]\\n```\\n\\nWell, you may have guessed it by now, but to be clear: you need to create a fibonacci function that given a **signature** array/list, returns **the first n elements - signature included** of the so seeded sequence.\\n\\nSignature will always contain 3 numbers; n will always be a non-negative number; if `n == 0`, then return an empty array (except in C return NULL) and be ready for anything else which is not clearly specified ;)\\n\\nIf you enjoyed this kata more advanced and generalized version of it can be found in the Xbonacci kata\\n\\n*[Personal thanks to Professor Jim Fowler on Coursera for his awesome classes that I really recommend to any math enthusiast and for showing me this mathematical curiosity too with his usual contagious passion :)]*\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def tribonacci(signature, n):\\n\\tres = signature[:n]\\n\\tfor i in range(n - 3):\\n\\t\\tres.append(sum(res[-3:]))\\n\\treturn res\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding Problem Requirements: Recognize that the task is to generate a Tribonacci sequence of length n, starting with a given signature of 3 numbers.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Consider cases where n is 0, where the function should return an empty list. Consider when n is less than 3, where you just return the first n elements of the signature.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: Utilize the given signature as the initial values of the sequence. Iterate from 3 up to n, each time summing the last three numbers to produce the next number, and append to the sequence.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Ensure that the first n elements of the signature are handled correctly and returned if n is less than or equal to 3.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the Tribonacci sequence, and how does it differ from the Fibonacci sequence?\",\n    \"What should the function return if n is 0?\",\n    \"How should the signature be used to generate the Tribonacci sequence?\",\n    \"What steps should be taken if n is less than 3?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently compute the next element in the sequence using the previous elements?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The Tribonacci sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence but sums the last three numbers to generate the next, instead of just two.\",\n    \"If n is 0, the function should return an empty list.\",\n    \"The signature provides the starting three values of the sequence.\",\n    \"If n is less than 3, return the first n elements of the signature.\",\n    \"By summing the last three elements of the current sequence and appending the result to the list.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
