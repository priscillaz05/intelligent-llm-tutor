"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"Your task is to make a program takes in a sentence (without puncuation), adds all words to a list and returns the sentence as a string which is the positions of the word in the list. Casing should not matter too.\\n\\n\\nExample\\n-----\\n\\n`\\\"Ask not what your COUNTRY can do for you ASK WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR YOUR country\\\"`\\n\\nbecomes\\n\\n`\\\"01234567802856734\\\"`\\n\\nAnother example\\n-----\\n\\n`\\\"the one bumble bee one bumble the bee\\\"`\\n\\nbecomes\\n\\n`\\\"01231203\\\"`\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def compress(sentence):\\n\\tref = []\\n\\tfor i in sentence.lower().split():\\n\\t\\tif i not in ref:\\n\\t\\t\\tref.append(i)\\n\\treturn ''.join([str(ref.index(n)) for n in sentence.lower().split()])\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires creating an index of unique words in a sentence (case-insensitive) and then representing the original sentence as a sequence of indices of these words.\\n- Data Structures: Use a list to store the unique words encountered. This list will serve as the 'dictionary' or reference.\\n- Algorithm Outline: Iterate through the words of the sentence. If a word is not in the reference list, add it. Then, transform the sentence into a string of indices, using the reference list to determine each word's index.\\n- Case Insensitivity: Convert the input sentence to lowercase to ensure consistent indexing regardless of the original casing.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you handle the case-insensitive requirement of the problem?\",\n    \"What data structure is best suited for maintaining an ordered list of unique words?\",\n    \"How would you convert the sentence to indices based on the unique word list?\",\n    \"What should be returned if the input sentence is empty?\",\n    \"How do you ensure efficiency when searching for words in the reference list?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Convert the input sentence to lowercase before processing it.\",\n    \"A list is suitable as it allows appending new words and easily retrieving the index of existing words.\",\n    \"Iterate through the split sentence, find the index of each word in the unique word list, convert it to a string, and concatenate these strings.\",\n    \"If the input sentence is empty, the function should return an empty string.\",\n    \"For smaller word lists, the `in` operator and `index` method should be sufficient. For larger datasets, a set might provide faster lookups, or consider dictionaries/hashmaps.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
