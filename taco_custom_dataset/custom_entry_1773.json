"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"Dr. Asimov, a robotics researcher, released cleaning robots he developed (see Problem B). His robots soon became very popular and he got much income. Now he is pretty rich. Wonderful.\\n\\nFirst, he renovated his house. Once his house had 9 rooms that were arranged in a square, but now his house has N \u00d7 N rooms arranged in a square likewise. Then he laid either black or white carpet on each room.\\n\\nSince still enough money remained, he decided to spend them for development of a new robot. And finally he completed.\\n\\nThe new robot operates as follows:\\n\\n* The robot is set on any of N \u00d7 N rooms, with directing any of north, east, west and south.\\n* The robot detects color of carpets of lefthand, righthand, and forehand adjacent rooms if exists. If there is exactly one room that its carpet has the same color as carpet of room where it is, the robot changes direction to and moves to and then cleans the room. Otherwise, it halts. Note that halted robot doesn't clean any longer. Following is some examples of robot's movement.\\n\\n<image>\\n\\nFigure 1. An example of the room\\n\\n\\nIn Figure 1,\\n* robot that is on room (1,1) and directing north directs east and goes to (1,2).\\n* robot that is on room (0,2) and directing north directs west and goes to (0,1).\\n* robot that is on room (0,0) and directing west halts.\\n* Since the robot powered by contactless battery chargers that are installed in every rooms, unlike the previous robot, it never stops because of running down of its battery. It keeps working until it halts.\\n\\n\\n\\nDoctor's house has become larger by the renovation. Therefore, it is not efficient to let only one robot clean. Fortunately, he still has enough budget. So he decided to make a number of same robots and let them clean simultaneously.\\n\\nThe robots interacts as follows:\\n\\n* No two robots can be set on same room.\\n* It is still possible for a robot to detect a color of carpet of a room even if the room is occupied by another robot.\\n* All robots go ahead simultaneously.\\n* When robots collide (namely, two or more robots are in a single room, or two robots exchange their position after movement), they all halt. Working robots can take such halted robot away.\\n\\n\\nOn every room dust stacks slowly but constantly. To keep his house pure, he wants his robots to work so that dust that stacked on any room at any time will eventually be cleaned.\\n\\nAfter thinking deeply, he realized that there exists a carpet layout such that no matter how initial placements of robots are, this condition never can be satisfied. Your task is to output carpet layout that there exists at least one initial placements of robots that meets above condition. Since there may be two or more such layouts, please output the K-th one lexicographically.\\n\\nConstraints\\n\\n* Judge data consists of at most 100 data sets.\\n* 1 \u2264 N < 64\\n* 1 \u2264 K < 263\\n\\nInput\\n\\nInput file contains several data sets. One data set is given in following format:\\n\\n\\nN K\\n\\n\\nHere, N and K are integers that are explained in the problem description.\\n\\nThe end of input is described by a case where N = K = 0. You should output nothing for this case.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nPrint the K-th carpet layout if exists, \\\"No\\\" (without quotes) otherwise.\\n\\nThe carpet layout is denoted by N lines of string that each has exactly N letters. A room with black carpet and a room with white carpet is denoted by a letter 'E' and '.' respectively. Lexicographically order of carpet layout is defined as that of a string that is obtained by concatenating the first row, the second row, ..., and the N-th row in this order.\\n\\nOutput a blank line after each data set.\\n\\nExample\\n\\nInput\\n\\n2 1\\n2 3\\n6 4\\n0 0\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n..\\n..\\n\\nNo\\n\\n..EEEE\\n..E..E\\nEEE..E\\nE..EEE\\nE..E..\\nEEEE..\\n\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"mv = ((-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1))\\nd2c = {0: '.', 1: 'E'}\\nwhile True:\\n\\t(n, k) = map(int, input().split())\\n\\tif n == 0:\\n\\t\\tbreak\\n\\t(k, n1) = (k - 1, n - 1)\\n\\tif n & 1 or k >= 1 << (n >> 1):\\n\\t\\tprint('No\\\\n')\\n\\t\\tcontinue\\n\\tarr = [[-1 for c in range(n)] for r in range(n)]\\n\\tfor c in range(n):\\n\\t\\tarr[0][c] = k >> (n1 - c >> 1) & 1\\n\\tfor r in range(n1):\\n\\t\\tfor c in range(n):\\n\\t\\t\\t(f, t) = (0, arr[r][c])\\n\\t\\t\\tfor i in range(4):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(nr, nc) = (r + mv[i][0], c + mv[i][1])\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif nr >= 0 and nr < n and (nc >= 0) and (nc < n) and (arr[nr][nc] == t):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tf += 1\\n\\t\\t\\tarr[r + 1][c] = 1 - t if f == 2 else t\\n\\tfor r in range(n):\\n\\t\\tprint(''.join([d2c[arr[r][c]] for c in range(n)]))\\n\\tprint()\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem describes a scenario with cleaning robots in an NxN grid of rooms with black ('E') or white ('.') carpets. The robots move based on the colors of adjacent rooms and halt under specific conditions (no unique matching color or collision). The goal is to find the K-th lexicographical carpet layout such that there is at least one initial robot placement that prevents all dust from eventually being cleaned.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints and Edge Cases: N is between 1 and 63 inclusive, K is between 1 and 2^63. Need to handle the case when no solution exists. Lexicographical order of layouts matters.\\n- Devising a Solution Strategy: The ground truth solution leverages a pattern-based approach. The key insight is to generate the carpet layout directly based on N and K. This involves checking if N is even, and if K is within a certain range. If not, there's no solution. If a solution exists, generate the first row based on bits of K and then derive subsequent rows using a logical rule related to adjacent cells.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for the K-th carpet layout to prevent all dust from being cleaned, and how does this relate to robot movement?\",\n    \"What are the constraints on N and K, and how do these constraints affect the existence of a solution?\",\n    \"How do you determine the K-th carpet layout lexicographically? What does the term 'lexicographically' mean in the context of this problem?\",\n    \"Given N and K, how do you determine the color of each room in the carpet layout?\",\n    \"What conditions lead to a 'No' solution? What is the logic behind these conditions?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"It means there's at least one possible placement of robots such that some room(s) will never be visited and cleaned by a robot. It relies on understanding the robot's movement rules and finding static patterns of carpet colors where the robots get stuck or enter infinite loops without covering all the rooms.\",\n    \"N is the size of the grid (1 <= N < 64), and K is the index of the layout to be generated (1 <= K < 2^63). If N is odd or K is beyond a certain threshold (K >= 1 << (N >> 1)), then a solution (a valid carpet layout with the described property) doesn't exist.\",\n    \"Lexicographically means ordering the layouts as if they were strings. The first row is compared first, then the second row, and so on. A layout A is considered 'smaller' than a layout B if the string representation of A comes before the string representation of B in a dictionary.\",\n    \"The ground truth solution suggests using the binary representation of K to generate the first row of the layout. Specifically, the c-th element of the first row equals k >> (n1 - c >> 1) & 1 where n1 = n-1.  Subsequent rows are then derived row by row based on a pattern of the adjacent rooms. The provided solution derives other rows by checking adjacent cells in the above rows. If a room has exactly one adjacent room of the same color as itself, it will have the opposite color, otherwise it will have the same color.\",\n    \"A 'No' solution exists if N is odd or if K >= 1 << (N >> 1).  The condition involving N prevents dust from being removed at specific points, and the one involving K makes sure you are within the valid set of permutations to use.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
