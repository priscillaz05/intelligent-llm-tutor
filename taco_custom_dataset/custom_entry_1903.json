For example, strings \\\"pop\\\", \\\"noon\\\", \\\"x\\\", and \\\"kkkkkk\\\" are palindromes, while strings \\\"moon\\\", \\\"tv\\\", and \\\"abab\\\" are not. An empty string is also a palindrome.\\n\\nGildong loves this concept so much, so he wants to play with it. He has $n$ distinct strings of equal length $m$. He wants to discard some of the strings (possibly none or all) and reorder the remaining strings so that the concatenation becomes a palindrome. He also wants the palindrome to be as long as possible. Please help him find one.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$, $1 \\\\le m \\\\le 50$) \u2014 the number of strings and the length of each string.\\n\\nNext $n$ lines contain a string of length $m$ each, consisting of lowercase Latin letters only. All strings are distinct.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nIn the first line, print the length of the longest palindrome string you made.\\n\\nIn the second line, print that palindrome. If there are multiple answers, print any one of them. If the palindrome is empty, print an empty line or don't print this line at all.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n3 3\\ntab\\none\\nbat\\n\\nOutput\\n6\\ntabbat\\n\\nInput\\n4 2\\noo\\nox\\nxo\\nxx\\n\\nOutput\\n6\\noxxxxo\\n\\nInput\\n3 5\\nhello\\ncodef\\norces\\n\\nOutput\\n0\\n\\n\\nInput\\n9 4\\nabab\\nbaba\\nabcd\\nbcde\\ncdef\\ndefg\\nwxyz\\nzyxw\\nijji\\n\\nOutput\\n20\\nababwxyzijjizyxwbaba\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first example, \\\"battab\\\" is also a valid answer.\\n\\nIn the second example, there can be 4 different valid answers including the sample output.

Each string has the same length, and all strings are distinct.\\n- Identifying the key idea: A palindrome can be constructed by concatenating pairs of strings that are reverses of each other, plus optionally a single palindrome string in the middle.\\n- Algorithm selection: Iterate through the strings, pairing up strings that are reverses of each other. For each pair, add the string to the left part of the palindrome. After pairing, check if there are any palindrome strings left. Add one to the middle if present.\\n- Implementation details: Use a dictionary to store the strings and their counts. Iterate through the strings, and for each string, check if its reverse exists in the dictionary. If it does, add the string to the left part of the palindrome and decrement the counts of both strings. After the pairing, iterate through the dictionary to find a palindrome string with count > 0. Add it to the middle of the palindrome. Finally, construct the palindrome by concatenating the left part, the middle part (if any), and the reverse of the left part.\\n- Edge cases: If no palindrome can be formed, return 0.
