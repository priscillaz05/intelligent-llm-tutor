"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"Daisy is a senior software engineer at RainyDay, LLC. She has just implemented three new features in their product: the first feature makes their product work, the second one makes their product fast, and the third one makes their product correct. The company encourages at least some testing of new features, so Daisy appointed her intern Demid to write some tests for the new features.\\n\\nInterestingly enough, these three features pass all the tests on Demid's development server, which has index 1, but might fail the tests on some other servers.\\n\\nAfter Demid has completed this task, Daisy appointed you to deploy these three features to all n servers of your company. For every feature f and every server s, Daisy told you whether she wants the feature f to be deployed on the server s. If she wants it to be deployed, it must be done even if the feature f fails the tests on the server s. If she does not want it to be deployed, you may not deploy it there.\\n\\nYour company has two important instruments for the deployment of new features to servers: Continuous Deployment (CD) and Continuous Testing (CT). CD can be established between several pairs of servers, forming a directed graph. CT can be set up on some set of servers.\\n\\nIf CD is configured from the server s_1 to the server s_2 then every time s_1 receives a new feature f the system starts the following deployment process of f to s_2:\\n\\n  * If the feature f is already deployed on the server s_2, then nothing is done. \\n  * Otherwise, if CT is not set up on the server s_1, then the server s_1 just deploys the feature f to the server s_2 without any testing. \\n  * Otherwise, the server s_1 runs tests for the feature f. If the tests fail on the server s_1, nothing is done. If the tests pass, then the server s_1 deploys the feature f to the server s_2. \\n\\n\\nYou are to configure the CD/CT system, and after that Demid will deploy all three features on his development server. Your CD/CT system must deploy each feature exactly to the set of servers that Daisy wants.\\n\\nYour company does not have a lot of computing resources, so you can establish CD from one server to another at most 264 times.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line contains integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 256) \u2014 the number of servers in your company.\\n\\nNext n lines contain three integers each. The j-th integer in the i-th line is 1 if Daisy wants the j-th feature to be deployed to the i-th server, or 0 otherwise.\\n\\nNext n lines contain three integers each. The j-th integer in the i-th line is 1 if tests pass for the j-th feature on the i-th server, or 0 otherwise.\\n\\nDemid's development server has index 1. It is guaranteed that Daisy wants all three features to be deployed to the server number 1, and all three features pass their tests on the server number 1.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nIf it is impossible to configure CD/CT system with CD being set up between at most 264 pairs of servers, then output the single line \\\"Impossible\\\".\\n\\nOtherwise, the first line of the output must contain the line \\\"Possible\\\".\\n\\nNext line must contain n space-separated integers \u2014 the configuration of CT. The i-th integer should be 1 if you set up CT on the i-th server, or 0 otherwise.\\n\\nNext line must contain the integer m (0 \u2264 m \u2264 264) \u2014 the number of CD pairs you want to set up.\\n\\nEach of the next m lines must describe CD configuration, each line with two integers s_i and t_i (1 \u2264 s_i, t_i \u2264 n; s_i \u2260 t_i), establishing automated deployment of new features from the server s_i to the server t_i).\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nInput\\n\\n\\n3\\n1 1 1\\n1 0 1\\n1 1 1\\n1 1 1\\n0 0 0\\n1 0 1\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n\\nPossible\\n1 1 1\\n2\\n3 2\\n1 3\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n\\n2\\n1 1 1\\n0 0 1\\n1 1 1\\n1 1 0\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n\\nImpossible\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import sys\\nfrom functools import reduce\\n\\ndef impossible():\\n\\tprint('Impossible')\\n\\ndef main_proc():\\n\\tres = []\\n\\tcnt2resolve = 0\\n\\tn = int(input())\\n\\ttarget = [[[], []] for _ in range(8)]\\n\\ttest = [0 for _ in range(8)]\\n\\ttest[7] = 1\\n\\tsrc = [[] for _ in range(0, n + 1)]\\n\\tct = ['1' for _ in range(0, n + 1)]\\n\\tinput()\\n\\tfor i in range(2, n + 1):\\n\\t\\tind = reduce(lambda a, b: (a << 1) + int(b), [int(_) for _ in input().split()])\\n\\t\\tsrc[i].append(ind)\\n\\t\\ttarget[ind][1].append(i)\\n\\ttarget[0][1] = []\\n\\tfor x in target:\\n\\t\\tif len(x[1]):\\n\\t\\t\\tcnt2resolve += 1\\n\\tinput()\\n\\tfor i in range(2, n + 1):\\n\\t\\tind = reduce(lambda a, b: (a << 1) + int(b), [int(_) for _ in input().split()])\\n\\t\\tind &= src[i][0]\\n\\t\\tsrc[i].append(ind)\\n\\tfor i in (7, 6, 5, 3, 4, 2, 1):\\n\\t\\tif not target[i][0] and target[i][1]:\\n\\t\\t\\tfor j in target[i][1]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif test[src[j][0]]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tif not target[i][0]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttarget[i][0].append(test[src[j][0]])\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcnt2resolve -= 1\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttest[src[j][1]] = j\\n\\tif cnt2resolve:\\n\\t\\tfor i in (6, 5, 3):\\n\\t\\t\\tif not target[i][0] and target[i][1]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttmp = 2\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor j in (4, 2, 1):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tif j & i:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tif test[j]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tif src[test[j]][0] in (4, 2, 1):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttarget[i][0].append(target[src[test[j]][0]][0][0])\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttarget[i][0].append(test[j])\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttmp -= 1\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif not tmp:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcnt2resolve -= 1\\n\\tif not cnt2resolve:\\n\\t\\tfor i in range(7, 0, -1):\\n\\t\\t\\tfor k in target[i][0]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif len(target[i][0]) == 2:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttt = target[i][1][:1]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttt = target[i][1]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor j in tt:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tres.append(' '.join((str(k), str(j))))\\n\\t\\t\\tif len(target[i][0]) == 2 and len(target[i][1]) > 1:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thp = target[i][1][0]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tct[hp] = '0'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor j in target[i][1][1:]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tres.append(' '.join((str(hp), str(j))))\\n\\t\\tprint('Possible')\\n\\t\\tprint(' '.join(ct[1:]))\\n\\t\\tprint(len(res))\\n\\t\\tprint('\\\\n'.join(res))\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tprint('Impossible')\\n\\treturn\\nmain_proc()\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem describes a scenario where features need to be deployed to servers based on Daisy's specifications, using Continuous Deployment (CD) and Continuous Testing (CT). The goal is to determine a CD/CT configuration that meets Daisy's deployment requirements.\\n- Data Representation: Representing which features should be on each server and whether tests pass on each server are crucial. Using bitwise operations can compactly store these feature deployment and test results.\\n- Building the Deployment Graph: The core of the solution lies in constructing the correct CD graph and CT settings to satisfy the deployment constraints. This requires careful consideration of how CD and CT interact.\\n- Handling the \\\"Impossible\\\" Case: The code checks for conditions that would make the configuration impossible to achieve. This check needs to comprehensively cover scenarios where Daisy's specifications cannot be met regardless of CD/CT settings.\\n- Outputting the Solution: When a solution is possible, the code generates the CT configuration and CD pairs. It ensures the output format matches the required specification.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you represent the feature deployment requirements and test results efficiently, considering each server has three features?\",\n    \"How do you determine the CT settings for each server to ensure features are deployed according to Daisy's specifications?\",\n    \"What is the strategy for creating the CD graph, and how do you determine the connections between servers?\",\n    \"How can you identify and handle cases where it's impossible to meet Daisy's deployment requirements?\",\n    \"Given a possible solution, what steps are required to output the CT configuration and CD pairs in the correct format?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Use a bitmask to represent which features should be deployed to a server and which tests pass on it. Each bit in the mask corresponds to a feature. For example, 111 (binary) means all three features should be deployed/pass tests, while 101 means only the first and third.\",\n    \"Initially, set CT to 1 for all servers. Then, based on the target feature set and test results, selectively disable CT on some servers to ensure that features are only deployed if either CT is disabled or the tests pass.\",\n    \"Iterate through the servers and features. If a server needs a feature but fails the test, create a CD link from a server where the test passes. Prioritize using Demid's development server (server 1) as the source for CD if possible.\",\n    \"A configuration is impossible if a server requires a feature, its tests fail, and there's no other server with the feature passing tests that can serve as a source for CD. Exhaustively check for such scenarios before attempting to build the graph.\",\n    \"First, print \\\"Possible\\\". Then, print the CT settings as a space-separated list of 0s and 1s. Next, print the number of CD pairs (m). Finally, print each CD pair (source server, target server) on a new line.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
