He adds `1` plant on the first morning and on the third morning there would be `4` plants in the garden. He then adds `1` more and sees `5` plants. \\n \\n So, Lonerz only needs to add 2 plants to his garden.\\n \\n For `n = 8,` the output should be `1`.\\n \\n Lonerz hopes to see `8` plants. Thus, he just needs to add `1` plant in the beginning and wait for it to double till 8.\\n \\n# Input/Output\\n\\n The number of plant lonerz hopes to see in his garden.\\n \\n \\n - `[input]` integer `n`\\n \\n   `1 <= n <= 10^7`\\n\\n\\n - `[output]` an integer\\n\\n The number of plants Lonerz needs to plant.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def plant_doubling(n):\\n\\treturn bin(n).count('1')\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem asks for the minimum number of times Lonerz needs to add plants to the garden such that, through a series of doublings and additions, the garden eventually contains 'n' plants.\\n- Identifying the Core Idea: Realize that each plant added can double each night. The minimum number of plants needed corresponds to the number of '1's in the binary representation of 'n'. This is because each '1' represents a plant that Lonerz needs to initially plant, and then this plant doubles until it reaches the appropriate power of 2 to contribute to the total 'n' plants.\\n- Algorithmic Approach: Convert the number 'n' into its binary representation. Count the number of '1's in the binary string. This count represents the minimum number of plants Lonerz must initially add.\\n- Implementation: Use built-in functions in the programming language of choice to convert the integer to its binary equivalent and count the '1's.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does the doubling of plants each night imply about the powers of 2?\",\n    \"How does the binary representation of 'n' relate to the number of initial plants needed?\",\n    \"Can you explain why counting the '1's in the binary representation gives us the minimum number of plants?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases for this problem, and how does the solution handle them?\",\n    \"If n=10, what is the binary representation, and how many plants are needed according to the binary representation?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The doubling of plants each night implies that any number of plants 'x' planted on day 'i' will result in x * 2^(number of nights) plants.\",\n    \"The binary representation of 'n' shows how 'n' can be expressed as a sum of powers of 2. Each '1' in the binary form corresponds to a power of 2 that's included in the sum. These powers of 2 represent the result of initially planting 1 plant and allowing it to double over several nights. The number of '1's indicates how many plants were initially added at some point.\",\n    \"Counting the '1's is the minimum because each '1' corresponds to a plant that doubles to reach a specific power of 2. If we tried to achieve 'n' with fewer initial plants, we wouldn't be able to sum up the correct powers of 2 to reach 'n'.\",\n    \"The problem states 1 <= n <= 10^7 so n is always a positive number, including 1. There is no need for special handling.\",\n    \"If n=10, the binary representation is '1010'. There are two '1's in this representation, so the answer should be 2.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
