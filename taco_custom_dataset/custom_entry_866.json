"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"Tired of those repetitive javascript challenges? Here's a unique hackish one that should keep you busy for a while ;)\\n\\nThere's a mystery function which is already available for you to use. It's a simple function called `mystery`. It accepts a string as a parameter and outputs a string. The exercise depends on guessing what this function actually does.\\n\\nYou can call the mystery function like this:\\n\\n```python\\nmy_output = mystery(\\\"my_input\\\")\\n```\\n\\nUsing your own test cases, try to call the mystery function with different input strings and try to analyze its output in order to guess what is does. You are free to call the mystery function in your own test cases however you want.\\n\\nWhen you think you've understood how my mystery function works, prove it by reimplementing its logic in a function that you should call 'solved(x)'. To validate your code, your function 'solved' should return the same output as my function 'mystery' given the same inputs.\\n\\nBeware! Passing your own test cases doesn't imply you'll pass mine.\\n\\nCheaters are welcome :)\\n\\nHave fun!\\n\\n---\\n\\nToo easy? Then this kata will totally blow your mind:\\n\\nhttp://www.codewars.com/kata/mystery-function-number-2\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def solved(s):\\n\\tif len(s) & 1:\\n\\t\\ts = s[:len(s) // 2] + s[len(s) // 2 + 1:]\\n\\treturn ''.join(sorted(s))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The core task is to reverse engineer a function named `mystery(s)` and then replicate its functionality in a function called `solved(s)`. We need to call `mystery` with different inputs, analyze the outputs, and deduce the algorithm. Then, implement `solved` to produce identical outputs for the same inputs.\\n- Identifying Potential Approaches: Start by calling the mystery function with different types of strings (empty, single characters, multiple characters, palindromes, strings with repeated characters, strings with different data types etc.) and analyze how the output changes. Look for patterns like sorting, character removal, reversing, etc.\\n- Hypothesizing and Testing: Formulate hypotheses about what the `mystery` function does based on the observed inputs and outputs. Write test cases to validate these hypotheses by comparing the output of the `mystery` function and your hypothesized logic.\\n- Implementing the `solved` function: Once you've confidently deduced the `mystery` function, write the `solved` function to replicate the same steps. Focus on edge cases and ensuring the outputs match exactly.\\n- Validation: Thoroughly test the `solved` function against a variety of test cases, including those provided and self-generated ones. Compare the outputs of `mystery` and `solved` for each test case. Address any discrepancies by refining the logic of the `solved` function.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are some different types of strings that should be used as inputs to test the `mystery` function, and why?\",\n    \"How do you analyze the outputs of the `mystery` function to find patterns or transformations?\",\n    \"What are some initial hypotheses about the purpose of the `mystery` function based on a limited number of tests?\",\n    \"After writing the `solved` function, what are the most critical validation steps to ensure it's correct?\",\n    \"What edge cases or specific inputs might expose flaws in the logic of the `solved` function?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Empty strings, single characters, strings with repeated characters, strings with different data types, palindromes, strings with odd/even lengths.\",\n    \"Look for character sorting, reversing, removal, or encryption-like behavior. Also note any special handling of specific characters.\",\n    \"The mystery function might sort characters, remove duplicates, reverse strings, or perform simple encryption.\",\n    \"Thoroughly testing against a wide range of inputs and edge cases, comparing the results from `mystery` to the results from `solved`.\",\n    \"Strings with special characters, very long strings, inputs that result in empty strings after any transformations.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
