But there is a problem, You don't know how many students are present today.\\nThe students have gathered of the morning assembly in $R$ rows and $C$ columns. Now you have to calculate how many cakes you have to make such that each child gets a cupcake. \\n\\n-----Input:-----\\n- First-line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. \\n- Each test case contains a single line of input, two integers $R$ and $C$. \\n\\n-----Output:-----\\nFor each test case, output number of cupcakes you have to make.\\n\\n-----Constraints-----\\n- $1 \\\\leq T \\\\leq 1000$\\n- $2 \\\\leq R,C \\\\leq 10^6$\\n\\n-----Sample Input:-----\\n1\\n5 10\\n\\n-----Sample Output:-----\\n50\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"for _ in range(int(input())):\\n\\tn = list(map(int, input().split()))\\n\\tprint(n[0] * n[1])\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: Recognize that the problem asks to calculate the total number of students given the number of rows and columns they are arranged in.\\n- Identifying Key Information: Note that R represents the number of rows and C represents the number of columns.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Realize that the total number of students is simply the product of the number of rows and the number of columns.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Determine how to handle multiple test cases and how to read the input correctly.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the relationship between the number of rows, number of columns, and the total number of students?\",\n    \"How should the input be read when there are multiple test cases?\",\n    \"Given the constraints for R and C, what is the possible range for the number of cupcakes that need to be made?\",\n    \"What are the potential edge cases and how would you handle them?\",\n    \"What is the mathematical operation required to calculate the total number of students?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The total number of students is the product of the number of rows and the number of columns.\",\n    \"The input should be read within a loop that iterates T times, where T is the number of test cases.\",\n    \"Since 2 <= R,C <= 10^6, the number of cupcakes will be between 4 and 10^12.\",\n    \"There are no significant edge cases given the constraints.
