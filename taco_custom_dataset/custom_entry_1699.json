The XOR operation should be performed iteratively from index a to index b (inclusive).\\n- Implementing XOR Calculation: Iterate through the array from index a to b. In each iteration, XOR the current element with the accumulated XOR result. Initialize the XOR result to 0.\\n- Handling Constraints and Edge Cases: Ensure a and b are within the valid index range of the array. The constraints 0 \u2264 a \u2264 b < n should be verified implicitly by the problem definition. No explicit error handling is required.\\n- Returning the Result: After iterating through the specified range, return the final XOR result.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does the XOR operation do, and how does it affect the bits of the numbers involved?\",\n    \"How do you iterate through the range of elements specified by indices a and b in the array?\",\n    \"What should the initial value of the XOR accumulator be before starting the iteration?\",\n    \"How should the XOR operation be applied iteratively as you move through the array elements from index a to b?\",\n    \"Given the constraints 0 \u2264 a \u2264 b < n, what potential issues could arise with the input indices, and how might they affect the algorithm?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The XOR (exclusive OR) operation compares the corresponding bits of two numbers.
