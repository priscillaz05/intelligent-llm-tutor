In one of his favourite computer games Petya reached the final level where a fight with the boss take place.\\n\\nWhile playing the game Petya found spell scrolls and now he is about to use them. Let\u2019s describe the way fighting goes on this level:\\n\\n1) The boss has two parameters: max \u2014 the initial amount of health and reg \u2014 regeneration rate per second.\\n\\n2) Every scroll also has two parameters: powi \u2014 spell power measured in percents \u2014 the maximal amount of health counted off the initial one, which allows to use the scroll (i.e. if the boss has more than powi percent of health the scroll cannot be used); and dmgi the damage per second inflicted upon the boss if the scroll is used. As soon as a scroll is used it disappears and another spell is cast upon the boss that inflicts dmgi of damage per second upon him until the end of the game.\\n\\nDuring the battle the actions per second are performed in the following order: first the boss gets the damage from all the spells cast upon him, then he regenerates reg of health (at the same time he can\u2019t have more than max of health), then the player may use another scroll (no more than one per second).\\n\\nThe boss is considered to be defeated if at the end of a second he has nonpositive ( \u2264 0) amount of health.\\n\\nHelp Petya to determine whether he can win with the set of scrolls available to him and if he can, determine the minimal number of seconds he needs to do it.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line contains three integers N, max and reg (1 \u2264 N, max, reg \u2264 1000) \u2013\u2013 the amount of scrolls and the parameters of the boss. The next N lines contain two integers powi and dmgi each \u2014 the parameters of the i-th scroll (0 \u2264 powi \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 dmgi \u2264 2000). \\n\\nOutput\\n\\nIn case Petya can\u2019t complete this level, output in the single line NO.\\n\\nOtherwise, output on the first line YES. On the second line output the minimal time after which the boss can be defeated and the number of used scrolls. In the next lines for each used scroll output space-separated number of seconds passed from the start of the battle to the moment the scroll was used and the number of the scroll. Scrolls are numbered starting from 1 in the input order. The first scroll is considered to be available to be used after 0 seconds.\\n\\nOutput scrolls in the order they were used.\\nIt is not allowed to use scrolls after the boss is defeated.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nInput\\n\\n2 10 3\\n100 3\\n99 1\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nNO\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n2 100 10\\n100 11\\n90 9\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nYES\\n19 2\\n0 1\\n10 2\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"class Scroll:\\n\\n\\tdef __init__(self, id, power, damage):\\n\\t\\tself.id = id\\n\\t\\tself.power = power\\n\\t\\tself.damage = damage\\n\\t\\tself.active = False\\n(num_scrolls, boss_max, regenerate) = map(int, input().split())\\nscrolls = [Scroll(i + 1, *map(int, input().split())) for i in range(num_scrolls)]\\nscrolls.sort(key=lambda scroll: -scroll.damage)\\nboss_curr = boss_max\\nscroll_damage = 0\\nactive_scrolls = []\\ntick = 0\\nwhile True:\\n\\tboss_prev = boss_curr\\n\\tboss_curr -= scroll_damage\\n\\tboss_curr = min(boss_max, boss_curr + regenerate)\\n\\tif boss_curr <= 0:\\n\\t\\tprint('YES')\\n\\t\\tprint(tick, len(active_scrolls))\\n\\t\\tfor scroll in active_scrolls:\\n\\t\\t\\tprint(scroll.start, scroll.id)\\n\\t\\tbreak\\n\\tfound = False\\n\\tfor scroll in scrolls:\\n\\t\\tif not scroll.active and 100 * boss_curr <= scroll.power * boss_max:\\n\\t\\t\\tscroll.start = tick\\n\\t\\t\\tscroll.active = True\\n\\t\\t\\tactive_scrolls.append(scroll)\\n\\t\\t\\tscroll_damage += scroll.damage\\n\\t\\t\\tfound = True\\n\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\tif not found and boss_curr >= boss_prev:\\n\\t\\tprint('NO')\\n\\t\\tbreak\\n\\ttick += 1\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem describes a boss fight in a game where the player uses scrolls to defeat the boss. The boss has initial health (`max`) and regenerates health each second (`reg`). Each scroll has a power (`powi`) (percentage of `max` health) and damage (`dmgi`).\\n- Defining Constraints: The boss is defeated when its health is non-positive. A scroll can only be used if the boss's current health is less than or equal to the scroll's power (percentage of max health). Only one scroll can be used per second. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds to defeat the boss and the order of scrolls used.\\n- Formulating a Strategy: Simulate the battle second by second. At each second, calculate the damage inflicted, the boss's regeneration, and then decide whether to use a scroll. The scrolls should be sorted by damage to maximize effectiveness. If no scroll can be used and the boss isn't taking damage, it means the player cannot win.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: If the boss's health stays the same and no scrolls are available, the player loses. Also, need to account for the boss not exceeding the max health amount.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does the boss's health regeneration work, and how does it interact with the damage inflicted by the scrolls?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: The boss regenerates `reg` health each second, up to the initial `max` health. First, damage from active scrolls is applied. Then the boss regenerates, and its health is capped at `max`.\",\n    \"How is the eligibility of a scroll determined, and what happens when a scroll is used?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: A scroll is eligible if the boss's current health is less than or equal to `powi` percent of `max` health. When a scroll is used, its damage is added to the total damage inflicted on the boss each second, and the scroll cannot be used again.\",\n    \"What happens if no scroll can be used and the boss's health either increases or stays the same?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: This means the player cannot defeat the boss, as no further damage can be applied.\",\n    \"How should the scrolls be used to defeat the boss in the shortest amount of time?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: The scrolls should be sorted in descending order of damage, so that the scrolls dealing the most damage are always used first to defeat the boss most efficiently.\",\n    \"How would the code correctly track the scrolls used and at what tick?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: A list needs to store each scroll used and the current tick the scroll was used. Also, we need to check that scrolls are not used after the boss's health is nonpositive.\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Expected Answer: The boss regenerates `reg` health each second, up to the initial `max` health.
