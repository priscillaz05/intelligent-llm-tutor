"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"Friends are going to play console. They have two joysticks and only one charger for them. Initially first joystick is charged at a_1 percent and second one is charged at a_2 percent. You can connect charger to a joystick only at the beginning of each minute. In one minute joystick either discharges by 2 percent (if not connected to a charger) or charges by 1 percent (if connected to a charger).\\n\\nGame continues while both joysticks have a positive charge. Hence, if at the beginning of minute some joystick is charged by 1 percent, it has to be connected to a charger, otherwise the game stops. If some joystick completely discharges (its charge turns to 0), the game also stops.\\n\\nDetermine the maximum number of minutes that game can last. It is prohibited to pause the game, i. e. at each moment both joysticks should be enabled. It is allowed for joystick to be charged by more than 100 percent.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line of the input contains two positive integers a_1 and a_2 (1 \u2264 a_1, a_2 \u2264 100), the initial charge level of first and second joystick respectively.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nOutput the only integer, the maximum number of minutes that the game can last.

Each minute, one joystick discharges by 2% if not charged, and the other charges by 1%. The game ends when either joystick reaches 0%.\\n- Identifying constraints: The core constraint is that the game stops when either joystick's charge becomes zero or less. Also, a joystick with 1% charge *must* be charged in that minute.\\n- Formulating a strategy: The optimal strategy seems to be charging the joystick with lower charge in each step to maximize the number of turns. If one joystick has a significantly higher charge, it might be beneficial to drain the higher one quickly to balance out.\\n- Handling edge cases: Consider edge cases such as when both joysticks start with 1% charge (the game ends immediately) and when one joystick has a very high charge compared to the other.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What conditions determine the end of the game, and how can you mathematically represent these conditions in the code?\",\n    \"What is the optimal strategy to maximize the game duration, and how does the decision of which joystick to charge affect the outcome?\",\n    \"What edge cases need to be considered, and how do these edge cases impact the solution's correctness?\",\n    \"How would you handle the situation where one joystick has a much higher charge than the other to ensure optimal game duration?\",\n    \"If both joysticks have only 1% charge, what should be the output, and why?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The game ends when either joystick's charge drops to 0 or less. This can be represented as a while loop condition: while a1 > 0 and a2 > 0.\",\n    \"The optimal strategy generally involves charging the joystick with the lower charge to prevent it from reaching 0 quickly. However, there might be scenarios where draining the higher charge initially yields a better result in the long run.\",\n    \"Edge cases include both joysticks starting with low charge (e.g., 1% each), one joystick having significantly higher charge than the other, or one joystick starting with 0% charge. These need to be handled appropriately to avoid incorrect results or infinite loops.\",\n    \"In cases where one joystick has a much higher charge than the other, consider discharging the higher one for a few turns to bring their charges closer. This might prevent the lower charge from reaching 0 too quickly and potentially extend the game duration.\",\n    \"If both joysticks have 1% charge, the game ends immediately because in the next turn at least one joystick charge will drop to 0 or less. Therefore, the output should be 0.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
