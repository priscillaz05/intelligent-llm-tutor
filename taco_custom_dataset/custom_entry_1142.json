There are N enemy buildings placed in a row and numbered from left to right strating from 0. Each building i (except the first and the last) has exactly two adjacent buildings with indices i-1 and i+1. The first and the last buildings have just a single adjacent building.\\n\\nSome of the buildings contain bombs. When bomb explodes in some building it destroys it and all adjacent to it buildings.\\n\\nYou are given the string S of length N, where Si is 1 if the i-th building contains bomb, 0 otherwise. Find for the Little Elephant the number of buildings that will not be destroyed after all bombs explode. Please note that all bombs explode simultaneously.\\n\\n-----Input-----\\nThe first line contains single integer T - the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains the single integer N - the number of buildings.

When a bomb explodes, it destroys the building containing it and its adjacent buildings. The goal is to find how many buildings remain after all bombs explode simultaneously.\\n- Identifying Edge Cases and Constraints: Note that the first and last buildings have only one adjacent building. The size of the input N can range from 1 to 1000. All bombs explode simultaneously.\\n- Selecting Algorithmic Strategy: Iterate through the buildings, checking for bombs ('1's). If a building has a bomb, mark the building itself and adjacent buildings as destroyed. After marking, count the remaining buildings that are not destroyed ('0's surrounded by '0's, including prepended and appended '0').\\n- Implementation Details: Since all bombs explode simultaneously, create a new array or string representing the state of each building after the explosions. Account for edge cases at the boundaries of the building sequence.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean that all bombs explode simultaneously, and how does this affect your approach?\",\n    \"How would you handle the edge cases of the first and last buildings in the row?\",\n    \"If a building with a bomb destroys itself and adjacent buildings, what conditions must be met for a building to remain undestroyed?\",\n    \"Given the simultaneous explosions, how should the initial string be processed or transformed to reflect the final state of the buildings?\",\n    \"What is the purpose of adding '0' to the beginning and end of the input string, and how does it simplify the logic?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Since bombs explode simultaneously, the destruction caused by one bomb doesn't affect the destruction caused by another. This requires calculating the total destruction before determining the remaining buildings.\",\n    \"The first and last buildings only have one neighbor, so you only need to check the effect of a bomb on that single neighbor.\",\n    \"For a building to remain undestroyed, it must not contain a bomb itself and none of its adjacent buildings can contain bombs. So, '0' must be surrounded by '0's.\",\n    \"The initial string can be iterated to mark buildings that are destroyed, creating a new array to represent buildings after all explosions. The buildings containing '1' and their adjacents becomes '1'.\",\n    \"Adding '0' to the beginning and end of the input string handles the edge cases of the first and last building more elegantly, as it ensures that even edge buildings have two neighbors, making the if-condition of 3 consecutive '0's work correctly for every building.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
