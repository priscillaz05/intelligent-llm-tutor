Also, since the answer could be a large number, performing modulo operations at each step is essential.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: The strategy involves first identifying prime numbers within the range 1 to n. Then, identifying the number of prime indices. Then counting total number of primes, calculating factorials of primes and non-primes and multiplying both.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Optimization in finding primes (Sieve of Eratosthenes), modulo operator application, and calculation of factorial.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the definition of a prime number and how does it apply to finding prime numbers within a range?\",\n    \"What is a prime index in the context of this problem, and how does it affect the permutation?\",\n    \"Given the constraints of n <= 100, what is an efficient algorithm to find prime numbers within this range?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the number of possible permutations with prime numbers at prime indices and other numbers at the remaining indices?\",\n    \"Given that the output should be modulo 10^9 + 7, when should you apply the modulo operation to prevent integer overflow during the factorial calculations?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
