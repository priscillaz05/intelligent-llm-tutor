Each cell (i, j) contains the value i * j.\\n- Identifying Constraints: The table size n can be up to 10^5, and the target number x can be up to 10^9. This suggests that a brute-force approach of checking every cell might be too slow.\\n- Optimization Strategy: Instead of iterating through the entire table, we can iterate through potential row numbers (i) and check if x is divisible by i. If it is, then x/i is a potential column number (j). We then need to check if both i and j are within the bounds of the table (1 <= i, j <= n).\\n- Edge Case Consideration: Consider the case when x is not found in the table at all. The count should be 0 in that case.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the constraints on n and x, and how might these constraints affect our choice of algorithm?\",\n    \"Instead of checking every cell, can we iterate over something smaller to find the solution faster?\",\n    \"Given a row number i, how can we determine if there's a column number j such that i * j = x?\",\n    \"After finding a potential pair (i, j) such that i * j = x, what conditions must i and j satisfy to be valid?\",\n    \"What happens if x is a prime number greater than n? How does this impact the approach?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"n can be up to 10^5, and x can be up to 10^9. These constraints suggest we should avoid brute-force approaches that would take O(n^2) time. Instead, we need an algorithm with lower complexity.\",\n    \"Yes, we can iterate through possible row numbers (i) from 1 to n and check if x is divisible by i.\",\n    \"If x is divisible by i (i.e., x % i == 0), then a potential column number j would be x / i.\",\n    \"Both i and j must be integers and must be within the table bounds, i.e., 1 <= i <= n and 1 <= j <= n.\",\n    \"If x is a prime number greater than n, it won't be found in the table because its only factors are 1 and itself, and 'itself' is too big to be a row or column index. If x is a prime number and it is less than or equal to n, and 1 <= x <= n, then the answer will be 2 if x is prime and x <=n, because 1 * x = x, x * 1 = x. Otherwise if there is no possible factor the answer will be 0.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
