The corners of the chocolate are put on (0,0), (w,0), (w,h) and (0,h). The chocolate has lines for cutting. They cut the chocolate only along some of these lines.\\n\\nThe lines are expressed as follows. There are  m  points on the line connected between (0,0) and (0,h), and between (w,0) and (w,h). Each i-th point, ordered by y value (i = 0 then y =0), is connected as cutting line. These lines do not share any point where 0 < x < w . They can share points where x = 0 or x = w . However, (0, li ) = (0,lj ) and (w,ri ) = (w,rj ) implies  i  =  j  . The following figure shows the example of the chocolate.\\n\\n<image>\\n\\nThere are  n  special almonds, so delicious but high in calories on the chocolate. Almonds are circle but their radius is too small. You can ignore radius of almonds. The position of almond is expressed as (x,y) coordinate.\\n\\nTwo turtles are so selfish. Both of them have requirement for cutting.\\n\\nShi-ta's requirement is that the piece for her is continuous. It is possible for her that she cannot get any chocolate. Assume that the minimum index of the piece is  i  and the maximum is  k . She must have all pieces between  i  and  k . For example, chocolate piece 1,2,3 is continuous but 1,3 or 0,2,4 is not continuous.\\n\\nBe-ko requires that the area of her chocolate is at least  S . She is worry about her weight. So she wants the number of almond on her chocolate is as few as possible.\\n\\nThey doesn't want to make remainder of the chocolate because the chocolate is expensive.\\n\\nYour task is to compute the minumum number of Beko's almonds if both of their requirment are satisfied.\\n\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\nInput consists of multiple test cases.\\nEach dataset is given in the following format.\\n\\n\\nn m w h S\\nl0 r0\\n...\\nlm-1 rm-1\\nx0 y0\\n...\\nxn-1 yn-1\\n\\n\\nThe last line contains five 0s. n is the number of almonds. m is the number of lines. w is the width of the chocolate. h is the height of the chocolate. S is the area that Be-ko wants to eat. Input is integer except xi yi.\\n\\nInput satisfies following constraints.\\n1 \u2264 n \u2264 30000\\n1 \u2264 m \u2264 30000\\n1 \u2264 w \u2264 200\\n1 \u2264 h \u2264 1000000\\n0 \u2264 S \u2264 w*h\\n\\nIf i < j  then  li \u2264 lj and  ri \u2264 rj and then  i -th lines and  j -th lines share at most 1 point. It is assured that lm-1 and rm-1 are h. xi yi is floating point number with ten digits. It is assured that they are inside of the chocolate. It is assured that the distance between points and any lines is at least 0.00001.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nYou should output the minumum number of almonds for Be-ko.\\n\\nExample\\n\\nInput\\n\\n2 3 10 10 50\\n3 3\\n6 6\\n10 10\\n4.0000000000 4.0000000000\\n7.0000000000 7.0000000000\\n2 3 10 10 70\\n3 3\\n6 6\\n10 10\\n4.0000000000 4.0000000000\\n7.0000000000 7.0000000000\\n2 3 10 10 30\\n3 3\\n6 6\\n10 10\\n4.0000000000 4.0000000000\\n7.0000000000 7.0000000000\\n2 3 10 10 40\\n3 3\\n6 6\\n10 10\\n4.0000000000 4.0000000000\\n7.0000000000 7.0000000000\\n2 3 10 10 100\\n3 3\\n6 6\\n10 10\\n4.0000000000 4.0000000000\\n7.0000000000 7.0000000000\\n0 0 0 0 0\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n2\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"from bisect import bisect_left\\nwhile True:\\n\\t(n, m, w, h, S) = map(int, input().split())\\n\\tif n == 0:\\n\\t\\tbreak\\n\\t(m, wh2) = (m + 1, 2 * (w * h))\\n\\tS = wh2 - 2 * S\\n\\t(tbl, s) = ([[0, 0, 0, 0]], [0])\\n\\tfor i in range(1, m):\\n\\t\\t(l, r) = map(int, input().split())\\n\\t\\ttbl.append([l, r, 0, r - l])\\n\\t\\ts.append((l + r) * w)\\n\\tp = []\\n\\tfor i in range(n):\\n\\t\\t(x, y) = map(float, input().split())\\n\\t\\tp.append((x, y))\\n\\tp.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))\\n\\tj = 1\\n\\tfor i in range(n):\\n\\t\\t(x, y) = p[i]\\n\\t\\twhile True:\\n\\t\\t\\ty1 = tbl[j - 1][3] * x / w + tbl[j - 1][0]\\n\\t\\t\\ty2 = tbl[j][3] * x / w + tbl[j][0]\\n\\t\\t\\tif y1 < y:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif y < y2:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tj += 1\\n\\t\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tj -= 1\\n\\t\\ttbl[j][2] += 1\\n\\tfor i in range(1, m):\\n\\t\\ttbl[i][2] += tbl[i - 1][2]\\n\\tif S == 0:\\n\\t\\tprint(n)\\n\\t\\tcontinue\\n\\telif S == wh2:\\n\\t\\tprint(0)\\n\\t\\tcontinue\\n\\tj = bisect_left(s, S, 0, m)\\n\\tif s[j] != S:\\n\\t\\tj -= 1\\n\\t(ans, i) = (tbl[j][2], 1)\\n\\twhile j + 1 < m:\\n\\t\\tj += 1\\n\\t\\twhile s[j] - s[i] > S:\\n\\t\\t\\ti += 1\\n\\t\\tans = max(ans, tbl[j][2] - tbl[i][2])\\n\\tprint(n - ans)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: Recognize that this problem involves dividing a rectangular chocolate with cutting lines and almonds, subject to two constraints: Shi-ta gets a continuous piece, and Be-ko gets a piece with area at least S and the minimum number of almonds.\\n- Data Structures and Input Parsing: Implement logic to efficiently read the input data, including the number of almonds (n), lines (m), width (w), height (h), required area (S), cutting lines (l, r), and almond coordinates (x, y).\\n- Determining Almond Locations: Write code to determine the region/piece that each almond lies in based on its coordinates and the cutting lines. This will involve comparing the y-coordinate of each almond against the cutting lines defined by (l, r) for each piece.\\n- Calculating Piece Areas: Develop a method to calculate the area of each piece. The cutting lines divide the rectangle into trapezoids or other shapes, so you will need to use appropriate geometric formulas for area calculation. Consider pre-calculating the area of each piece to optimize computations.\\n- Satisfying Shi-ta's Requirement: The critical constraint is that Shi-ta's piece must be continuous. This means considering all possible continuous sub-ranges of pieces (i to k). For each possible sub-range, determine the total area and the number of almonds.\\n- Satisfying Be-ko's Requirement and Minimizing Almonds: For each possible range of Shi-ta's chocolate (i to k), calculate the area of the remaining pieces of chocolate. If the area is at least S, count the number of almonds in those remaining pieces. Find the minimum number of almonds across all acceptable piece combinations for Be-ko.\\n- Edge Cases and Optimizations: Address edge cases such as S = 0 or S = w*h. Optimize the solution to avoid unnecessary calculations, possibly through pre-calculation or memoization techniques.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you efficiently determine which region each almond belongs to based on its coordinates and the provided cutting lines?\",\n    \"What data structure can you use to keep track of number of almonds in each section?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the area of chocolate given to Beko if Shi-ta takes section [i,k]?\",\n    \"What are some of the edge cases that need to be considered to handle different input scenarios correctly?\",\n    \"Can dynamic programming or memoization be applied to optimize the calculation of areas and almond counts to reduce time complexity?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"You can iterate through the cutting lines and, for each almond, check between which two lines its y-coordinate falls. Because the lines are sorted by y, the correct region can be found in O(m) time per almond in the worst case, or O(n*m) for all almonds. Binary search may be used since the lines are sorted by y coordinates, resulting in O(n log m) complexity.\",\n    \"A list/array where element at index i indicates number of almonds at index i.\",\n    \"Calculate area of the entire rectangle and subtract the area of sections from i to k.\",\n    \"Consider cases like S=0 (Be-ko needs no chocolate), S = w*h (Be-ko needs the entire chocolate), n = 0 (no almonds), empty cutting lines, or cases where no combination of cuts satisfies both Shi-ta and Be-ko's requirements.\",\n    \"Yes, memoization can be applied by storing pre-calculated areas and almond counts for all possible sub-ranges. Dynamic programming is not directly applicable because the problem does not have optimal sub-structure property where we are looking to maximize or minimize an objective function based on smaller overlapping subproblems, rather, checking combinations that fit the given constraint.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
