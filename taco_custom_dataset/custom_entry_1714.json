After another second, S = 010. Here, the first and the last bit were changed to 0 because earlier they were 1.

Every '1' flips to '0', and adjacent '0's flip to '1'. The task is to find the final state of the string after K seconds.\\n- Identifying the Key Logic: A bit's final state depends on how many times it's been flipped. A '1' bit will be flipped to '0' directly. A '0' bit flips to '1' if it has a neighboring '1'. The effect propagates.\\n- Choosing an Appropriate Strategy: For each index, find out how many seconds it takes for the effect of the nearest 1s to the left and the right to reach it. After K seconds, you can determine the final state of each bit based on parity.\\n- Implementing the Solution: The algorithm should simulate the process and optimize for large K. This can be done by keeping track of how many steps it takes for the '1's effect to reach a given zero. Using this, we can determine the final state by checking if the index has been affected an odd or even number of times.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does the initial state of the string affect the final result after K seconds?\",\n    \"How do you handle large values of K efficiently without simulating each second?\",\n    \"What special cases or constraints might significantly affect the algorithm's implementation or complexity?\",\n    \"How can you determine the distance to the nearest 1s from any index in the string efficiently?\",\n    \"How does the parity (odd/even) of the number of times an index has been affected relate to the final state of that index?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The initial state determines where the flips originate. The positions of '1' bits dictate how '0's get flipped over time, ultimately affecting the final configuration.\",\n    \"Instead of simulating each second, precompute the distances to the nearest '1' bits. Then, for each index, use modulo operations to determine the bit's state after K seconds based on these distances.\",\n    \"If the string contains only '0's or only '1's, the result is trivial. The constraints on N and K also affect the choice of data structures and algorithms (e.g., using dynamic arrays for very large strings).\",\n    \"Iterate through the string from left to right and right to left, keeping track of the nearest '1' seen so far. The minimum of the distances to the nearest '1' on the left and right gives the distance from that index.\",\n    \"If the number of times an index has been affected is odd, the bit is flipped relative to its initial state. If it's even, the bit remains in its initial state. You can use `K % 2` to determine whether to flip the original value based on how many '1's have influenced the index.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
