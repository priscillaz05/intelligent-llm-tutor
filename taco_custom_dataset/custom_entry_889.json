If there are multiple digits with the same highest frequency, return the largest of them. If no prime numbers exist within the range, return -1.\\n- Identify Core Tasks: 1) Generate prime numbers within the range [L, R]. 2) Extract individual digits from these prime numbers. 3) Count the frequency of each digit. 4) Determine the highest occurring digit and handle ties.\\n- Optimizing for Constraints: Consider the constraint 1 <= L <= R <= 1000. Since R is at most 1000, we can precompute prime numbers up to 1000 to optimize the prime checking process.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: If no prime numbers are found in the range, return -1. Consider the case where all digits have the same frequency, return the largest digit.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you efficiently determine if a number is prime within the specified range?\",\n    \"What data structure would you use to store the frequency of each digit, and why?\",\n    \"How will you handle the case where multiple digits have the same highest frequency?\",\n    \"What steps will be taken if no prime number is found between L and R?\",\n    \"How can you improve the time complexity, given the constraint 1 <= L <= R <= 1000?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"You can use a function to check primality by iterating from 2 up to the square root of the number. For a range like this, Sieve of Eratosthenes could also be used to precompute all primes up to R and then check if numbers in the range L to R are prime.\",\n    \"A dictionary or an array of size 10 can be used. The index (or key) represents the digit (0-9), and the value represents the frequency. This provides O(1) access for incrementing and retrieving counts.\",\n    \"When multiple digits have the same highest frequency, compare the digits themselves and return the larger digit. Maintain the largest seen digit with highest frequency while counting.\",\n    \"If no prime number is found between L and R, the function should return -1 as specified in the problem description.\",\n    \"Precomputing prime numbers up to 1000 using the Sieve of Eratosthenes would be an efficient way to improve the primality check. Then, simply iterate through the given range and count the digits using a hashmap.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
