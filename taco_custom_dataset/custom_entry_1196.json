Specifically, you need to rotate the string to the left by one or more positions.\\n- Algorithmic Approach: Iterate through all possible rotations of the input string and check if each rotated string is a palindrome.\\n- Optimizing Palindrome Check: Develop an efficient palindrome check to avoid unnecessary computations.\\n- Edge Cases: Consider cases such as an empty string, single-character strings, and strings that are already palindromes.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What constitutes a palindrome, and why is understanding this important for the problem?\",\n    \"How would you approach generating all possible left rotations of a string?\",\n    \"Given a potentially very long input string, how can you efficiently check if a given rotation is a palindrome?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases to consider, and how do they affect your approach?\",\n    \"Could you explain the time complexity of the solution in relation to the length of the string?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.
