Check the middle element; if it's smaller than its predecessor, it's the minimum; otherwise, narrow the search to either the left or right half based on whether the array is sorted around the middle element.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Address scenarios with no rotation (array is already sorted) and small arrays (one or two elements).\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does the rotation of the sorted array impact your ability to find the minimum element using traditional methods?\",\n    \"If the array is not rotated at all, how would you identify and handle this case efficiently?\",\n    \"How can binary search be adapted to work on a rotated sorted array to find the minimum element in O(log N) time complexity?\",\n    \"What conditions should be checked to determine whether the minimum element is to the left or right of the middle element during the binary search?\",\n    \"Are there any specific edge cases or array properties that could simplify or complicate the search for the minimum element, and how should you account for them?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The rotation disrupts the original sorted order, making a simple linear scan potentially O(n). This necessitates the use of an algorithm like binary search to maintain O(log N) efficiency.\",\n    \"If the array is not rotated, the first element will be the minimum. Check if arr[0] < arr[n-1]; if true, return arr[0].\",\n    \"Binary search can be adapted by comparing the middle element with its neighbors and the start/end elements to determine whether the minimum lies in the left or right half.\",\n    \"Compare the middle element with its neighbors. If arr[mid] < arr[mid - 1], arr[mid] is the minimum. If arr[mid] > arr[right], the minimum is on the right. Otherwise, the minimum is on the left.\",\n    \"If the array has duplicate elements, it may complicate determining which half to search.
