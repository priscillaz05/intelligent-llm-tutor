There are L-1 additional points on each of the sides dividing the sides into equal parts of unit lengths. Points on the sides of the triangle are called major points. Joining these points with lines parallel to the sides of \u0394ABC will produce some more equilateral triangles. The intersection points of these parallel lines are called minor points. \\n\\nLook at the picture below. It contains \\n\\n- Major points: A, B, C, P1, P2, Q1, Q3, R1, R4, S1, S2, S3 (note that we consider A, B, C as major points as well)\\n- Minor points: Q2, R2, R3\\n- Equilateral triangles \u0394P1Q1Q2, \u0394Q2S1S3, etc\\n\\nWe consider an equilateral triangle to be valid if\\n\\n- Each of its vertices is either a major or a minor point, and\\n- The distance from its base (the base of a triangle is the side parallel to BC) to BC is less than the distance from the other vertex of the triangle (i.e. opposite vertex that doesn't lie on the base of triangle) to BC.\\n\\nIn the figure above, \u0394Q2P1P2 is not a valid triangle but \u0394Q2R2R3 is a valid triangle.\\n\\nYou will be given L, the length of the original triangle \u0394ABC.

A triangle is valid if its vertices are major or minor points and the distance from its base to the base of the large triangle is less than the distance from its apex to the base of the large triangle.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints: Note that L and K are integers, and the valid triangles must have a side length exactly equal to K.\\n- Devising a Strategy: We can observe that the valid triangles are \\\"pointing up\\\" towards vertex A. We need to calculate how many such triangles of size K can fit inside the larger triangle of size L. The number of such triangles is dependent on how far from vertex A these triangles start, which determines how many valid positions there are for the base of the smaller triangle. The key insight is that if k > n, there will be 0 triangles, and if k <= n, then starting positions is n-k+1. Given start points, the number of triangles are computed by a summation series from 1 to n-k+1.\\n- Implementing the Formula: The formula for the number of triangles can be reduced to the sum of integers from 1 to (L - K + 1), which is (L - K + 1) * (L - K + 2) / 2.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: If K > L, there are no valid triangles, so the count is 0.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the conditions for a triangle to be considered 'valid' in this problem?\",\n    \"If the side length of the smaller triangle (K) is greater than the side length of the larger triangle (L), what is the number of valid triangles?\",\n    \"How do you determine the number of possible positions for the smaller triangles within the larger triangle?\",\n    \"Given the number of possible start points 'c', how do you calculate the total number of valid equilateral triangles with a side length of K?\",\n    \"What is the mathematical formula you can use to quickly compute the sum of integers from 1 to c = L - K + 1?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A triangle is considered valid if its vertices are either major or minor points, and the distance from its base (parallel to BC) to BC is less than the distance from the opposite vertex to BC.\",\n    \"If K > L, there are no valid triangles, so the count is 0.\",\n    \"The number of possible positions depends on the difference between L and K.
