He replied, cakes.\\nNow, chef cook $N$ number of cake and number of layers for every cake is different. After cakes are baked, Chef arranged them in a particular order and then generates a number by putting number of layers of cakes as digit in sequence (e.g., if chef arranges cakes with layers in sequence $2$, $3$ and $5$ then generated number is $235$).\\nChef has to make his son powerful in mathematics, so he called his son and ask him to arrange the cakes in all the possible ways and every time when different sequence is generated he has to note down the number. At the end he has to find sum of all the generated numbers. So, help him to complete this task.\\n\\n-----Input:-----\\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases.

This helps to simplify the summation process.\\n- Choose Correct Algorithmic Approach: Determine a mathematical approach instead of brute-force permutation generation. This involves calculating the sum of the digits, the frequency of each digit in each place value and using factorials to compute repetitions.\\n- Implementation Details: Account for all permutations, ensure handling repetitions, and correctly apply the place values (powers of 10) for the digits.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you determine the number of times each digit appears in each position (ones, tens, hundreds, etc.)?\",\n    \"What formula can you use to calculate the total sum efficiently without generating all permutations?\",\n    \"How would you handle the case where there are duplicate cake layers, and what adjustments need to be made to the general formula?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the contribution of each digit to the final sum based on its place value?\",\n    \"What are the potential edge cases for small input sizes, such as N=1 or N=2, and how should the formula be adjusted to handle these cases correctly?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Each digit appears in each position (ones, tens, hundreds, etc.) (n-1)! times, where n is the number of digits (cakes). This is because if we fix a digit in one position, the remaining n-1 digits can be arranged in (n-1)! ways.\",\n    \"The total sum can be calculated by multiplying the sum of the digits by (n-1)!, then multiplying that result by the sum of the place values (10^0 + 10^1 + ... + 10^(n-1)).\",\n    \"If there are duplicate cake layers, we must account for the number of duplicate permutations. The number of repetitions for each layer can be determined by number of occurences factorial. So the multiplier becomes `factorial(n-1) / factorial(num_of_repetitions)` for each layer.\",\n    \"The contribution of each digit is calculated by multiplying the digit's value by its frequency (number of permutations where it appears in each place) and then multiplying that result by the place value (10^i).\",\n    \"For N=1, the sum is simply the digit itself.
