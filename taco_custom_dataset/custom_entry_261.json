In these next few challenges, we're covering a divide-and-conquer algorithm called Quicksort (also known as Partition Sort).  This challenge is a modified version of the algorithm that only addresses partitioning.  It is implemented as follows: \\n\\nStep 1: Divide \\n\\nChoose some pivot element, $unrecognized$, and partition your unsorted array, $unrecognized$, into three smaller arrays: $unrecognized$, $unrecognized$, and $unrecognized$, where each element in $unrecognized$, each element in $unrecognized$, and each element in $unrecognized$. \\n\\nExample \\n\\n$unrecognized$   \\n\\nIn this challenge, the pivot will always be at $unrecognized$, so the pivot is $unrecognized$.\\n\\n$unrecognized$ is divided into $unrecognized$, $unrecognized$, and $unrecognized$. \\n\\nPutting them all together, you get $unrecognized$. There is a flexible checker that allows the elements of $unrecognized$ and $unrecognized$ to be in any order.  For example, $unrecognized$ is valid as well.    \\n\\nGiven $unrecognized$ and $unrecognized$, partition $unrecognized$ into $unrecognized$, $unrecognized$, and $unrecognized$ using the Divide instructions above. Return a 1-dimensional array containing each element in $unrecognized$ first, followed by each element in $unrecognized$, followed by each element in $unrecognized$.   \\n\\nFunction Description  \\n\\nComplete the quickSort function in the editor below.     \\n\\nquickSort has the following parameter(s):  \\n\\nint arr[n]: $unrecognized$ is the pivot element    \\n\\nReturns   \\n\\nint[n]: an array of integers as described above   \\n\\nInput Format\\n\\nThe first line contains $unrecognized$, the size of $unrecognized$. \\n\\nThe second line contains $unrecognized$ space-separated integers $unrecognized$ (the unsorted array). The first integer, $unrecognized$, is the pivot element, $unrecognized$.\\n\\nConstraints\\n\\n$unrecognized$   \\n$unrecognized$ where $unrecognized$   \\nAll elements are distinct.\\n\\nSample Input\\nSTDIN       Function\\n-----\\n5           arr[] size n =5\\n4 5 3 7 2   arr =[4, 5, 3, 7, 2]\\n\\nSample Output\\n3 2 4 5 7\\n\\nExplanation\\n\\n$unrecognized$ \\nPivot: $unrecognized$. \\n\\n$unrecognized$; $unrecognized$; $unrecognized$\\n\\n$unrecognized$, so it is added to $unrecognized$. \\n\\n$unrecognized$; $unrecognized$; $unrecognized$\\n\\n$unrecognized$, so it is added to $unrecognized$. \\n\\n$unrecognized$; $unrecognized$; $unrecognized$\\n\\n$unrecognized$, so it is added to $unrecognized$. \\n\\n$unrecognized$; $unrecognized$; $unrecognized$\\n\\n$unrecognized$, so it is added to $unrecognized$. \\n\\n$unrecognized$; $unrecognized$; $unrecognized$\\n\\nReturn the array $unrecognized$.\\n\\nThe order of the elements to the left and right of $unrecognized$ does not need to match this answer.

The pivot is the first element of the array.  The goal is to create three subarrays: elements less than the pivot, elements equal to the pivot, and elements greater than the pivot. The final output is a concatenation of these three subarrays.\\n- Algorithm Selection: A simple linear scan of the input array will suffice. Compare each element to the pivot and place it in the appropriate subarray (less, equal, or more).\\n- Implementation Details: The code must handle input correctly, parse the array, and construct the three subarrays.  The final step is to print the elements of the subarrays in the correct order with spaces in between.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How should the input be parsed to extract the array and the pivot?\",\n    \"What data structures are appropriate for storing the subarrays?\",\n    \"How should the final output array be constructed from the subarrays?\",\n    \"Does the solution need to handle edge cases, such as an empty array?\",\n    \"Is it important to consider the order of elements within the less than and greater than subarrays?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The input should be parsed by first reading the array size, and then reading the array elements, splitting them by spaces. The pivot element is the first element in the array.\",\n    \"Lists are appropriate for storing the subarrays since their size is not known beforehand.\",\n    \"The final output array is implicitly constructed by printing the elements of the less, equal, and more arrays in that order. Elements in the same sublist are space-separated.\",\n    \"The problem statement guarantees that the array is non-empty, so edge case handling for empty arrays is not necessary.\",\n    \"No. The problem description says that the flexible checker allows for the elements of less and more than to be in any order\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
