A solved state is defined as each face having all squares of the same color.\\n- Representing the Cube State: The cube's state is represented by a sequence of 24 integers, each corresponding to the color of a square.  Need to map these indices to the faces they belong to.\\n- Identifying Possible Rotations: There are 6 faces that can be rotated, and each can be rotated clockwise or counter-clockwise. This gives us 12 possible rotations.\\n- Checking for Solved State after Each Rotation: For each possible rotation, apply the rotation to the cube state, and then check if all 6 faces are solved. If any of the rotations lead to a solved state, the answer is \\\"YES\\\". Otherwise, the answer is \\\"NO\\\".\\n- Mapping Cube Indices: A crucial step is to know how the 24 indices are related to the cube's faces and how each rotation will affect the indices. This mapping determines how to update the array after each rotation.\\n- Optimization Considerations:  Because we only need to find *one* possible rotation that solves the cube, we can return \"YES\" immediately if a solved state is found.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How are the 24 integers representing the cube state mapped to the 6 faces of the cube?\",\n    \"How does a 90-degree rotation of each of the 6 faces affect the arrangement of the 24 integers representing the colors?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently check if a face of the cube is solved (i.e., all squares on that face have the same color)?\",\n    \"What are the 12 possible rotations (6 faces x 2 directions), and how can we iterate through them?\",\n    \"How can we avoid redundant calculations by immediately returning 'YES' if a solved state is found after a rotation?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The problem statement includes an image to help understand the mapping.  Each group of 4 consecutive integers represents a face. Specifically, understand the index mapping for each face of the cube. The prompt doesn't explicitly provide the mapping, requiring it to be inferred from the image or general Rubik's Cube knowledge.\",\n    \"A 90-degree rotation of a face will cycle the colors of the squares on that face. You need to know which integers are affected by each rotation, and what the new order of those integers will be after the rotation. Each rotation involves shifting indices to new positions.\",\n    \"To check if a face is solved, simply compare the colors of the four squares on that face. If all four colors are the same, the face is solved. This can be implemented by checking if a[i] == a[i+1] == a[i+2] == a[i+3] for the start index i of each face.\",\n    \"The possible rotations are clockwise and counter-clockwise rotations for each of the 6 faces.  This means you have to test 12 different transformations of the original input configuration.\",\n    \"After applying each rotation, check if the cube is solved. If it is, immediately print 'YES' and exit the function. This avoids unnecessary calculations.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
