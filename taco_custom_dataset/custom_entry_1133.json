There are $N$ students attending the course, numbered $1$ through $N$.\\n\\nBefore each lesson, Chef has to take attendance, i.e. call out the names of students one by one and mark which students are present. Each student has a first name and a last name. In order to save time, Chef wants to call out only the first names of students. However, whenever there are multiple students with the same first name, Chef has to call out the full names (both first and last names) of all these students. For each student that does not share the first name with any other student, Chef may still call out only this student's first name.\\n\\nHelp Chef decide, for each student, whether he will call out this student's full name or only the first name.\\n\\n------  Input ------\\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.\\n$N$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of the following $N$ lines contains two space-separated strings denoting the first and last name of student $i$.\\n\\n------  Output ------\\nFor each test case, print $N$ lines. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines should describe how Chef calls out the $i$-th student's name \u2015 it should contain either the first name or the first and last name separated by a space.\\n\\n------  Constraints  ------\\n$1 \u2264 T \u2264 100$\\n$2 \u2264 N \u2264 100$\\nall first and last names contain only lowercase English letters\\nthe lengths of all first and last names are between $1$ and $10$ inclusive\\n\\n------  Subtasks ------\\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\\n\\n----- Sample Input 1 ------ \\n1\\n\\n4\\n\\nhasan jaddouh\\n\\nfarhod khakimiyon\\n\\nkerim kochekov\\n\\nhasan khateeb\\n----- Sample Output 1 ------ \\nhasan jaddouh\\n\\nfarhod\\n\\nkerim\\n\\nhasan khateeb\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"for k in range(int(input())):\\n\\tn = int(input())\\n\\tl = []\\n\\ts = []\\n\\tfor i in range(n):\\n\\t\\ta = input()\\n\\t\\tx = a.split(' ')\\n\\t\\tl.append(x[0])\\n\\t\\ts.append(x[1])\\n\\tfor i in range(len(l)):\\n\\t\\tif l.count(l[i]) >= 2:\\n\\t\\t\\tprint(l[i], s[i])\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tprint(l[i])\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The task is to determine whether to print only the first name or the full name of each student based on whether there are duplicate first names in the student list.\\n- Data Structures: Use lists to store the first names and last names separately for easy access and comparison.\\n- Algorithm: For each student, count the occurrences of their first name in the list of first names.
