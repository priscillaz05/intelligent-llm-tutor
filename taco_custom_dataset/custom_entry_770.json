The state which secrets Gerald is selling, has no paper money, only coins. But there are coins of all positive integer denominations that are powers of three: 1 mark, 3 marks, 9 marks, 27 marks and so on. There are no coins of other denominations. Of course, Gerald likes it when he gets money without the change. And all buyers respect him and try to give the desired sum without change, if possible. But this does not always happen.\\n\\nOne day an unlucky buyer came. He did not have the desired sum without change. Then he took out all his coins and tried to give Gerald a larger than necessary sum with as few coins as possible. What is the maximum number of coins he could get?\\n\\nThe formal explanation of the previous paragraph: we consider all the possible combinations of coins for which the buyer can not give Gerald the sum of n marks without change. For each such combination calculate the minimum number of coins that can bring the buyer at least n marks. Among all combinations choose the maximum of the minimum number of coins. This is the number we want.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe single line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^17).\\n\\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64 bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nIn a single line print an integer: the maximum number of coins the unlucky buyer could have paid with.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n1\\n\\nOutput\\n1\\n\\nInput\\n4\\n\\nOutput\\n2\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first test case, if a buyer has exactly one coin of at least 3 marks, then, to give Gerald one mark, he will have to give this coin. In this sample, the customer can not have a coin of one mark, as in this case, he will be able to give the money to Gerald without any change.\\n\\nIn the second test case, if the buyer had exactly three coins of 3 marks, then, to give Gerald 4 marks, he will have to give two of these coins. The buyer cannot give three coins as he wants to minimize the number of coins that he gives.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"n = int(input())\\nwhile not n % 3:\\n\\tn //= 3\\nprint(n // 3 + 1)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understand the problem: The problem asks for the maximum number of coins a buyer could use to pay at least n marks, given that the buyer cannot pay exactly n marks. The coin denominations are powers of 3.\\n- Consider edge cases: If n is divisible by 3, the buyer cannot have any 1-mark coins or 3-mark coins or ... until some 3^k mark coins. Therefore divide n by 3 until it isn't divisible by 3.\\n- Deduce the formula: After dividing n as described above, we have two cases to consider: n=1 and n>1. If n = 1, the buyer must give 3, with only one coin. If n = 2, the buyer can give 3, again using one coin. If n = 4, the buyer must give two 3-mark coins.\\n- Find optimal strategy: The buyer wants to minimize the number of coins used to exceed n. The key idea is to eliminate factors of 3 from n by dividing it until it's no longer divisible by 3. Then, we compute n//3 + 1.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the possible coin denominations and how does this affect the buyer's payment strategy?\",\n    \"Why is it important to handle the case when n is divisible by 3?\",\n    \"How can we determine the minimum number of coins needed to pay at least n marks?\",\n    \"Can you explain the logic behind the formula `n // 3 + 1`?\",\n    \"What are the key constraints in this problem and how do they impact the solution approach?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The coin denominations are powers of 3 (1, 3, 9, 27, ...). This means the buyer's payments will always be sums of powers of 3. The buyer will try to exceed the amount n with as few coins as possible.\",\n    \"If n is divisible by 3, it suggests that a buyer *could* have made exact change if they possessed an appropriate assortment of coins. To maximize the coins used while not being able to provide exact change, you must remove these easily-usable combinations.\",\n    \"To determine the minimum number of coins needed to pay at least n marks, the buyer needs to use coins of denominations as large as possible while still overpaying. Consider that the buyer cannot provide exact change.\",\n    \"The formula `n // 3 + 1` gives the number of coins needed to be used for a minimized overpayment. After removing all factors of 3, `n` represents the smallest value of such an impossible sum. If `n` is 1 or 2, using 1 coin of 3 results in '1'. If n is between 4 and 5, using 2 coins of 3 is the answer.\",\n    \"The key constraints are that the buyer cannot provide the exact sum of n marks and must minimize the number of coins used to pay at least n marks. Also, coin denominations are limited to powers of 3. This forces to overpay with as few as possible such coins.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
