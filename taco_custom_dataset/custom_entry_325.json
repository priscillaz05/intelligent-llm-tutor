Limak is a police officer. He lives in a city a. His job is to catch criminals. It's hard because he doesn't know in which cities criminals are. Though, he knows that there is at most one criminal in each city. Limak is going to use a BCD (Bear Criminal Detector). The BCD will tell Limak how many criminals there are for every distance from a city a. After that, Limak can catch a criminal in each city for which he is sure that there must be a criminal. You know in which cities criminals are.

The BCD provides the number of criminals at each distance from Limak's city. The goal is to count how many criminals Limak can confidently catch.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints: The cities are arranged in a row, and the distance is the absolute difference between city indices. There can be at most one criminal in each city. Limak only catches criminals in cities where the BCD information guarantees a criminal's presence.\\n- Devising a Strategy: Iterate through possible distances from Limak's city. Check if there are two cities at equal distance from the city Limak lives in. If there is only one city at a certain distance and the BCD says there is a criminal there, Limak can catch the criminal. Keep track of the caught criminals and return the total count. Pay attention to edge cases where the city Limak lives in has a criminal or not.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Consider the case where Limak's city itself contains a criminal. Also, handle cases where there might be more cities to the left or right of Limak. If Limak is close to the edge, the pairs of cities might not be valid since city indexes range from 1 to n.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you determine if Limak is certain that a criminal exists in a particular city based on the BCD information?\",\n    \"How do you handle the case where Limak's own city might contain a criminal?\",\n    \"How can you determine the cities at a given distance from Limak's city?\",\n    \"What data structure is suitable to keep track of the number of criminals that Limak can catch?\",\n    \"What edge cases do we need to handle considering that the city indexes are within 1 to n?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Limak is certain if there is only one city at a specific distance, and the BCD detects a criminal at that distance.\",\n    \"Include the criminal in Limak's city in the initial count before checking for criminals in other cities.\",\n    \"For a given distance d, the cities are a + d and a - d, where a is Limak's city.
