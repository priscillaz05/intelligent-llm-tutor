The $i$-th letter of $a$ is $a_i$, the $i$-th letter of $b$ is $b_i$, the $i$-th letter of $c$ is $c_i$.\\n\\nFor every $i$ ($1 \\leq i \\leq n$) you must swap (i.e. exchange) $c_i$ with either $a_i$ or $b_i$. So in total you'll perform exactly $n$ swap operations, each of them either $c_i \\\\leftrightarrow a_i$ or $c_i \\\\leftrightarrow b_i$ ($i$ iterates over all integers between $1$ and $n$, inclusive).\\n\\nFor example, if $a$ is \\\"code\\\", $b$ is \\\"true\\\", and $c$ is \\\"help\\\", you can make $c$ equal to \\\"crue\\\" taking the $1$-st and the $4$-th letters from $a$ and the others from $b$. In this way $a$ becomes \\\"hodp\\\" and $b$ becomes \\\"tele\\\".\\n\\nIs it possible that after these swaps the string $a$ becomes exactly the same as the string $b$?\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe input consists of multiple test cases.

For each test case:\\n\\nIf it is possible to make string $a$ equal to string $b$ print \\\"YES\\\" (without quotes), otherwise print \\\"NO\\\" (without quotes).\\n\\nYou can print either lowercase or uppercase letters in the answers.\\n\\n\\n-----Example-----\\nInput\\n4\\naaa\\nbbb\\nccc\\nabc\\nbca\\nbca\\naabb\\nbbaa\\nbaba\\nimi\\nmii\\niim\\n\\nOutput\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first test case, it is impossible to do the swaps so that string $a$ becomes exactly the same as string $b$.\\n\\nIn the second test case, you should swap $c_i$ with $a_i$ for all possible $i$. After the swaps $a$ becomes \\\"bca\\\", $b$ becomes \\\"bca\\\" and $c$ becomes \\\"abc\\\". Here the strings $a$ and $b$ are equal.\\n\\nIn the third test case, you should swap $c_1$ with $a_1$, $c_2$ with $b_2$, $c_3$ with $b_3$ and $c_4$ with $a_4$. Then string $a$ becomes \\\"baba\\\", string $b$ becomes \\\"baba\\\" and string $c$ becomes \\\"abab\\\".

This is because c[i] must be swapped with either a[i] or b[i], and if it's different from both, then a and b will necessarily be different at that position after the swap.\\n- Developing a Solution Strategy: Iterate through each index i of the strings. Check if c[i] is equal to either a[i] or b[i]. If for all indices this condition holds, then it's possible to make a = b.

However, If they were of different lengths, the algorithm would need to be adapted to consider the minimum length of the three strings, as the comparison would only be valid up to that length.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
