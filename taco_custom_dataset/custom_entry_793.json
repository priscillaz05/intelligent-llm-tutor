Each card has a rank (2-9, T, J, Q, K, A) and a suit (S, H, D, C).\\n- Data Representation: Decide how to represent the cards and their ranks numerically to facilitate comparisons and calculations. The suits could be represented simply, or their presence checked via sets.\\n- Identifying Poker Hand Rules: Understand and encode the specific rules for each poker hand category, including royal flush, straight flush, four of a kind, full house, flush, straight, three of a kind, two pairs, pair, and high card.\\n- Algorithm Design: Create a sequence of checks, from highest to lowest hand type, to determine the best classification for a given hand. Optimization is key, as a 'royal flush' check negates lower checks. Each function should set a 'confirm' flag if there's a match.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Consider cases where an Ace can act as both the highest and lowest card in a straight (A, 2, 3, 4, 5).  The input cards are guaranteed to not repeat.\\n- Implementation Details: Implement functions for each hand type to check for the required conditions. The 'straight' checks require sorting to ensure cards are in sequence.  The 'full_house' check looks for distinct counts. Check 'flush' before 'straight' to disambiguate 'straight_flush'. The code needs a top-down approach for effective hand classification.\\n- Testing: Create various test cases, including edge cases, to validate that the program correctly identifies each type of hand.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you numerically represent the card ranks to facilitate comparisons for straights, and how would you handle the Ace?\",\n    \"What's the most efficient way to check for a 'flush' or 'straight flush' given the suit information?\",\n    \"How can you structure the code to prioritize the hand checks from highest to lowest, stopping as soon as a match is found?\",\n    \"In the case of checking for 'straight', how would you account for the possibility of an Ace being considered both high and low?\",\n    \"How would you ensure that your solution handles edge cases, such as an Ace in the hand making both straight and royal flush possibilities?\",\n    \"How do you determine if a hand is a 'full house' efficiently given five cards?\",\n    \"What steps are needed to differentiate a 'straight' from a 'straight flush'?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The card ranks can be mapped to integers (e.g., A=14, K=13, Q=12, J=11, T=10, 9=9, ..., 2=2). To handle the Ace in a low straight, create a secondary sorted list where A=1, allowing it to be sorted as the lowest card.\",\n    \"For checking 'flush', you can use a set of the suits. If the set has length 1, all cards are of the same suit.  To distinguish 'straight flush', check if the hand is also a 'straight' after confirming that it is a 'flush'.\",\n    \"Structure the code as a sequence of if/elif statements, starting with the highest-ranking hand (royal flush) and moving down. Use a flag variable ('confirm' in the reference code) to stop checking further hands once a match is found.\",\n    \"When checking for a 'straight', sort the card ranks. Then, iterate through the sorted list to check if the difference between consecutive cards is 1. Also consider the special case A, 2, 3, 4, 5 by creating a separate sorted array with Ace as the lowest rank.\",\n    \"Ensure that you check for a 'royal flush' before checking for a 'straight' or 'flush'. If the hand is not a royal flush, then proceed to check other possibilities by considering the alternate rank array for the Ace as low card in the straight\",\n    \"A 'full house' has 3 cards of the same rank and 2 cards of another rank. You can check for a count of 3 for one rank and a count of 2 for another. This can be done with a collections.Counter object, or simply by iterating and counting.\",\n    \"First, check for a 'flush' (all cards of the same suit). If it's a flush, then check if it's also a 'straight' (cards in sequence). If it's both, then it's a 'straight flush'. If it's only a flush, then it's just a 'flush'. Check the straight after the flush\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
