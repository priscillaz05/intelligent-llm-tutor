Let's punish those filthy capitalists, as we all know that being rich has to be somehow a fault and a shame!\\n\\nIf you happen to have few people as the richest, just take from the ones with the lowest index (the closest to the left, in few words) in the array first, on a 1:1 based heroic proletarian redistribution, until everyone is satisfied.\\n\\nTo clarify this rule, assuming a population `[2,3,5,45,45]` and `5` as `minimum`, the expected result should be `[5,5,5,42,43]`.\\n\\nIf you want to see it in steps, consider removing `minimum` from every member of the population, then iteratively (or recursively) adding 1 to the poorest while removing 1 from the richest. Pick the element most at left if more elements exist with the same level of minimal poverty, as they are certainly even more aligned with the party will than other poor people; similarly, it is ok to take from the richest one on the left first, so they can learn their lesson and be more kind, possibly giving more *gifts* to the inspectors of the State!\\n\\nIn steps:\\n```\\n[ 2, 3, 5,45,45] becomes\\n[-3,-2, 0,40,40] that then becomes\\n[-2,-2, 0,39,40] that then becomes\\n[-1,-2, 0,39,39] that then becomes\\n[-1,-1, 0,38,39] that then becomes\\n[ 0,-1, 0,38,38] that then becomes\\n[ 0, 0, 0,37,38] that then finally becomes (adding the minimum again, as no value is no longer under the poverty threshold\\n[ 5, 5, 5,42,43]\\n```\\n\\nIf giving `minimum` is unfeasable with the current resources (as it often comes to be the case in socialist communities...), for example if the above starting population had set a goal of giving anyone at least `30`, just return an empty array `[]`.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def socialist_distribution(population, minimum):\\n\\tif minimum > sum(population) // len(population):\\n\\t\\treturn []\\n\\twhile min(population) < minimum:\\n\\t\\tpopulation[population.index(min(population))] += 1\\n\\t\\tpopulation[population.index(max(population))] -= 1\\n\\treturn population\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: Recognize the need to redistribute wealth from the richest to the poorest until everyone has at least the `minimum`. Grasp the rule that if multiple people are equally poor or rich, the leftmost one is prioritized.\\n- Checking Feasibility: Determine if the redistribution is possible by checking if the `minimum` is greater than the average wealth. If not feasible, return an empty array.\\n- Implementing the Redistribution: Iteratively redistribute wealth by incrementing the poorest person's wealth by 1 and decrementing the richest person's wealth by 1, repeating until everyone reaches the `minimum`.\\n- Edge Case Handling: Consider edge cases such as an empty population array (which isn't explicitly mentioned but should be handled gracefully) or when all members already meet the `minimum` requirement.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you determine if it's possible to redistribute wealth such that everyone meets the minimum requirement?\",\n    \"How should the redistribution occur when multiple members of the population are equally rich or equally poor?\",\n    \"What should be returned if it is impossible to redistribute the wealth?\",\n    \"What edge cases are important to consider such as empty or null inputs?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Check if the `minimum` is greater than the average wealth. If it is, redistribution is impossible.\",\n    \"If multiple members are equally poor or rich, prioritize the leftmost one.\",\n    \"Return an empty array [] if redistribution is impossible.\",\n    \"Handle the case where the input list is empty or None. A robust solution might return the empty list, or raise an exception.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
