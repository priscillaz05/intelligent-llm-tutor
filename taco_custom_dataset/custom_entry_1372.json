When the workers laid the parquet, it became clear that the tiles pattern looks not like Peter likes, and workers will have to re-lay it.\\n\\nThe workers decided that removing entire parquet and then laying it again is very difficult task, so they decided to make such an operation every hour: remove two tiles, which form a 2 \u00d7 2 square, rotate them 90 degrees and put them back on the same place.\\n\\n<image>\\n\\nThey have no idea how to obtain the desired configuration using these operations, and whether it is possible at all.\\n\\nHelp Peter to make a plan for the workers or tell that it is impossible.

The parquet is made of 1x2 tiles represented by 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D'.\\n- Representing the Board: The initial and target states are represented as n x m grids of characters. The core operation is to rotate a 2x2 square.\\n- Algorithmic Approach: A key insight is to process the current and desired configurations independently to obtain intermediate, normalized states. Any differences between the normalized configurations would indicate impossibility. The given solution normalizes the rows from top to bottom. An alternative would be to solve from the bottom to top, and reverse the steps to solve the original configuration.\\n- Identifying the `fix` function: This function appears to be the core of the solution. It takes a position (x, y) and a list of moves as input.  It aims to \\\"fix\\\" the tile starting at that position to its desired orientation by performing rotations.\\n- Two-Phase Approach: The given solution applies the `solve_board` function twice. Once to the initial configuration and once to the target configuration. The number of moves necessary to convert to the normalized grid are recorded. Then, the target configuration's operations are reversed to go from the normalized configuration back to the desired configuration. The steps from both phases are combined and printed.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can the initial and final configurations be compared efficiently to determine if a solution is even possible?\",\n    \"What is the purpose of the 'fix' function, and how does it ensure that the tile arrangement at a given position is corrected?\",\n    \"Why are the transformations applied to both the initial and final states? What is the role of the intermediate normalized state?\",\n    \"How are the operations to transform the desired configuration back into its specified form calculated and applied?\",\n    \"What edge cases or error conditions would render a valid solution impossible to find, and how would you detect such situations?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The initial and final configurations can be transformed into a normal form. If these normal forms are not equal, no solution exists.\",\n    \"The 'fix' function corrects the orientation of the tile at position (x, y) by rotating 2x2 blocks. It uses recursion when the tile below the initial tile is 'U' and the tile to the right is 'L'. The function then makes a rotation to fix the tile's orientation, and then performs a rotation at the starting position.\",\n    \"The transformations are applied to both the initial and final states to obtain intermediate normalized states. The initial state is transformed into this normal state.  To obtain the final state, you must reverse the operations to go from the normal form back to the final configuration.\",\n    \"To transform the desired configuration back into its specified form, reverse the operations performed during the transformation from the desired configuration to the normal configuration.  The operations are recorded and then applied in reverse order.\",\n    \"If after normalizing the initial and desired states, they are not identical, a valid solution is impossible to find. Furthermore, constraints like the dimension having to be even and other constraints must be satisfied.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
