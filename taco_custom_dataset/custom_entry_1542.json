Let's imagine a segment of a street as long as L meters along which a parking lot is located. Drivers should park their cars strictly parallel to the pavement on the right side of the street (remember that in the country the authors of the tasks come from the driving is right side!). Every driver when parking wants to leave for themselves some extra space to move their car freely, that's why a driver is looking for a place where the distance between his car and the one behind his will be no less than b meters and the distance between his car and the one in front of his will be no less than f meters (if there's no car behind then the car can be parked at the parking lot segment edge; the same is true for the case when there're no cars parked in front of the car). Let's introduce an axis of coordinates along the pavement. Let the parking lot begin at point 0 and end at point L. The drivers drive in the direction of the coordinates' increasing and look for the earliest place (with the smallest possible coordinate) where they can park the car. In case there's no such place, the driver drives on searching for his perfect peaceful haven. Sometimes some cars leave the street and free some space for parking. Considering that there never are two moving cars on a street at a time write a program that can use the data on the drivers, entering the street hoping to park there and the drivers leaving it, to model the process and determine a parking lot space for each car.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line contains three integers L, b \u0438 f (10 \u2264 L \u2264 100000, 1 \u2264 b, f \u2264 100). The second line contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100) that indicates the number of requests the program has got. Every request is described on a single line and is given by two numbers. The first number represents the request type. If the request type is equal to 1, then in that case the second number indicates the length of a car (in meters) that enters the street looking for a place to park. And if the request type is equal to 2, then the second number identifies the number of such a request (starting with 1) that the car whose arrival to the parking lot was described by a request with this number, leaves the parking lot. It is guaranteed that that car was parked at the moment the request of the 2 type was made. The lengths of cars are integers from 1 to 1000.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nFor every request of the 1 type print number -1 on the single line if the corresponding car couldn't find place to park along the street. Otherwise, print a single number equal to the distance between the back of the car in its parked position and the beginning of the parking lot zone.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nInput\\n\\n30 1 2\\n6\\n1 5\\n1 4\\n1 5\\n2 2\\n1 5\\n1 4\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n0\\n6\\n11\\n17\\n23\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n30 1 1\\n6\\n1 5\\n1 4\\n1 5\\n2 2\\n1 5\\n1 4\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n0\\n6\\n11\\n17\\n6\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n10 1 1\\n1\\n1 12\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n-1\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"(l, b, f) = map(int, input().split())\\np = [[-b, -b, -192], [l + f, l + f, -38]]\\nn = int(input())\\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\\n\\t(a, h) = map(int, input().split())\\n\\tif a == 1:\\n\\t\\tk = False\\n\\t\\tfor w in range(len(p) - 1):\\n\\t\\t\\tif p[w + 1][0] - p[w][1] >= b + f + h:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tp.insert(w + 1, [p[w][1] + b, p[w][1] + b + h, i])\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tk = True\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprint(p[w][1] + b)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\t\\tif not k:\\n\\t\\t\\tprint(-1)\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tfor t in range(len(p)):\\n\\t\\t\\tif p[t][2] == h:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tp.pop(t)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbreak\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem describes a parking lot of length L, with constraints on the minimum distance b behind and f in front of each car.  The program needs to process requests to park (type 1) and unpark (type 2) cars, outputting the parking location or -1 if no spot is found.\\n- Data Structures: Use a list to represent the occupied parking spaces. Each entry in the list could store the starting and ending positions, as well as the request number that parked there.\\n- Algorithm for parking (type 1): Iterate through the occupied parking spaces to find a suitable gap. The gap's length must be at least b + f + car_length. Insert a new parking space record into the list if a spot is available and print the start location of the parked car. Otherwise, print -1.\\n- Algorithm for unparking (type 2): Remove the parking space record corresponding to the released car's request number from the list.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Consider boundary conditions at the start and end of the parking lot. Implement dummy parking spots at the start (-b) and end (L+f) to simplify boundary checks.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How should the parking lot be represented in memory to efficiently find available spaces?\",\n    \"What data structure is most suitable for storing the occupied parking spaces, and what information should each entry contain?\",\n    \"When a car requests to park, how do you efficiently search for a suitable space that meets the minimum distance requirements behind and in front?\",\n    \"How do you handle the boundary conditions at the start and end of the parking lot segment?\",\n    \"How can the code be structured to handle both parking and unparking requests efficiently?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The parking lot can be represented as a sorted list of occupied spaces, where each entry stores the start and end positions of a parked car.\",\n    \"A list of lists can be used. Each inner list would contain the start position, end position, and the request number of the car parked in that spot.\",\n    \"Iterate through the sorted list of occupied spaces and check the gap between adjacent cars. The gap must be at least b + f + car_length.\",\n    \"Treat the start and end of the parking lot as permanently occupied spaces. Create dummy spaces with position -b and L+f to avoid edge case checks in the main loop.\",\n    \"The code should have separate functions for parking (searching and inserting), unparking (removing based on request number), and a main loop to process each request and call the appropriate function.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
