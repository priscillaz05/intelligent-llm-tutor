We need to output the result modulo 10^7 + 7.\\n- Choosing the Right Approach: Since we need to calculate the number of ways and the value of `n` can be up to 10^6, dynamic programming is a suitable approach. We can build an array `dp` where `dp[i]` stores the number of ways to represent the number `i` as a sum of 1, 3, and 4.\\n- Defining the Base Cases: `dp[0]` can be considered as 1 (representing an empty sum). `dp[1]` will be 1 (only 1), `dp[2]` will be 1 (1+1), `dp[3]` will be 2 (1+1+1, 3), and `dp[4]` will be 4 (1+1+1+1, 1+3, 3+1, 4).\\n- Defining the Recursive Relation: To calculate `dp[i]`, we can add 1, 3, or 4 to smaller numbers. So, `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-3] + dp[i-4]`. This holds true for `i > 3`.\\n- Handling Modulo: Since the result can be large, we need to take the modulo (10^7 + 7) after each addition to prevent overflow.\\n- Implementing the Solution: Create a `dp` array, initialize the base cases, iterate from 5 to `n`, calculate `dp[i]` using the recursive relation and modulo operation, and finally, print `dp[n]`.\\n- Optimization: Use an array with size up to 1000007 to store all possible values and use memoization to avoid unnecessary recomputation. Pre-compute the values to answer queries in constant time.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the base cases for the dynamic programming solution (dp[0], dp[1], dp[2], dp[3], dp[4])?\",\n    \"How can you define the recursive relation for calculating dp[i] in terms of dp[i-1], dp[i-3], and dp[i-4]?\",\n    \"Why is it important to take the modulo (10^7 + 7) during each addition step?\",\n    \"What is the time complexity of the proposed dynamic programming solution?\",\n    \"How do you handle the input and output formats as specified in the problem description?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"dp[0] = 1, dp[1] = 1, dp[2] = 1, dp[3] = 2, dp[4] = 4\",\n    \"dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-3] + dp[i-4]\",\n    \"To prevent integer overflow since the number of ways can be very large.
