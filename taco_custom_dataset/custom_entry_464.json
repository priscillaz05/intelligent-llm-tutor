Another approach could involve iteratively dividing N by 8 until N becomes 1 or less than 1. If N becomes 1, it is a power of 8; otherwise, it is not.\\n- Consider Edge Cases: Consider edge cases such as N = 0 and N = 1.\\n- Optimization: Given the constraint of 1 <= N <= 10^18, directly comparing against powers of 8 may be inefficient. A better method could involve using logarithms, but we need to be careful with floating-point precision. Using bit manipulation to check the power of two and then checking that power is divisible by three is efficient.\\n- Implement Solution: Implement the selected algorithm efficiently and test thoroughly.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the key characteristics of a number that is a power of 8, and how can these characteristics be exploited to determine if a number is a power of 8?\",\n    \"How would you handle the constraint that N can be as large as 10^18, and what implications does this have for your choice of algorithm and data types?\",\n    \"Can you describe the possible edge cases and how they might affect your solution?

This means it is also a power of 2, specifically 2^(3k). This property can be used to determine if a number is a power of 8.\",\n    \"Since N can be as large as 10^18, using integer data types (long long in C++, long in Java, or int in Python) is essential to avoid overflow.

If N is 1, it can be considered 8^0, so it is a power of 8. The code should handle these cases correctly.\",\n    \"Because every power of eight is also power of 2.
