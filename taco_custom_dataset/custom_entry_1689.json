The goal is to find x_n and y_n for a given n and eight integer parameters, modulo 10^9.\\n- Identifying Core Concepts: The problem is efficiently solvable using matrix exponentiation due to the linear recurrence relations. Consider converting the recurrences into matrix form to calculate x_n and y_n for large n.\\n- Matrix Construction Strategy: Formulate a matrix that captures the recurrence relations for x_n and y_n, taking into account the constants a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h. This involves identifying how previous terms influence the current term.\\n- Handling Base Cases and Modulo: Properly handle the base case where n < 0 (x_n = y_n = 1) and apply the modulo operation (10^9) at each step to prevent overflow.\\n- Optimizing Matrix Exponentiation: Use an efficient matrix exponentiation algorithm (e.g., binary exponentiation) to compute the nth power of the transformation matrix, which dramatically reduces the computation time for large values of n.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you represent the given recurrences $x_n$ and $y_n$ in matrix form to efficiently compute them for large n?\",\n    \"How do you handle the $n*d^n$ and $n*h^n$ terms in the recurrences when converting them to matrix multiplication?\",\n    \"What is the dimension of the matrix needed to capture both $x_n$ and $y_n$ recurrences along with the linear terms, and how would you construct this matrix?\",\n    \"How does the base case (n < 0) affect the initialization of the state vector or initial matrix conditions?\",\n    \"How can you ensure that the modulo operation is applied correctly throughout the computation to avoid integer overflow issues?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The recurrences can be represented in matrix form by constructing a transformation matrix that updates a state vector containing the previous values of $x_n$ and $y_n$ needed to compute the next values.\",\n    \"To handle the $n*d^n$ and $n*h^n$ terms, you need to include additional rows and columns in the matrix to represent these terms as linear combinations. The matrix should be constructed such that these terms are updated correctly with each matrix multiplication step. Specifically add terms to the matrix that model n, d^n, h^n so that they transform appropriately.\",\n    \"The dimension of the matrix depends on the number of previous terms required and the additional linear terms. In this case, since $1 <= a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h < 10$, you might need to keep track of the last 8 values of each sequence plus the $n*d^n$ and $n*h^n$ terms. A 22x22 matrix can be made to model the recurrences, since we need the previous values $x_{n-a}, x_{n-f}, x_{n-g}, y_{n-b}, y_{n-c}, y_{n-e}$\",\n    \"For $n < 0$, both $x_n$ and $y_n$ are equal to 1. This base case is important for initializing the state vector correctly before applying the matrix exponentiation.\",\n    \"The modulo operation should be applied after each matrix multiplication and addition to prevent overflow. This ensures that the intermediate results remain within the bounds of the modulo value (10^9).\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
