"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"A faro shuffle of a deck of playing cards is a shuffle in which the deck is split exactly in half and then the cards in the two halves are perfectly interwoven, such that the original bottom card is still on the bottom and the original top card is still on top.\\n\\nFor example, faro shuffling the list\\n```python\\n['ace', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six']\\n```\\ngives\\n```python\\n['ace', 'four', 'two', 'five', 'three', 'six' ]\\n```\\n\\nIf 8 perfect faro shuffles are performed on a deck of 52 playing cards, the deck is restored to its original order.\\n\\nWrite a function that inputs an integer n and returns an integer representing the number of faro shuffles it takes to restore a deck of n cards to its original order.\\n\\nAssume n is an even number between 2 and 2000.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def faro_cycles(n):\\n\\t(x, cnt) = (2, 1)\\n\\twhile x != 1 and n > 3:\\n\\t\\tcnt += 1\\n\\t\\tx = x * 2 % (n - 1)\\n\\treturn cnt\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Faro Shuffle: Understand how a faro shuffle interleaves two halves of a deck, and that the top and bottom cards remain in place.\\n- Identifying the Core Task: Recognize that the problem requires finding the number of faro shuffles needed to restore the deck to its original order.\\n- Abstracting the Problem: Realize that each shuffle can be modeled as a permutation, and the question is to find the number of times you need to apply this permutation to get back to the identity permutation.\\n- Finding the Pattern: Consider how the positions of cards change with each shuffle and identify the mathematical pattern underlying the shuffles.\\n- Developing an Efficient Algorithm: Devise a fast method to calculate the number of shuffles without explicitly performing them.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Can you describe the faro shuffle process step by step to ensure you understand how the cards are rearranged?\",\n    \"What is the mathematical operation that simulates a card's movement during a faro shuffle?\",\n    \"How can we efficiently determine when the deck is restored to its original order without actually shuffling the cards?\",\n    \"What conditions might lead to edge cases, and how should these be handled?\",\n    \"Can you think of a different approach or optimization technique for a very large deck size?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The deck is split into two equal halves. The two halves are then interwoven perfectly, with the cards alternating from each half. The top and bottom cards remain in place.\",\n    \"A card initially at position 'i' goes to position '2i mod (n-1)', where 'n' is the number of cards in the deck, and the indices are 1-based instead of 0-based with card at top remaining in the same position. Also, top card remains at top.\",\n    \"We can track the position of a single card (e.g., the second card from the top). The deck is restored when that card returns to its original position.\",\n    \"An edge case would be a small deck size. The while loop must have a check to avoid infinite looping when n <= 3.\",\n    \"Instead of explicitly tracking the position of one card, we can look at cycle decomposition. This might reduce redundancy when the deck is huge.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
