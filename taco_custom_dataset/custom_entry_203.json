So, they started hiring new recruits in groups.\\n\\nMeanwhile, crimes keeps occurring within the city. One member of the police force can investigate only one crime during his/her lifetime.\\n\\nIf there is no police officer free (isn't busy with crime) during the occurrence of a crime, it will go untreated.\\n\\nGiven the chronological order of crime occurrences and recruit hirings, find the number of crimes which will go untreated.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line of input will contain an integer n\\u00a0(1 \\u2264 n \\u2264 10^5), the number of events. The next line will contain n space-separated integers.\\n\\nIf the integer is -1 then it means a crime has occurred. Otherwise, the integer will be positive, the number of officers recruited together at that time. No more than 10 officers will be recruited at a time.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nPrint a single integer, the number of crimes which will go untreated.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n3\\n-1 -1 1\\n\\nOutput\\n2\\n\\nInput\\n8\\n1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 1 1\\n\\nOutput\\n1\\n\\nInput\\n11\\n-1 -1 2 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1\\n\\nOutput\\n8\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nLets consider the second example:  Firstly one person is hired.  Then crime appears, the last hired person will investigate this crime.  One more person is hired.  One more crime appears, the last hired person will investigate this crime.  Crime appears. There is no free policeman at the time, so this crime will go untreated.  One more person is hired.  One more person is hired.  One more person is hired. \\n\\nThe answer is one, as one crime (on step 5) will go untreated.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import sys\\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\\ninstr = sys.stdin.readline().split()\\ncount = 0\\ns = 0\\nfor c in instr:\\n\\tif int(c) > 0:\\n\\t\\ts += int(c)\\n\\telif int(c) < 0 and s == 0:\\n\\t\\tcount += 1\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\ts += int(c)\\nprint(count)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem describes a scenario where police officers are hired and crimes occur. Each officer can solve only one crime. The goal is to count the number of crimes that go untreated due to the lack of available officers.\\n- Identifying Input Format: The input consists of the number of events (n) followed by a sequence of integers. Positive integers represent the number of officers hired, and -1 represents a crime occurrence.\\n- Devising a Strategy: Maintain a variable `s` to track the number of available officers. Iterate through the events. If an officer is hired, increase `s`. If a crime occurs, check if there are available officers. If `s > 0`, decrement `s` (an officer handles the crime). Otherwise, increment the count of untreated crimes.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Consider cases where the input is empty or there are no crimes. Ensure the logic correctly handles scenarios with multiple consecutive crimes and officer hirings.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does the problem define an 'untreated' crime, and what condition signifies that a crime goes untreated?\",\n    \"If multiple officers are hired at once, how does that affect the availability of officers for handling crimes?\",\n    \"If multiple crimes occur consecutively without any officers being hired in between, how should these crimes be handled in terms of whether they are treated or untreated?\",\n    \"What data structures or variables are needed to effectively keep track of the number of available officers and the number of untreated crimes?\",\n    \"How would you handle the input to ensure that each event (hiring or crime) is processed in the correct chronological order?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"An untreated crime is one that occurs when there are no police officers available (not busy with another crime) to investigate it. A crime goes untreated if, at the moment it occurs, the number of available officers is zero.\",\n    \"If multiple officers are hired simultaneously, it increases the number of available officers by the number of officers hired. Each officer can investigate one crime.\",\n    \"If multiple crimes occur consecutively without officers being hired, each crime is checked against the current number of available officers. Only crimes that occur when no officers are available are counted as untreated.\",\n    \"A variable `s` is needed to keep track of the current number of available officers, which is incremented when officers are hired and decremented when a crime is handled. Another variable `count` is needed to store the number of untreated crimes, incremented when a crime occurs with no available officers.\",\n    \"The input should be processed in a sequential manner, iterating through the given sequence of events in the order they are provided. Each integer encountered represents either a hiring event (positive number) or a crime occurrence (-1), which should be processed accordingly.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
