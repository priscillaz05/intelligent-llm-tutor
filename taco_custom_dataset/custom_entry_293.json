In other words, pair $(i,j)$ is beautiful if and only if $A[i]=B[j]$. A set containing beautiful pairs is called a beautiful set.\\n\\nA beautiful set is called pairwise disjoint if for every pair $\\\\left(l[i],r[i]\\\\right)$ belonging to the set there is no repetition of either $l\\\\left[i\\\\right]$ or $r[i]$ values. For instance, if $A=[10,11,12,5,14]$ and $B=[8,9,11,11,5]$ the beautiful set $[(1,2),(1,3),(3,4)]$ is not pairwise disjoint as there is a repetition of $\\\\mbox{I}$, that is $l[\\\\textbf{0}][\\\\textbf{0}]=l[1][\\\\textbf{0}]$. \\n\\nYour task is to change exactly $1$ element in $\\\\mbox{B}$ so that the size of the pairwise disjoint beautiful set is maximum.\\n\\nFunction Description  \\n\\nComplete the beautifulPairs function in the editor below.

A beautiful pair is formed when A[i] equals B[j]. Pairwise disjoint means no index from A or B is repeated in any pair in the selected set.\\n- Data Structures and Counts: Use dictionaries to count the occurrences of each number in both arrays A and B. This facilitates efficient matching of equal elements.\\n- Matching Elements: Iterate through the numbers in array A. For each number, check if it exists in array B. If it does, create as many pairs as possible. This is determined by the minimum count of that number in arrays A and B.\\n- Handling the Modification: After the initial matching, determine whether to increment or decrement the total count based on whether all elements could form pairs initially. If all elements could form pairs, then changing one element in array B will necessarily decrease the count by 1.\\n- Final Answer: Print total + 1 if initially not all pairs could be matched (you change B to create 1 additional match); otherwise, print total - 1 (you change B to ruin one existing match).\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you determine the maximum number of pairwise disjoint beautiful pairs without changing any element of array B?\",\n    \"If the number of maximum pairwise disjoint beautiful pairs is less than N, what should you do to one of the elements of B to maximize the pairwise disjoint beautiful pairs?\",\n    \"How do you decide if you need to add 1 or subtract 1 from the number of maximum pairwise disjoint beautiful pairs?\",\n    \"How should you efficiently keep track of which elements of array A and B can form pairs?\",\n    \"What edge cases should be considered in the scenario where all elements of A can initially form pairs with elements in B?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Determine the counts of each number in both A and B. For each number, find the minimum count between A and B. Summing up these minimum counts over all numbers gives the maximum number of disjoint beautiful pairs without changing B.\",\n    \"Change one of the elements in B to any value that doesn't already exist in A or B. By doing this, you could potentially form one additional beautiful pair, as long as changing that element doesn't decrease the total count by removing an already existing beautiful pair.\",\n    \"If the maximum number of disjoint pairs without changing B is already equal to N (the length of A), then changing an element in B will always decrease the total count by 1. If the number is less than N, then changing an element can increase the count by 1.\",\n    \"Use dictionaries (hashmaps) to store the counts of each number in A and B. This allows you to quickly determine how many times a certain number appears in each array and efficiently calculate the minimum count for forming pairs.\",\n    \"If all elements of A can form pairs with elements in B, meaning the initial maximum disjoint pairs is N, then changing any element in B will always reduce the number of disjoint pairs by 1. Thus, the answer will be N-1.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
