A palindromic substring reads the same forwards and backward. The substring with the smallest starting index should be returned in case of multiple substrings having the same maximal length.\\n- Choosing a Solution Strategy: Given the constraints and the expected time complexity O(n^2) and auxiliary space O(1), consider an approach that involves iterating through all possible substrings and checking if each is a palindrome. Start with longer substrings and work down to smaller ones. If a palindrome is found, return immediately, ensuring the earliest occurring maximal palindrome is returned.\\n- Implementing Palindrome Verification: Use string slicing to extract substrings. Comparing the substring with its reverse efficiently verifies whether it is a palindrome.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Consider edge cases like when the input string is already a palindrome or when the input string has length 1.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What defines a palindromic substring, and what characteristics should the algorithm prioritize when identifying the longest palindromic substring?\",\n    \"Given the time complexity constraint, what is the best approach to identify and verify palindromes in a given string?\",\n    \"What considerations are important when handling the scenario where multiple palindromic substrings have the same maximal length?\",\n    \"How would you approach verifying if a given substring is a palindrome, and what are potential performance optimizations for this task?\",\n    \"What are important edge cases to consider when determining the longest palindromic substring, and how should they affect the implementation?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A palindromic substring is a sequence of characters that reads the same forwards and backwards.
