The goal is to determine how many questions she can grade before fainting.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: The program needs to handle cases where 'xx' does not appear in the string. In such cases, AOR Ika grades all N questions.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Search for the first occurrence of 'xx' in the string. If found, the index of the first 'x' plus 1 gives the number of questions graded. If 'xx' is not found, then the number of graded questions is N.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Use try-except block to handle the case when 'xx' is not in S, which will result in ValueError.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What condition causes AOR Ika to stop grading?\",\n    \"How can we detect the first occurrence of two consecutive incorrect answers?\",\n    \"What should the code do if AOR Ika doesn't encounter two consecutive incorrect answers?\",\n    \"How can a try-except block be used here?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"AOR Ika stops grading when she finds two consecutive incorrect answers ('xx').\",\n    \"The first occurrence of 'xx' can be found using the string's 'index' method, searching for the substring 'xx'.\",\n    \"If AOR Ika does not encounter two consecutive incorrect answers, she grades all N questions.\",\n    \"The try block can contain the index method. If 'xx' is not found, index() raises a ValueError, which is caught by the except block. In the except block, we print N, as she grades all questions.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
