Each turn he can choose to do one of the two following actions:\\n\\nhe can either erase exactly one letter 'A' and exactly one letter 'B' from arbitrary places of the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent);\\n\\nor he can erase exactly one letter 'B' and exactly one letter 'C' from arbitrary places in the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent).\\n\\nTherefore, each turn the length of the string is decreased exactly by $2$. All turns are independent so for each turn, Casimir can choose any of two possible actions.\\n\\nFor example, with $s$ $=$ \\\"ABCABC\\\" he can obtain a string $s$ $=$ \\\"ACBC\\\" in one turn (by erasing the first occurrence of 'B' and the second occurrence of 'A'). There are also many other options for a turn aside from this particular example.\\n\\nFor a given string $s$ determine whether there is a sequence of actions leading to an empty string. In other words, Casimir's goal is to erase all letters from the string. Is there a way to do this?\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\\\le t \\\\le 1000$) \u2014 the number of test cases.\\n\\nEach test case is described by one string $s$, for which you need to determine if it can be fully erased by some sequence of turns.
