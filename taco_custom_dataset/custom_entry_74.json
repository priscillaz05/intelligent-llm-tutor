The function must also validate the distribution, checking if the probabilities sum to 1 and if the variable values are integers.\\n- Handling Errors: The function needs to identify and handle potential errors, such as an invalid probability distribution (probabilities not summing to 1) or non-integer variable values. Specific error messages should be returned based on the type of error or combination of errors.\\n- Calculation of Statistical Measures: Once the input is validated, the function should proceed to calculate the mean, variance, and standard deviation using the formulas provided.\\n- Implementation Details: Use appropriate loops or comprehensions to efficiently calculate the required statistical measures.
