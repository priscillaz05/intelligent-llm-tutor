Help him.\\nThere will be n tickets on the table. Each ticket has a number written on it. The i-th ticket can be numbered A_{i} with probability P_{i} percent and with probability 100-P_{i} percent it can be numbered B_{i}. It can not have any other number. A numbering of tickets on the table is correct if and only if all tickets have distinct ticket numbers.\\n\\nHelp Little Elephant find the probability that the numbering will be correct.\\n\\n------ Input ------ \\n\\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n - the number of tickets on the table. n lines will follow.

An important edge case to consider is when n exceeds 16, in which case the probability of having all distinct tickets is 0 since there can be no more than 16 distinct values.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Approach: Dynamic programming with bitmasking can efficiently solve this problem. A bitmask can represent which ticket numbers have already been used. The DP state will be (mask, probability), and we can iterate through each ticket and update the probability of assigning either A_i or B_i to the current mask.\\n- Implementing the Solution: Initialize the DP with an empty mask and probability 1. Iterate through the tickets. For each ticket, update the mask with A_i's probability and B_i's probability, ensuring that A_i and B_i are distinct and not already in the mask. The final answer is the sum of the probabilities of all masks where all tickets have been assigned unique numbers.\\n- Optimizing for Performance: Use appropriate data structures, such as dictionaries, to store the DP states. Take care to handle floating-point arithmetic accurately.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you represent which ticket numbers have already been used in an efficient way?\",\n    \"How do you update the probability if assigning a specific ticket number would cause a collision (i.e., the number is already present in the current mask)?\",\n    \"If n > 16, what is the probability of all tickets having distinct numbers, and why?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently iterate through all the possible combinations of ticket assignments while maintaining the probability?\",\n    \"What is the base case for the dynamic programming approach, and how do you initialize it?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A bitmask is a suitable representation. Each bit in the mask corresponds to a ticket number, and if the bit is set, it indicates that the number has already been used.\",\n    \"If the assigned ticket number is already present in the mask, this assignment is invalid, so the probability for that branch becomes 0, or we can simply not update the mask in that case.\",\n    \"If n > 16, the probability is 0. Since A_i and B_i can only be between 1 and 16, if we have more than 16 tickets, at least two tickets must have the same number.\",\n    \"Dynamic programming with bitmasking allows us to efficiently iterate through all combinations. The outer loop iterates through the tickets, and the inner loop iterates through the existing masks. We update the masks based on the probabilities of assigning either A_i or B_i to each ticket.\",\n    \"The base case is an empty mask (no tickets assigned) with a probability of 1. This signifies that before assigning any tickets, there is a 100% probability that no numbers are duplicated.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
