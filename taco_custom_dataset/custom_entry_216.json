Then, read N integers from the next N lines. For each of these N integers, subtract 1 and print the result on a new line.\\n- Data Structures: Use a list (or array) to store the N integers. Iterate through this list to perform the subtraction and printing.\\n- Input Handling: Handle the input correctly by first reading N and then reading the N integers.\\n- Output Formatting: Ensure the output prints each result on a new line.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How many lines of input will there be in total, and what does each represent?\",\n    \"What data structure is appropriate for storing the input integers, and why?\",\n    \"What should the program do with the first line of input?\",\n    \"How should the output be formatted?\",\n    \"How to convert input in string format to integer format\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"There will be N+1 lines.
