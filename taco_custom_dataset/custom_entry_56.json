The task is to find the number of elements in the union between these two arrays. \\nUnion of the two arrays can be defined as the set containing distinct elements from both the arrays. If there are repetitions, then only one occurrence of element should be printed in the union.\\nNote : Elements are not necessarily distinct.\\nExample 1:\\nInput:\\n5 3\\n1 2 3 4 5\\n1 2 3\\nOutput: \\n5\\nExplanation: \\n1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are the\\nelements which comes in the union set\\nof both arrays.

The set will only store unique elements.\",\n    \"Once you have a set of unique elements, you can use the `len()` function to return the number of elements in the set, giving you the count of unique elements.\",\n    \"Combining arrays using the + operator takes O(n+m) time, where n and m are the lengths of the arrays. Converting the combined array to a set also takes O(n+m) time in the worst case and uses O(n+m) space in the worst case where all elements are distinct. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n+m) and the space complexity is O(n+m).\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
