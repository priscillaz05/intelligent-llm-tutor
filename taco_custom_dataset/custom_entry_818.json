Also, recognize that the result should be modulo 1000000007.\\n- Identifying the Pattern: Determine that the number of ways to represent 'n' is the nth Fibonacci number. This can be derived by noticing that G(n) = G(n-1) + G(n-2), where G(1) = 1 and G(2) = 2. This is because any representation of 'n' can either end with a '1' or can be formed by adding 2 to each number in a representation of n-2. For example, G(4) can be represented as G(3) + G(2-1), where G(3)=2 and G(1) = 1 (i.e. 1+1+1, 3). We can derive 4 = 1 + 1+ 1+1, 1+3 from 1 + 1 + 1, 1, and 3+1 from G(2) : 1+1. \\n- Selecting an Algorithm: Choose an efficient algorithm to calculate the nth Fibonacci number, particularly since 'n' can be very large (up to 10^18). Matrix exponentiation is an appropriate approach for this.\\n- Implementing Matrix Exponentiation: Implement the matrix exponentiation algorithm to calculate the nth Fibonacci number modulo 1000000007. This involves defining the base matrix, a matrix multiplication function, a matrix squaring function, and a matrix exponentiation function.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the underlying mathematical pattern or relationship that connects the input 'n' to the desired output G(n)?\",\n    \"How can you calculate the nth Fibonacci number efficiently, especially given the large possible values of 'n' (up to 10^18)?\",\n    \"Why is matrix exponentiation suitable for this task, and how does it work to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently?\",\n    \"When implementing matrix exponentiation, what is the base matrix used, and how are the matrix multiplication and squaring operations defined?\",\n    \"How should you handle the modulo operation throughout the computation to prevent integer overflow and ensure the result stays within the specified range (modulo 1000000007)?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The underlying pattern is that G(n) is the nth Fibonacci number, with G(1) = 1 and G(2) = 2.\",\n    \"Matrix exponentiation is an efficient method to calculate the nth Fibonacci number, especially for large values of 'n'.\",\n    \"Matrix exponentiation works by representing the Fibonacci sequence using matrix multiplication, which can then be raised to the power of 'n' to find the nth Fibonacci number in logarithmic time.\",\n    \"The base matrix is [[1, 1], [1, 0]].
