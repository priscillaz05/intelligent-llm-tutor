This involves prime factorization and combinatorics of the powers of those primes.\\n- Identifying Key Insight: An even divisor must have at least one factor of 2. Thus, to count even divisors, count the total number of divisors, and subtract the number of odd divisors, or directly calculate based on the prime factorization.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Prime factorize N. Then, count all divisors. To find the number of odd divisors, remove all factors of 2 from N. Then count the divisors for remaining odd number. Then subtract the number of odd divisors from the total number of divisors to get the number of even divisors.\\n- Implementation Considerations: The range of N goes up to 10^9, so a prime factorization method that iterates until the square root of N is necessary.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What constitutes an 'even divisor,' and how does this affect the prime factorization approach?\",\n    \"Given a number N, what is the most efficient way to perform prime factorization considering N can be as large as 10^9?\",\n    \"How would you calculate the total number of divisors of a number if you already have the prime factorization?\",\n    \"How would you modify the prime factorization process to specifically count only the odd divisors of a number?\",\n    \"Once you know the total divisors and odd divisors, how can you quickly determine the number of even divisors?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"An even divisor must have at least one factor of 2. Therefore, during prime factorization, it's important to identify the exponent of 2 because this exponent directly impacts the count of even divisors.\",\n    \"An efficient way is to iterate from 2 up to the square root of N.
