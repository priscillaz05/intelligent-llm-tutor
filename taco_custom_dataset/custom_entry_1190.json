The king of the islands is a very generous person, he donates a certain amount of gold coins to travelers for visiting each island that they visited to.\\nNow, you are appointed as a traveler, who will travel to all these(or some) islands as many times as the Army wants, and you will collect gold coins from the king of the island.\\nIn each trip, you will be asked to give the total sum of gold coins you have collected.\\n\\n-----Input:-----\\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$. $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases is as follows.\\n- The next line of the input contains a single integer $N$. $N$ denotes the total number of Islands.\\n- The next line of the input contains $N$ space-separated integers $A1, A2, A3...An$ where $ith$ number denotes the maximum number of coins that the king of $ith$ island can donate.\\n- Next line contains a single integer $Q$. $Q$ denotes the total number of times traveler have to go for the trip.\\n- Next $Q$ lines contains, two space-separated integers $Q1,Q2$ denoting the start and end number of islands, i.e. traveler will start the trip from $Q1th$ island and will go till $Q2th$ island, in each trip.\\nNote: islands are numbered from $1$ to $N$.\\n\\n-----Output:-----\\n- For each trip print the total number of gold coins, traveler will collect(each on a new line).\\n\\n-----Constraints:-----\\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 100$\\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^4$\\n- $1 \\leq A1, A2, A3...An \\leq 10^5$\\n- $1 \\leq Q \\leq 10^3$\\n- $1 \\leq Q1,Q2 \\leq N$\\n\\n-----Sample Input:-----\\n1\\n4\\n10 2 5 50\\n2\\n1 3\\n2 4\\n\\n-----Sample Output:-----\\n17\\n57\\n\\n-----Explanation:-----\\n-\\nIn 1st Trip, traveler will go from 1st Island to 3rd Island, hence the total number of coins traveler can collect is 10+2+5 = 17\\n-\\nIn 2 d Trip, traveler will go from 2nd Island to 4th Island, hence the total number of coins traveler can collect is 2+5+50 = 57\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"for i in range(int(input())):\\n\\tN = int(input())\\n\\tl = list(map(int, input().split()))\\n\\tfor j in range(int(input())):\\n\\t\\t(q1, q2) = map(int, input().split())\\n\\t\\ttemp = l[q1 - 1:q2]\\n\\t\\tprint(sum(temp))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Problem Description Understanding: Understand the problem context, including the inputs (number of test cases, number of islands, coin values, number of trips, trip start and end points) and the desired output (total coins collected per trip).\\n- Input Parsing and Storage: Figure out how to parse the input, store the island coin values in a suitable data structure (e.g., a list or array), and manage multiple test cases and trips.\\n- Sum Calculation: Calculate the sum of coin values for each trip by iterating through the specified island range and adding their coin values.\\n- Boundary Condition Handling: Handle array indexing properly, considering that island numbers are from 1 to N, while list indices are from 0 to N-1.\\n- Output Formatting: Ensure the correct output format, printing the total coins for each trip on a new line.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How should the input be structured to handle multiple test cases?\",\n    \"What data structure is best to store the coin values for each island?\",\n    \"How do you correctly calculate the sum of coins for a given trip, considering the island indices start from 1?\",\n    \"What needs to be considered when slicing the array to get the coins for each trip?\",\n    \"How can you format the output to ensure each trip's coin total is printed on a new line?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The input starts with a number T indicating the number of test cases, and each test case will contain the details for N islands and Q trips.\",\n    \"A list (or array) is appropriate for storing the coin values, allowing direct access using indices.\",\n    \"Subtract 1 from the start and end island numbers to adjust for the 0-based indexing of the list.
