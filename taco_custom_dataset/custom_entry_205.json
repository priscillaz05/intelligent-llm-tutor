These doughnuts are called Doughnut 1, Doughnut 2, ..., Doughnut N. In order to make one Doughnut i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 N), she needs to consume m_i grams of Moto. She cannot make a non-integer number of doughnuts, such as 0.5 doughnuts.\\n\\nThe recipes of these doughnuts are developed by repeated modifications from the recipe of Doughnut 1. Specifically, the recipe of Doughnut i (2 \u2264 i \u2264 N) is a direct modification of the recipe of Doughnut p_i (1 \u2264 p_i < i).\\n\\nNow, she has X grams of Moto. She decides to make as many doughnuts as possible for a party tonight. However, since the tastes of the guests differ, she will obey the following condition:\\n\\n* Let c_i be the number of Doughnut i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 N) that she makes. For each integer i such that 2 \u2264 i \u2264 N, c_{p_i} \u2264 c_i \u2264 c_{p_i} + D must hold. Here, D is a predetermined value.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt most how many doughnuts can be made here?

This suggests a dynamic programming or greedy approach that considers the dependencies.\\n- Identifying Possible Approaches: We need to consider a combination of doughnuts to maximize their total count within the Moto limit. A dynamic programming approach could track the maximum number of doughnuts achievable with a given amount of Moto and the constraint `D`.\\n- Addressing Edge Cases: Consider scenarios where `D` is very large or small, and how it affects the feasibility of making certain doughnuts. Also, consider how to handle cases where X is much smaller than the amount of Moto needed for even a small number of doughnuts.\\n- Optimizing the Doughnut Counts: The constraints on `c_i` suggest that we can build up the counts from the root (doughnut 1) down to the leaves. We want to maximize the total doughnut count, so a greedy approach involving prioritizing doughnuts that give the highest count per Moto might be helpful.\\n- Algorithmic Design: It seems that we should try dynamic programming in conjunction with considering the hierarchical constraints. We might track the maximum number of doughnuts for each quantity of Moto and ensure that the conditions of the problem are met.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can we represent the dependencies between different doughnut types to efficiently calculate the maximum number of doughnuts?\",\n    \"What is the time and space complexity when choosing a certain type of algorithm, and how does it scale with N, X, and D?\",\n    \"What are some of the bottlenecks with DP and greedy algorithms?\",\n    \"How can we effectively use dynamic programming to handle the constraint that the number of doughnuts of one type depends on another?\",\n    \"What should we do when X is much smaller than the amount of Moto needed for just one doughnut?\",\n    \"Is it better to calculate each number independently or should we consider the amount of Moto we use each iteration?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"We can use an adjacency list or a similar data structure to represent the parent-child relationship between doughnut types. This would allow us to efficiently traverse the dependency graph during the calculations.\",\n    \"The DP solutions usually require O(NX) space and O(sum of C[i] * X) time complexity, which is bad.
