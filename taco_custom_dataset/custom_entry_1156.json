The description of the T test cases follow.\\n- Each test case consists of two lines\\n- The first line contains a single integer D, the number of digits in N.\\n- The second line consists of a string of length D, the number N (in decimal representation). It is guaranteed that the string does not contain leading zeroes and consists only of the characters 0, 1, \\\\dots 9.\\n\\n------ Output Format ------ \\n\\n- For each test case, print \\\\texttt{Yes} if it is possible to rearrange the digits of N so that it becomes a multiple 5. Otherwise, print \\\\texttt{No}.\\n\\nYou may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings \\\\texttt{YeS}, \\\\texttt{yEs}, \\\\texttt{yes} and \\\\texttt{YES} will all be treated as identical).\\n\\n------ Constraints ------ \\n\\n$1 \u2264 T \u2264 1000$\\n$1 \u2264 D \u2264 1000$\\n$1 \u2264 N < 10^{1000}$\\n- Sum of $D$ over all test cases $\u2264 1000$.\\n\\n----- Sample Input 1 ------ \\n3\\n3\\n115\\n3\\n103\\n3\\n119\\n----- Sample Output 1 ------ \\nYes\\nYes\\nNo\\n----- explanation 1 ------ \\nTest Case $1$: The given number is already divisible by $5$, therefore the answer is $\\\\texttt{Yes}$.\\n\\nTest Case 2: We can obtain $310 = 62 \\\\cdot 5$ by rearranging the digits of $103$, so the answer is $\\\\texttt{Yes}$.\\n\\nTest Case 3: The only numbers that can be obtained by rearranging the digits of $119$ are \\\\{119, 191, 911\\\\}.

Therefore, we only need to check if the digits of N contain either a 0 or a 5.\\n- Algorithm Selection: Iterate through the digits of N and check if any of them are 0 or 5. If either is found, then print 'Yes'. Otherwise, print 'No'.\\n- Implementation Details: Read the input according to the specified format. Iterate through the string representation of the number N to check if it contains '0' or '5'.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What condition must be met for a number to be divisible by 5?\",\n    \"Given that you only need to check for the presence of '0' or '5', how would you efficiently search for these digits in the input string?\",\n    \"What input format and constraints do you need to consider while reading input?\",\n    \"How would you handle multiple test cases?\",\n    \"What should the output be if no such rearrangement is possible?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A number must end with 0 or 5 to be divisible by 5.\",\n    \"I would iterate through the characters of the string representing the number and check if any of them is equal to '0' or '5'.
