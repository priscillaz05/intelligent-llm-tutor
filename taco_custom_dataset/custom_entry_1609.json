You could use a string containing all vowels and check if the character is in that string.\",\n    \"The boundary conditions are that the index must be non-negative and within the string's length (i.e., 0 <= index < string length).\",\n    \"Combine the boundary checks with the vowel check using a boolean 'and' operator. First, check if the index is within bounds (0 <= index < len(string)), and only then check if the character at that index is a vowel.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
