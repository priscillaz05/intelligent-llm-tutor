Two types of operations are supported: update and report.\\n- Decoding update operation: The update operation U r t a b adds a value calculated from a and b to all nodes in the subtree rooted at t, considering the tree is rooted at r. The added value is a^b + (a+1)^b + (b+1)^a.\\n- Decoding report operation: The report operation R r t m computes the sum of all nodes in the subtree rooted at t, given that the tree is rooted at r, and outputs the sum modulo m.\\n- Data structure choice: The problem involves a tree, but given the constraints and the provided code, a simple array can simulate the tree node values, and the subtree operations can be simplified by considering only the indices.\\n- Simplified subtree update: The problem uses indices as a proxy for subtrees and applies updates based on a simple condition (x > y).  This greatly simplifies subtree selection. It updates the tree node array.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you represent the tree structure and node values in your solution?\",\n    \"What is the formula for calculating the value to be added during an update operation?\",\n    \"How do you determine the nodes that belong to a subtree for the update operation?\",\n    \"What data type should be used to store the intermediate values to avoid overflow issues, considering a, b can be as large as 10^18?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the sum of nodes in a subtree for the report operation and apply the modulo operation?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A simple array of size N can be used, where each element arr[i] represents the value of the i-th node.\",\n    \"The value to be added is a^b + (a+1)^b + (b+1)^a.\",\n    \"Based on the problem description and provided code, the subtree selection criteria are simplified.

However, given the provided code that calculates this sum and then immediately adds it to the values in array, and that finally each value in the array will be summed up and modulo'd to a value m <= 101, integer is an appropriate type to avoid overcomplexifying the solution with BigIntegers.\",\n    \"For the report operation, sum the values of nodes in the relevant portion of array (determined again by checking whether int(x) > int(y), summing the first y or elements from x onwards).
