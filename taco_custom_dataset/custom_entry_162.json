Also, understand how prime factorization can help determine the divisors of L.\\n- Developing a Strategy: The problem can be solved by finding the prime factorization of L, and then using that to compute the number of divisor pairs (a, b) whose LCM is L.  If L = p1^e1 * p2^e2 * ... * pk^ek, then the number of pairs will involve the product of (2*e_i + 1) for each prime factor p_i and its exponent e_i, all divided by 2 and then potentially adding 1 if the product is odd.\\n- Considering Edge Cases: Handle the case when L = 1 separately, as its only pair is (1, 1).  Also, efficiently find prime factors for L, considering that L can be up to 10^12. A sieve is used to precompute primes up to a certain limit for efficient factorization.  The algorithm also handles the case when L is prime or has prime factors larger than the sieve range.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for the LCM(a, b) to equal L, and how does this constraint relate a and b to L?\",\n    \"Given that L can be as large as 10^12, how can you efficiently find its prime factorization without exceeding the time limit?\",\n    \"How can the prime factorization of L be used to calculate the number of pairs (a, b) whose LCM is equal to L?\",\n    \"What are some edge cases you should consider, such as when L = 1 or when L is a prime number?\",\n    \"How can you optimize the search for prime factors of L to handle large values and avoid unnecessary computations?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"LCM(a, b) = L means that L is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both a and b. Therefore, both a and b must be divisors of L, and no smaller number than L is divisible by both.\",\n    \"Efficient prime factorization can be done by first pre-computing a sieve of Eratosthenes up to a certain limit. Then, iterate through the primes in the sieve to find the prime factors of L. If L is still greater than 1 after this, it must either be a large prime number or have larger prime factors, which can be handled separately with trial division or probabilistic primality tests.\",\n    \"After finding the prime factorization L = p1^e1 * p2^e2 * ... * pk^ek, the number of pairs (a, b) such that LCM(a, b) = L can be computed by considering all possible combinations of divisors. The formula for this can be derived from the properties of LCM and GCD, and involves the exponents of the prime factors.\",\n    \"Edge cases include L = 1, where there is only one pair (1, 1). When L is a prime number, the pairs are (1, L) and (L, L), so there are two pairs.  Also should consider when L has very large prime factors, requiring efficient trial division after the sieve.\",\n    \"Optimize the search for prime factors by using a precomputed sieve to quickly identify small prime factors. Only iterate up to the square root of L when searching for factors and handle the remaining large factor separately. Also, early exit from the factorization process if L becomes 1.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
