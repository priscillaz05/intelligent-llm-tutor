Your task is to complete the function findMatchedWords() which takes an array of strings dict[] consisting of the words in the dictionary and a string, Pattern and returns an array of strings consisting of all the words in the dict[] that match the given Pattern in lexicographical order.\\nExpected Time Complexity: O(N*K) (where K is the length of the pattern).\\nExpected Auxiliary Space: O(N).\\nConstraints:\\n1 <= N <= 10\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def findSpecificPattern(Dict, pattern):\\n\\tans = []\\n\\tfor i in Dict:\\n\\t\\tdic = {}\\n\\t\\tdic2 = {}\\n\\t\\tif len(i) == len(pattern):\\n\\t\\t\\tflag = True\\n\\t\\t\\tfor (j, k) in zip(i, pattern):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif j not in dic and k not in dic2:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdic[j] = k\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdic2[k] = j\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telif dic.get(j) != k or dic2.get(k) != j:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tflag = False\\n\\t\\t\\tif flag:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tans.append(i)\\n\\treturn ans\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding Problem Requirements: Recognize that the problem requires finding words from a dictionary that match a given pattern, where each character in the pattern maps uniquely to a character in the word.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Consider edge cases such as differing lengths between the word and the pattern or non-unique mappings between characters. Handle the case where the word and pattern have the same length but don't match the pattern.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Develop a strategy to check the mapping between the word and the pattern. Consider using two dictionaries to keep track of the mappings in both directions to ensure uniqueness.\\n- Implementing Mapping Validation: Make sure that if a character in the word maps to a character in the pattern, the reverse mapping must also hold true. The implementation should iterate through the pattern and corresponding word, maintaining mappings and flags to track validity.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for a word to 'match' the pattern, and what constraints define a valid mapping?\",\n    \"How do you handle cases where the lengths of the words and the pattern are different, and what should the function return in such scenarios?\",\n    \"Can you suggest a data structure to effectively keep track of the character mappings between the word and the pattern?\",\n    \"How will you ensure that the mapping is unique and consistent in both directions (word to pattern and pattern to word)?\",\n    \"How can you optimize your solution to handle edge cases or potentially large dictionaries efficiently while staying within the constraints of O(N*K) time complexity and O(N) auxiliary space?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"For a word to match the pattern, there should be a one-to-one correspondence between the characters in the word and the characters in the pattern. Each character in the pattern must map uniquely to a character in the word, and vice versa.\",\n    \"If the lengths of the word and the pattern are different, they cannot match, so the function should ignore that word and continue checking the remaining words.\",\n    \"Using two dictionaries, one to map characters from the word to the pattern and another to map characters from the pattern to the word, is an efficient way to track character mappings.\",\n    \"To ensure uniqueness and consistency, whenever a new mapping is encountered, add it to both dictionaries. Before adding a mapping, check if the character is already mapped to a different character; if it is, the mapping is invalid.\",\n    \"For efficiency, only words with the same length as the pattern should be considered. The dictionary lookups in the implementation must be implemented with O(1) complexity to meet the time complexity requirement. The overall auxiliary space needs to be limited to O(N).\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
