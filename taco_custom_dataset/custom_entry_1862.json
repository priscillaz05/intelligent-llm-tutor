"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"You are playing the following Bulls and Cows game with your friend: You write down a number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. Each time your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint that indicates how many digits in said guess match your secret number exactly in both digit and position (called \\\"bulls\\\") and how many digits match the secret number but locate in the wrong position (called \\\"cows\\\"). Your friend will use successive guesses and hints to eventually derive the secret number.\\n\\nWrite a function to return a hint according to the secret number and friend's guess, use A to indicate the bulls and B to indicate the cows.\\n\\nPlease note that both secret number and friend's guess may contain duplicate digits.\\n\\nExample 1:\\n\\n\\nInput: secret = \\\"1807\\\", guess = \\\"7810\\\"\\n\\nOutput: \\\"1A3B\\\"\\n\\nExplanation: 1 bull and 3 cows. The bull is 8, the cows are 0, 1 and 7.\\n\\nExample 2:\\n\\n\\nInput: secret = \\\"1123\\\", guess = \\\"0111\\\"\\n\\nOutput: \\\"1A1B\\\"\\n\\nExplanation: The 1st 1 in friend's guess is a bull, the 2nd or 3rd 1 is a cow.\\n\\nNote: You may assume that the secret number and your friend's guess only contain digits, and their lengths are always equal.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"class Solution:\\n\\n\\tdef getHint(self, secret, guess):\\n\\t\\ts_count = collections.defaultdict(int)\\n\\t\\tg_count = collections.defaultdict(int)\\n\\t\\tbull_cnt = 0\\n\\t\\tfor (s, g) in zip(secret, guess):\\n\\t\\t\\tif s == g:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbull_cnt += 1\\n\\t\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ts_count[s] += 1\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tg_count[g] += 1\\n\\t\\tcow_cnt = sum((min(s_count[x], g_count[x]) for x in g_count if x in s_count))\\n\\t\\treturn '{}A{}B'.format(bull_cnt, cow_cnt)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: Recognize that the goal is to count 'bulls' (digits in the correct position) and 'cows' (digits present but in the wrong position) between a secret number and a guess.\\n- Handling Duplicates: Acknowledge that both the secret and guess may contain duplicate digits and that these duplicates must be correctly accounted for when counting 'cows'.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: Implement a strategy to first count bulls by comparing digits at each position. Then, for non-bull digits, count cows by tracking the frequency of each digit in both the secret and guess. Calculate the number of cows based on the minimum frequency of shared digits.\\n- Edge Cases/Constraints: Account for the constraints that the lengths of the secret and guess are equal and that they contain only digits.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you differentiate between a 'bull' and a 'cow' in the context of this problem?\",\n    \"How would you handle duplicate digits in both the secret and guess to ensure accurate 'cow' counts?\",\n    \"What data structures can be useful for efficiently counting the occurrences of digits in the secret and guess strings?\",\n    \"How does the constraint that the lengths of the secret and guess are equal simplify the problem, and what if they were not equal?\",\n    \"Can you outline a step-by-step process to first identify and count bulls, and then count the cows accurately, while considering potential edge cases?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A 'bull' is a digit that is in the correct position in both the secret and guess. A 'cow' is a digit that exists in both the secret and guess but is in the wrong position.\",\n    \"For handling duplicate digits, I need to track the frequency of each digit in both the secret and the guess. When counting cows, I can only count a digit as a cow as many times as it appears in both the secret and the guess, taking the minimum frequency of that digit in both strings.\",\n    \"Dictionaries or hash maps (specifically, collections.defaultdict in Python) are useful for efficiently counting the occurrences of digits. They allow for constant-time lookups and updates of digit counts.\",\n    \"The constraint that the lengths are equal simplifies the problem by allowing direct comparison of digits at each index to identify bulls. If the lengths were not equal, I would need to handle cases where one string is shorter, adjusting the iteration and comparison logic accordingly.\",\n    \"1. Initialize bull count to 0. 2. Iterate through both strings, comparing digits at each position. If they match, increment the bull count. 3. For non-bull digits, track the frequency of each digit in the secret and the guess using dictionaries. 4. Iterate through the digits in the guess dictionary and, for each digit that also exists in the secret dictionary, add the minimum of their frequencies to the cow count. 5. Return the bull and cow counts in the format 'XA YB'.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
