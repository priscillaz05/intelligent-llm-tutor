Prefix notation places operators before operands (e.g., `* + A B C` means `(A+B)*C`). Infix places them between (e.g, `(A+B)*C`).\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: Use a stack. Iterate through the prefix expression *from right to left*. If you encounter an operand (a variable/number), push it onto the stack. If you encounter an operator, pop two operands from the stack, combine them with the operator (in the form `(operand1 operator operand2)`), and push the resulting string back onto the stack.\\n- Implementation Details:  The code needs to correctly identify operands and operators. It uses a list to simulate a stack. Remember that the iteration is right-to-left. Enclose each operation in parentheses to preserve precedence.\\n- Edge Cases and Constraints:  The problem states that the input is a *valid* prefix expression.  Therefore, we can assume that the expression is well-formed, meaning there will always be the right number of operands for each operator and that the stack won't be empty when trying to pop elements.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you recognize an operator versus an operand when reading the prefix expression?\",\n    \"Why is it crucial to iterate through the prefix expression from right to left?\",\n    \"Why are the parentheses needed around each operation?\",\n    \"What data structure is most appropriate for solving this problem, and why?\",\n    \"If the prefix expression was invalid, what could potentially go wrong in the implemented solution, and how could those issues be addressed?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"An operator is typically a symbol like '+', '-', '*', '/', or '^'. Operands are usually letters (variables) or numbers. A check can be implemented to see if the current character is in a set of valid operators.\",\n    \"Iterating from right to left ensures that the operands are in the correct order when combining them with the operator. The rightmost operands are the first to be encountered and therefore need to be processed first.\",\n    \"Parentheses ensure that the order of operations is maintained correctly in the infix expression. They explicitly define the precedence of operations, which is essential for the correct evaluation of the expression.\",\n    \"A stack is the most suitable data structure because it allows us to store and retrieve operands in the reverse order that they are encountered, which is exactly what's needed when evaluating a prefix expression from right to left.\",\n    \"If the prefix expression is invalid (e.g., more operators than operands), the stack might become empty while trying to pop operands, resulting in an error. This could be addressed by adding error handling to check if the stack has at least two elements before popping when an operator is encountered. Also, you could check at the end of the algorithm to make sure the stack contains exactly one element, the complete infix expression.  If it contains more than one element, that indicates an invalid input.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
