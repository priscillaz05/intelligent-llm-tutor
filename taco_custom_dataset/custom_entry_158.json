The special days in this problem are numbered from $1$ to $n$.\\n\\nThere are three values about each exam:  $s_i$ \u2014 the day, when questions for the $i$-th exam will be published,  $d_i$ \u2014 the day of the $i$-th exam ($s_i < d_i$),  $c_i$ \u2014 number of days Petya needs to prepare for the $i$-th exam. For the $i$-th exam Petya should prepare in days between $s_i$ and $d_i-1$, inclusive. \\n\\nThere are three types of activities for Petya in each day: to spend a day doing nothing (taking a rest), to spend a day passing exactly one exam or to spend a day preparing for exactly one exam. So he can't pass/prepare for multiple exams in a day. He can't mix his activities in a day. If he is preparing for the $i$-th exam in day $j$, then $s_i \\\\le j < d_i$.\\n\\nIt is allowed to have breaks in a preparation to an exam and to alternate preparations for different exams in consecutive days. So preparation for an exam is not required to be done in consecutive days.\\n\\nFind the schedule for Petya to prepare for all exams and pass them, or report that it is impossible.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ $(2 \\\\le n \\\\le 100, 1 \\\\le m \\\\le n)$ \u2014 the number of days and the number of exams.\\n\\nEach of the following $m$ lines contains three integers $s_i$, $d_i$, $c_i$ $(1 \\\\le s_i < d_i \\\\le n, 1 \\\\le c_i \\\\le n)$ \u2014 the day, when questions for the $i$-th exam will be given, the day of the $i$-th exam, number of days Petya needs to prepare for the $i$-th exam. \\n\\nGuaranteed, that all the exams will be in different days. Questions for different exams can be given in the same day. It is possible that, in the day of some exam, the questions for other exams are given.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nIf Petya can not prepare and pass all the exams, print -1. In case of positive answer, print $n$ integers, where the $j$-th number is:  $(m + 1)$, if the $j$-th day is a day of some exam (recall that in each day no more than one exam is conducted),  zero, if in the $j$-th day Petya will have a rest,  $i$ ($1 \\\\le i \\\\le m$), if Petya will prepare for the $i$-th exam in the day $j$ (the total number of days Petya prepares for each exam should be strictly equal to the number of days needed to prepare for it).\\n\\nAssume that the exams are numbered in order of appearing in the input, starting from $1$.\\n\\nIf there are multiple schedules, print any of them.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n5 2\\n1 3 1\\n1 5 1\\n\\nOutput\\n1 2 3 0 3 \\n\\nInput\\n3 2\\n1 3 1\\n1 2 1\\n\\nOutput\\n-1\\n\\nInput\\n10 3\\n4 7 2\\n1 10 3\\n8 9 1\\n\\nOutput\\n2 2 2 1 1 0 4 3 4 4 \\n\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first example Petya can, for example, prepare for exam $1$ in the first day, prepare for exam $2$ in the second day, pass exam $1$ in the third day, relax in the fourth day, and pass exam $2$ in the fifth day. So, he can prepare and pass all exams.\\n\\nIn the second example, there are three days and two exams. So, Petya can prepare in only one day (because in two other days he should pass exams).

Each exam has a start day for preparation, an exam day, and the number of preparation days needed. All exams must be completed, and each day can only have one activity.\\n- Data Structures: Use an array to represent the schedule, where each index corresponds to a day and the value represents the activity. Use a data structure (list of lists/arrays) to store exam details (start day, exam day, preparation days).\\n- Algorithm: Initialize a schedule array with rest days (0). Fill in the exam days with m+1. Iterate through the days and assign preparation days to exams, making sure the preparation is within the allowed range (start day to exam day - 1) and enough preparation days are available. If it's not possible to schedule all preparation days for all exams, return -1; otherwise, return the schedule.\\n- Edge Cases and Constraints: Check if the total preparation days required are feasible given the number of days and exams. Handle cases where it's impossible to prepare for all exams within the given time frame.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How should the input be processed and stored to efficiently access exam details and their associated constraints?\",\n    \"How can the schedule be built step-by-step while respecting the exam preparation time window?\",\n    \"How can feasibility be checked effectively before constructing a schedule?\",\n    \"How should the schedule be represented and what values should be used for each activity?\",\n    \"How can the algorithm determine if a valid schedule is impossible to construct?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The input should be parsed to extract n, m, and exam details. The exam details should be stored in a list of lists, where each inner list contains [start_day, exam_day, preparation_days, exam_index]. Exam details could be sorted based on the exam day. Remember to decrement the start and exam days by 1 to match the 0-based array indices.\",\n    \"The schedule can be built iteratively. First, mark exam days. Then iterate through the days. If it's not an exam day, find an exam needing preparation and whose preparation window includes the current day. Assign the day to prepare for that exam, decrementing the remaining preparation days for that exam. Ensure that only one exam is prepared for on any given day.\",\n    \"Before constructing the schedule, we can check if the total preparation days needed for all exams is less than or equal to the number of days that are not exam days (n - m). If not, it's impossible.\",\n    \"The schedule should be an array of length n, where each element represents a day. '0' signifies a rest day, 'm+1' signifies an exam day, and 'i' (1 <= i <= m) signifies preparation for the i-th exam.\",\n    \"The algorithm can determine that a valid schedule is impossible if, after attempting to schedule preparation days, there are still exams that require more preparation days than have been scheduled. Additionally, if it becomes impossible to find a valid exam to prepare for on a given day within the constraints (s_i <= day < d_i), the algorithm should conclude that no valid schedule exists.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
