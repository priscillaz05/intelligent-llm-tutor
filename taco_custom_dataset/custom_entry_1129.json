For each bit position, check if setting that bit in X would result in the AND being greater than X. If setting the bit results in a smaller number of changes, choose that setting.

If both bits are 1, the resulting bit is 1; otherwise, it's 0. The overall AND must result in a value strictly greater than X.\",\n    \"By iterating over bits from MSB to LSB, and calculating number of changes to A by including or excluding certain bits.\",\n    \"The array size N is up to 10^5, and element values are up to 10^9. This guides the complexity toward O(N * log(max(A))) by considering bit operations.\",\n    \"The minimum operations could remain N if no combination of bit modifications results in an AND value greater than X with fewer changes.\",\n    \"The algorithm intelligently flips relevant bits and calculate required change count. Then it compares this change count with results achieved so far, and take min of that.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
