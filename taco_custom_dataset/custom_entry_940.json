For example, if N = 4 the grid looks like:\\n\\nYou start at the top left corner of the grid, i.e, cell (1, 1). You would like to reach the bottom-right corner, cell (N, N). To do so, whenever you are at cell (i, j), you can move to either cell (i+1, j) or cell (i, j+1) provided that the corresponding cell lies within the grid (more informally, you can make one step down or one step right).\\n\\nThe *score* of a path you take to reach (N, N) is the sum of all the numbers on that path.\\n\\nYou are given an integer K that is either 0 or 1. Is there a path reaching (N, N) such that the parity of its score is K?\\n\\nRecall that the parity of an integer is the (non-negative) remainder obtained when dividing it by 2. For example, the parity of 246 is 0 and the parity of 11 is 1.

The value of a cell A[i,j] is i + N*(j-1). The score of a path is the sum of cell values in the path. We need to determine if there is a path whose score has parity K (0 or 1).\\n- Devising a Strategy: Consider the constraints and the nature of the grid's values. Any path from (1,1) to (N,N) will involve N-1 steps down and N-1 steps right, totaling 2*(N-1) steps. Analyze how the score of the path relates to N and the parity K.\\n- Analyzing the Path Sum: Realize that the sum of the values on the path is related to N. Observe that the minimum sum will occur when only the top row and rightmost column are visited. The maximum sum involves the leftmost column and bottom row.\\n- Determining the Parity Condition: Derive a condition based on N and K to determine if a path with parity K exists. The key observation is that the problem constraints simplify to checking the parity of N. If N is odd and K is 0, the answer is 'No', otherwise, the answer is 'Yes'.\\n- Edge Cases and Simplifications: Note the extreme cases when N = 1. The answer will be 'No' when N=1 and K=0 since the path sum is 1, which is odd. Otherwise, when N is greater than 1, the parity of the sum depends on N, and we can check the condition accordingly.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the total number of steps required to go from cell (1, 1) to cell (N, N) in the grid?\",\n    \"How can you represent the value of a cell (i, j) in terms of N, i, and j?\",\n    \"If N is odd, what can you say about the minimum possible score of any path from (1,1) to (N, N)?\",\n    \"If N is even, is it always possible to find a path with even score or a path with odd score?\",\n    \"Can you simplify the problem to derive a direct relationship between N, K, and the existence of a path with parity K?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"To go from (1, 1) to (N, N), you need to take N-1 steps down and N-1 steps right, so the total number of steps is 2 * (N - 1).\",\n    \"The value of a cell (i, j) is given by the formula A[i, j] = i + N * (j - 1).\",\n    \"If N is odd, the minimum score will be odd, which means that only an odd parity (K = 1) solution is possible.
