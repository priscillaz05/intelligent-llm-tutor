Their entangling and mesmerizing game style usually translates into very high ball possession, consecutive counter-attack plays and goals. Lots of goals, thanks to the natural talent of their attacker and best player in history, Lionel Andres Messi.\\nHowever, at the most prestigious tournament of individual teams, the UEFA Champions League, there are no guarantees and believe it or not, Barcelona is in trouble.... They are tied versus Chelsea, which is a very defending team that usually relies on counter-strike to catch opposing teams off guard and we are in the last minute of the match. So Messi decided to settle things down for good and now he is conducting the ball on his teams' midfield and he will start a lethal counter-attack :D\\nAfter dribbling the 2 strikers from Chelsea, he now finds himself near the center of the field and he won't be able to dribble the entire team on his own, so he will need to pass the ball to one of his teammates, run forward and receive the ball once again to score the final goal.\\nExactly K players are with him on his counter-attack and the coach, Tito Villanova knows that this counter-attack will end in a goal only if after exactly N passes are performed between the players, Messi ends up with the ball.\\n(Note that the ball only needs to end with Messi after exactly N passes are performed between all the K+1 players, i.e. Messi can receive the ball several times during the N passes. See the 2nd test case explanation for further clarification. ) \\nHowever, he realized that there are many scenarios possible for this, so he asked you, his assistant coach, to tell him in how many ways can Messi score the important victory goal. So help him!!\\n\\n-----Input-----\\nInput will contain a number T denoting the number of test cases.\\nThen T test cases follow, each one consisting of two space-sparated integers N and K.\\n\\n-----Output-----\\nFor each test case, output a single integer, the number of ways the winning play might happen modulo 1000000007 (109+7).\\n\\n-----Constraints-----\\n\\n- 1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\\n- 2 \u2264 N \u2264 1000\\n- 1 \u2264 K \u2264 10\\n\\n-----Example-----\\nInput:\\n2\\n2 4\\n4 2\\n\\nOutput:\\n4\\n6\\n\\n-----Explanation-----\\nIn the first test case, say four players with Messi are Xavi, Busquets, Iniesta and Jordi Alba. Then the ways of the winning play to happen when exactly  2 passes are to be performed are:\\n1) Messi - Xavi - Messi\\n2) Messi - Busquets - Messi\\n3) Messi - Iniesta - Messi\\n4) Messi - Alba - Messi\\n\\nIn the second test case, also say that two players with Messi are Xavi and Iniesta. There are 6 ways for the winning play to happen when exactly 4 passes are performed. All the examples of such winning play are:\\n1) Messi - Xavi - Messi - Iniesta - Messi\\n2) Messi - Xavi - Iniesta - Xavi - Messi\\n3) Messi - Xavi - Messi - Xavi - Messi\\n4) Messi - Iniesta - Messi - Iniesta - Messi\\n5) Messi - Iniesta - Messi - Xavi - Messi\\n6) Messi - Iniesta - Xavi - Iniesta - Messi\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"t = int(input())\\nfor i in range(t):\\n\\t(n, k) = map(int, input().split(' '))\\n\\tsum = 0\\n\\tz = 0\\n\\twhile n > 1:\\n\\t\\tsum += k ** (n - 1) * (-1) ** z\\n\\t\\tn -= 1\\n\\t\\tz += 1\\n\\tprint(sum % 1000000007)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding Problem Requirements: Read and understand the problem statement. Recognize that the goal is to find the number of ways Messi can score after N passes with K other players, modulo 1000000007.\\n- Devising a Strategy: Consider using dynamic programming. Define dp[i][j] as the number of ways to have the ball with player j after i passes. Messi is player 0. We want dp[N][0].\\n- Implementing the DP Solution: Initialize dp[0][0] = 1, meaning at the start, Messi has the ball. Then iterate for i from 1 to N, and for each player j from 0 to K, update dp[i][j] based on who had the ball at i-1. If j is Messi (0), the ball can come from any of the K other players. If j is not Messi, the ball can come from Messi.\\n- Optimizing for Modulo: Ensure that modulo operations are applied at each step to avoid integer overflow.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Make sure N >= 2 and K >= 1. Also check the constraints for T.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can we model the passes between Messi and his K teammates using a mathematical or programmatic approach?\",\n    \"How do we handle the modulo operation to prevent integer overflow, and at what steps should it be applied?\",\n    \"Can dynamic programming be used here, and if so, how would you define the states and transitions?\",\n    \"How would you initialize your data structure and how should that initialization influence the final result?\",\n    \"What are the key conditions that must be true after each pass to guarantee a legal sequence?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The passes can be modeled as transitions between players. Let dp[i][j] be the number of ways the ball can be with player j after i passes. Messi is player 0.\",\n    \"The modulo operation should be applied after each addition or multiplication to keep the intermediate results within the bounds of the integer type. So use (a + b) % MOD or (a * b) % MOD\",\n    \"Yes, dynamic programming can be used. dp[i][j] represents the number of ways the ball is with player j after i passes. dp[i][0] = sum(dp[i-1][1...K]) and dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][0] for j from 1 to K.\",\n    \"We initialize dp[0][0] = 1, indicating Messi starts with the ball and dp[0][i] = 0 for i>0. Then from there we iterate.  This indicates a starting state where only messi has the ball at pass 0.  This affects all calculated sums in subsequent dp steps.\",\n    \"After each pass, one of the K+1 players must have the ball, and the previous pass must have been from a different player if you're not Messi, and to Messi if the current holder is not Messi.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
