We need to determine who is the first one unable to give the required number of candies.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints: The main constraint is that a and b are between 1 and 10^9, and the number of candies given increases by 1 each turn. We need to simulate the process until one of them runs out of candies.\\n- Choosing an Appropriate Data Structure and Algorithm: Since the numbers are large, a simple iterative approach works best. We can keep track of whose turn it is and subtract the appropriate amount of candies from their initial amounts.\\n- Implementing the Solution: Simulate the turns, subtracting candies from `a` if it's Vladik's turn (odd turn) and from `b` if it's Valera's turn (even turn). Increment the number of candies to be given each turn. Check at each turn if `a` or `b` becomes negative. Return the name of the person who ran out of candies first.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the possible values for a and b, and how might this affect the choice of data types?\",\n    \"How can we efficiently determine whose turn it is to give candies?\",\n    \"What condition should we check at each turn to determine the outcome of the game?\",\n    \"How can the turn counter be used to determine who is giving the candies in each round?\",\n    \"What should the program output if 'a' becomes negative, and what if 'b' becomes negative?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"a and b are between 1 and 10^9, so integer types are sufficient.\",\n    \"We can use the modulo operator (%) on the turn number. An odd turn represents Vladik, and an even turn represents Valera.\",\n    \"We should check if a or b becomes negative after each turn, which means that person cannot give enough candies.\",\n    \"A turn counter starting at 1 can be incremented each turn. When the turn counter is odd, Vladik gives candies. When the turn counter is even, Valera gives candies.\",\n    \"If 'a' becomes negative, the program should output \\\"Vladik\\\".
