The number resulted will be the number of contestants advancing to the next round.\\nFor example, when X = 2378, the number of contestants advancing to the next round will be 578 (if 2 and 3 are chosen), 2108 (if 3 and 7 are chosen), or 2315 (if 7 and 8 are chosen).\\nWhen X = 100, the number of contestants advancing to the next round will be 10, no matter which two digits are chosen.\\n* The preliminary stage ends when 9 or fewer contestants remain.\\n\\n\\nRingo, the chief organizer, wants to hold as many rounds as possible.

The reduction is determined by summing two adjacent digits. The input describes the initial number of contestants using a sequence of digits and their counts. The goal is to find the maximum number of rounds that can be played.\\n- Devising a Strategy: Each round effectively reduces the number of digits by one, but increases the total sum of the digits if two digits are summed into a value greater than the maximum of the two. The process stops when there are 9 or fewer contestants, so we want to reduce the number until the contestant numbers are between 1 and 9. The number of rounds will be the number of digits in the initial contestant numbers - 1 plus the number of times the sum of the digits can be divided by 9 before the number is less than or equal to 9.\\n- Edge Cases and Constraints: The constraints on digit counts and the digits themselves need to be considered. It's also crucial to note that the total number of digits can be very large (up to 10^15). Given the large constraints of the inputs, it's important to choose calculations that avoid large integer overflows.\\n- Implementation Details: Read the input and calculate the total number of digits (D) and the sum of the digits (S). Return D - 1 + (S - 1) // 9.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the core mechanic of the preliminary stage that determines how the number of contestants reduces from round to round?\",\n    \"Given that N is defined by digit-count pairs, how can you compute the total number of digits and the sum of all digits in N efficiently?\",\n    \"What is the relationship between the total number of digits in N and the number of rounds played, and how do you handle the sum of digits in N?\",\n    \"How does the stopping condition (9 or fewer contestants remaining) influence the overall strategy to find the maximum number of rounds?\",\n    \"What are the key constraints that need to be accounted for in your computations to ensure correctness and efficiency?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The number of contestants is reduced in each round by summing two consecutive digits in the current contestant count, effectively reducing the number of digits by one.\",\n    \"The total number of digits is the sum of all counts c_i. The sum of the digits is the sum of d_i * c_i for all i.\",\n    \"Each round reduces the total digits by one, so the maximum number of rounds can be at most the total digits minus one. Additionally, after each round the sum may decrease if sum of two adjacent digits is less than original digits' sum. The number of times we can reduce to get to 9 is roughly (sum - 1) // 9 plus the initial rounds by reduction in the number of digits.\",\n    \"The stage ends when there are 9 or fewer contestants. This condition implies that we need to continue reducing until this condition is satisfied. So the maximum number of rounds is the number of times digits can be summed up until the final contestant number is less than or equal to 9.\",\n    \"Constraints such as 1 <= M <= 200000, 0 <= d_i <= 9, d_1 != 0, d_i != d_{i+1}, c_i >= 1, and 2 <= c_1 + ... + c_M <= 10^15 need to be carefully considered. The large values for c_i and the overall digit count might cause integer overflow if not handled correctly. Additionally, it is crucial to account for the conditions under which the contestants reduce.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
