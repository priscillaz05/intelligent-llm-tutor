Using this string of numeric values, you can predict how many years it will take before your dream comes true. Cut up the string into more than one segment and compare their values. The difference between the largest and smallest value will give you the number of years before your wish will be fulfilled. Therefore, the result varies depending on the way you cut up the string. For example, if you are given a string 11121314 and divide it into segments, say, as 1,11,21,3,14, then the difference between the largest and smallest is 21 - 1 = 20. Another division 11,12,13,14 produces 3 (i.e. 14 - 11) years. Any random division produces a game of luck. However, you can search the minimum number of years using a program.\\n\\nGiven a string of numerical characters, write a program to search the minimum years before your wish will be fulfilled.\\n\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe input is given in the following format.\\n\\nn\\n\\nAn integer n is given.

The partitions must consist of contiguous digits from the original string.\\n- Edge Cases: The input number can be from 2 to 100,000 digits.  There are no leading zeros.\\n- Devise a strategy: The primary strategy involves exploring different ways to partition the string and calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum values obtained from the partitions. A brute force method would involve trying all possible partitions. Optimization may be necessary considering the size of the input string.\\n- Consider various partition sizes, starting from length 1 up to the whole string. For each partition, calculate the numerical value of the substring. Then, find the maximum and minimum values among these and record their difference. Keep track of the minimum difference found so far, and return it at the end.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How should I handle very large input strings to prevent time limit exceeded errors?\",\n    \"Is there a dynamic programming approach that could be applicable to optimize the partition exploration?\",\n    \"What are the key edge cases to consider when the input string has very few digits?\",\n    \"How do I ensure correct handling of large numerical values to avoid integer overflow issues?\",\n    \"How do I minimize the number of comparisons to improve the efficiency of identifying max and min partitioned numbers?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"For very large input strings, consider pruning the search space by setting upper bounds on partition lengths. For example, consider at most lengths 1, 2, and maybe 3 or some other strategy based on initial inspection to avoid exploring unnecessary partitions.\",\n    \"Dynamic programming might not be directly applicable since we're seeking to minimize the difference between max and min segmented numbers rather than optimizing a cumulative or recursive function. However, memoization might help to avoid repeated calculations of substring values.\",\n    \"When the input has very few digits (e.g., 2 or 3), exhaustive exploration becomes more feasible without significant time complexity concerns. Be sure to try both lengths of each substring as a comparison.\",\n    \"If the numerical values are too big to fit into integers, you will need to either handle them as strings (which makes magnitude comparisons tricky) or use Python's built-in arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic.\",\n    \"One could keep track of running maximum and minimum segmented numbers and then update them during the iteration through possible segmentations. Additionally, when you identify a lower minimal difference, you might employ bounds to prevent exploring segmentations that cannot improve on the lowest minimal difference found so far.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
