Additionally, for any pair of indices i and j where a_i = a_j, the XOR of elements a_i to a_j must equal K.\\n- Identifying Invalid Conditions: There are specific conditions where no solution exists. These need to be checked first. If K is 0, the solution is simple: a sequence of repeated pairs of integers incrementing by 1 for each pair. If K is greater or equal to 2^M or M is less than or equal to 1, there's no solution.\\n- Constructing the Sequence: If K is not 0 and M > 1, constructing the sequence becomes more intricate. We need a sequence such that each number in the range 0 to 2^M - 1 appears twice, and the XOR between the repeating number equals K. A useful pattern is to insert K between repetitions of the first number in the range, then K at nearly the end of the sequence, then build a symmetrical arrangement between the two K values.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the necessary conditions for the sequence to be valid, specifically regarding the occurrence of each number and the XOR sum between repetitions?\",\n    \"How does the value of K and M influence the feasibility of constructing a valid sequence, and what are the cases where a solution is not possible?\",\n    \"What is the strategy for constructing the sequence when K is not zero, taking into account the XOR condition?\",\n    \"How can we make sure all numbers appear twice?\",\n    \"How to ensure the xor condition is met\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Each integer from 0 to 2^M - 1 must appear exactly twice in the sequence.
