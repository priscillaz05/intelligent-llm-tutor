They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $1$ plays against team $2$, team $3$ plays against team $4$, and so on (so, $2^{n-1}$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $2^{n-1}$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $2^{n-2}$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \\\"$1$ vs $2$\\\" plays against the winner of the game \\\"$3$ vs $4$\\\", then the winner of the game \\\"$5$ vs $6$\\\" plays against the winner of the game \\\"$7$ vs $8$\\\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains.\\n\\nThe skill level of the $i$-th team is $p_i$, where $p$ is a permutation of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $2^n$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $1$ to $2^n$ occurs exactly once).\\n\\nYou are given a string $s$ which consists of $n$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:\\n\\nif $s_i$ is equal to 0, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;\\n\\nif $s_i$ is equal to 1, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins.\\n\\nLet's say that an integer $x$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $p$ such that the team with skill $x$ wins the tournament.

The string 's' determines whether the higher or lower skill level wins in each round. The goal is to find all skill levels that can potentially win the tournament.\\n- Identifying Constraints and Edge Cases: The constraints are that $1 \\\\le n \\\\le 18$, meaning the number of teams can be quite large. The string 's' determines the winner in each phase, which affects which skill levels have the potential to win. Need to account for cases where all rounds favor higher or lower skill levels.\\n- Devising a Strategy: The approach is to determine the minimum and maximum skill levels that can win the tournament. If a round favors higher skill levels ('1'), the minimum winning skill level increases. If a round favors lower skill levels ('0'), the maximum winning skill level decreases. The possible winning skill levels will be the range between the minimum and maximum, inclusive.\\n- Algorithm Implementation: Initialize the minimum and maximum winning skill levels. Iterate through the string 's'. If the character is '1', update the minimum winning skill level by adding $2^{i-1}$ where 'i' is the round number. If the character is '0', update the maximum winning skill level by subtracting $2^{i-1}$. Finally, print the range of winning skill levels from the calculated minimum to the calculated maximum.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does the string 's' influence the winning skill levels, and how can this be quantified?\",\n    \"How can the minimum and maximum winning skill levels be updated based on the outcome of each round as specified by the string 's'?\",\n    \"What edge cases should be considered, and how might they affect the range of winning integers?\",\n    \"How can the range of winning integers be efficiently determined once the minimum and maximum possible winning skill levels are known?\",\n    \"Can you explain the role of the tournament phases and how each character in 's' corresponds to a phase's rule for determining the winner?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Each character in 's' indicates whether the higher or lower skill wins in each phase. '1' means higher skill wins, and '0' means lower skill wins. This affects which teams can advance, thereby shaping the possible skill level ranges that can ultimately win.\",\n    \"For each '1' in 's', the minimum skill level increases by $2^{i-1}$ (where i is the index/round number). For each '0', the maximum skill level decreases by $2^{i-1}$.\",\n    \"Cases where all rounds favor higher or lower skill levels. If all are '1', the lower end of the skill levels gets higher. If all are '0', the higher end of the skill levels get lower.  Also cases of n=1 and n=0 (which is invalid).  Also k > length of array.\",\n    \"Once the minimum and maximum possible winning skill levels are determined, the range of winning integers is simply all integers between (and including) the minimum and maximum.  The solution should iterate from min to max, inclusive.\",\n    \"Each character $s_i$ in the string corresponds to the $i$-th phase of the tournament. If $s_i$ is '0', it means in that phase, the lower skill level wins. If it's '1', the higher skill level wins. The $i$-th phase has $2^{n-i}$ games. The outcome of each phase narrows down the range of potentially winning skill levels.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
