To ensure that there are no disputes between the contractors it has been decided that if two stations, say $A$ and $B$, are assigned to a particular contractor then all the stations that lie on the route from $A$ to $B$ will also be awarded to the same contractor.\\nThe government would like the assignment of stations to the contractors to be as equitable as possible. The government has data on the number of passengers who pass through each station each year. They would like to assign stations so that the maximum number of passengers passing through any contractor's collection of stations is minimized.\\nFor instance, suppose the railway network is as follows, where the volume of passenger traffic is indicated by the side of each station.\\n\\nOne possible assignment would to award stations $1$ and $3$ to one contractor (there by giving him a traffic of $35$ passengers), station $2$ to the second contractor (traffic of $20$) and stations $4, 5$ and $6$ to the third contractor (traffic of $100$). In this assignment, the maximum traffic for any one contractor is 100. On the other hand if we assigned stations $1, 2$ and $3$ to one contractor, station $4$ and $6$ to the second contractor and station $5$ to the third contractor the maximum traffic for any one contractor is $70$. You can check that you cannot do better. (The assignment $1$, $2$ and $3$ to one contractor, $4$ to the second contractor, and $5$ and $6$ to the third contractor has a lower value for the maximum traffic ($55$) but it is not a valid assignment as the route from $5$ to $6$ passes through $4$.)\\n\\n-----Input:-----\\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $N$ indicating the number of railways stations in the network. The stations are numbered $1,2,..., N$. This is followed by $N$ lines of input, lines $2,3,...,N+1$, indicating the volume of traffic at each station. The volume of traffic at station $i$, $1 \\leq i \\leq N$, is given by a single integer in line $i+1$. The next $N-1$ lines of input, lines $N+2, N+3, ..., 2 \\cdot N$, describe the railway network. Each of these lines contains two integers, denoting a pair of stations that are neighbours.\\n\\n-----Output:-----\\nThe output should be a single integer, corresponding to the minimum possible value of the maximum traffic of any contractor among all valid assignment of the stations to the three contractors.\\n\\n-----Constraints:-----\\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 3000$.\\n\\n-----Sample Input-----\\n6\\n10\\n20\\n25\\n40\\n30\\n30\\n4 5\\n1 3\\n3 4\\n2 3\\n6 4\\n\\n-----Sample Output-----\\n70\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"n = int(input())\\ncost = []\\nd = {}\\nval_desc = [0] * n\\nvisited = set()\\nvisited.add(0)\\ndfstack = []\\ndesc = [[False for i in range(n)] for i in range(n)]\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\tcost.append(int(input()))\\n\\td[i] = []\\nfor i in range(n - 1):\\n\\t(j, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))\\n\\td[j - 1].append(k - 1)\\n\\td[k - 1].append(j - 1)\\n\\ndef dfs(u):\\n\\tval_desc[u] += cost[u]\\n\\tdfstack.append(u)\\n\\tfor i in dfstack:\\n\\t\\tdesc[u][i] = True\\n\\tfor i in d[u]:\\n\\t\\tif i not in visited:\\n\\t\\t\\tvisited.add(i)\\n\\t\\t\\tdfs(i)\\n\\t\\t\\tval_desc[u] += val_desc[i]\\n\\tdfstack.pop(-1)\\ndfs(0)\\nmp = 10 ** 9\\ncoco = sum(cost)\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\tfor j in range(i + 1, n):\\n\\t\\tvali = val_desc[i]\\n\\t\\tvalj = val_desc[j]\\n\\t\\tif desc[i][j]:\\n\\t\\t\\tvalj -= val_desc[i]\\n\\t\\tif desc[j][i]:\\n\\t\\t\\tvali -= val_desc[j]\\n\\t\\tp = max(vali, valj, coco - vali - valj)\\n\\t\\tmp = min(mp, p)\\nprint(mp)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem asks us to divide a railway network into three sections, each managed by a contractor. The network has a tree structure (exactly one route between stations). The goal is to minimize the maximum passenger traffic handled by any contractor, given traffic at each station. The stations assigned to a contractor must form a connected path.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints: Each station must be assigned to exactly one contractor. If two stations are assigned to the same contractor, all stations on the path between them must also be assigned to the same contractor (connectivity constraint).\\n- Choosing an Algorithmic Strategy: Since the network is a tree, and we need to divide it into three connected components, it is equivalent to finding two edges to remove. Removing these two edges will create three separate connected components (contractor assignments). The problem boils down to finding the best two edges to remove such that the maximum sum of passenger traffic in any of the three resulting components is minimized. A depth-first search can be used to calculate the traffic for each subtree. After this, we need to iterate through all possible pairs of edges to remove and find the minimal maximum load.\\n- Implementing Depth First Search:  Perform DFS to compute the total traffic for each subtree. Use the `desc` matrix to record which nodes are descendants of others. This can be done while performing the DFS. The desc matrix indicates whether node j is a descendant of node i.\\n- Finding Optimal Edge Cuts: Iterate through all possible pairs of nodes. For each pair, calculate the traffic for each component based on subtree values calculated by the DFS. Compute `max(component1_traffic, component2_traffic, component3_traffic)` and find the minimum such value.\\n- Edge Cases and Simplifications: Consider edge cases such as a single node, or nodes with small traffic volumes. There are no obvious simplifications.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you represent the railway network as a data structure to easily traverse and determine paths between stations?\",\n    \"What data structure would be most suitable for storing passenger traffic data for each station, and how would you access it during the algorithm?\",\n    \"How can Depth First Search (DFS) be used to efficiently calculate the total passenger traffic within subtrees?\",\n    \"After performing DFS, what steps would you take to determine the optimal edge cuts that minimize the maximum traffic for any contractor?\",\n    \"How would you handle the connectivity constraint to ensure that each contractor manages a connected segment of the railway network?\",\n    \"What are some potential edge cases that could affect the algorithm's correctness or efficiency, and how would you address them?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The railway network can be represented as an adjacency list or dictionary where each key is a station, and the value is a list of its neighboring stations. This representation allows for easy traversal using graph algorithms like DFS or BFS.\",\n    \"A list or array can store the passenger traffic data for each station, indexed by the station number. Accessing this data during the algorithm is straightforward by using the station number as the index.\",\n    \"DFS can be used to recursively traverse the railway network starting from an arbitrary root node. As it traverses, it can sum the passenger traffic for each station in the subtree rooted at the current node, providing a way to calculate the total traffic within subtrees efficiently.\",\n    \"After DFS, iterate through all possible pairs of edges (stations). For each pair, calculate the traffic for each of the three resulting components. To do this, use the pre-computed subtree passenger traffic to determine the total traffic for each component.\",\n    \"During edge cutting, ensure that the contractor segment remains connected. The DFS will indicate the parent-child relationships between stations.  Using the `desc` matrix to ensure a contractor is assigned all nodes in a path will address the connectivity constraint.\",\n    \"Edge cases include networks with a small number of stations, zero traffic for some stations, and specific network topologies. Proper initialization and handling of boundary conditions can address these edge cases. Also, use Integer.MAX_VALUE as initial max value to find MIN, so the MIN logic works from the start and covers the zero node cases.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
