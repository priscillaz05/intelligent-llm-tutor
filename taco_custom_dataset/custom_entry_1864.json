The matrix is filled with numbers from 1 to (4n)^2 in a row-major order. The coils are formed by traversing the matrix in a spiral manner, one starting from the top-left and the other from the bottom-right.\\n- Constructing the Matrix: First, we need to create the 4n x 4n matrix and fill it with the appropriate values.\\n- Generating Coils: We need to traverse the matrix in a spiral manner, creating two coils, one starting from the top-left and another from the bottom-right. This involves defining the direction of traversal and handling boundary conditions.\\n- Directions and Boundary Checks: Defining the appropriate directions to move through the matrix and checking if the next move is within the bounds and unvisited is crucial for correctly forming the coils.\\n- Reversing the order: The given output examples show that the coils need to be in reverse order of their traversal.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you create the initial 4n x 4n matrix and populate it with the correct numerical sequence?\",\n    \"How do you define and implement the spiral traversal for both coils to capture the elements in the correct order?\",\n    \"What are the boundary conditions you need to consider when moving through the matrix to form the coils?\",\n    \"How do you manage the direction changes while creating the spiral coils, and ensure that you don't visit the same element twice?\",\n    \"Why is reversing the coils necessary, and how does this reversal contribute to fulfilling the problem's output requirements?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The matrix can be created using nested loops. Iterate through rows and columns, filling each cell with the value calculated as (row * 4n + column + 1).\",\n    \"Use a directional approach to traverse, maintaining the current position (row, col) for both coils. Use arrays to store the possible direction changes (e.g., right, down, left, up).  Change direction when the next move is out of bounds or when it encounters an already visited position.\",\n    \"Boundary conditions involve checking whether the next row/column index is within the range of [0, 4n-1]. Make sure the indices stay within these bounds.\",\n    \"Maintain a 'visited' matrix to track already visited cells. When the next move in the current direction is invalid (out of bounds or visited), change the direction using a modulo operator to cycle through the possible directions.\",\n    \"Reversing the order is necessary to match the output format described in the examples, which asks for the coils to be listed in the reverse order of their traversal during the spiral formation.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
