Tomorrow, he has an exam on algorithms and data structures. One of the algorithms he is required to study is the Hungarian algorithm (you do not have to know this algorithm to solve this problem).\\n\\nIn the Hungarian algorithm, you start with a matrix of positive integers with $N$ rows (numbered $1$ through $N$) and $N$ columns (numbered $1$ through $N$). The algorithm proceeds in steps.\\n\\nIn the first step, for each row of the matrix, you should find the smallest element in this row (let's denote it by $A$) and subtract $A$ from each element of the matrix in this row.\\n\\nIn the second step, for each column of the matrix, you should find the smallest element in this column (let's denote it by $A$) and subtract $A$ from each element in this column. The remaining steps of the algorithm are not relevant in this problem.\\n\\nCurrently, Chef is practicing implementation of the first two steps of the algorithm. He wants you to check if he is doing these two steps correctly or not. You are given a matrix with $N$ rows and $N$ columns; let's denote the element of this matrix in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column by $a_{i, j}$. Determine if this matrix can be the result of applying the first two steps of the Hungarian algorithm on some matrix.\\n\\n------  Input ------\\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.

For each $i$ ($1 \u2264 i \u2264 N$), the $i$-th of the following $N$ lines contains $N$ space-separated integers $a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2}, \\\\ldots, a_{i, N}$.\\n\\n------  Output ------\\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string \\\"YES\\\" (without quotes) if the given matrix can be a result of the first two steps or \\\"NO\\\" (without quotes) if it cannot.\\n\\n------  Constraints  ------\\n$1 \u2264 T \u2264 10,000$\\n$2 \u2264 N \u2264 500$\\n$0 \u2264 a_{i, j} \u2264 10^{3}$ for each valid $i, j$\\nthe sum of $N^{2}$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\\\cdot 10^{6}$\\n\\n----- Sample Input 1 ------ \\n5\\n3\\n0 0 4\\n3 0 1\\n0 1 0\\n2\\n0 5\\n3 2\\n2\\n1 3\\n5 0\\n3\\n0 3 4\\n4 0 5\\n6 5 0\\n4\\n3 0 2 4\\n0 2 3 5\\n3 4 3 0\\n3 4 0 3\\n----- Sample Output 1 ------ \\nYES\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\n----- explanation 1 ------ \\nExample case 1: Let's consider the matrix\\n\\n3 1 5\\n7 2 3\\n5 4 3\\n\\nand apply the first two steps of the Hungarian algorithm on it.\\n\\nIn the first step:\\n- the smallest integer in row $1$ is $1$\\n- the smallest integer in row $2$ is $2$\\n- the smallest integer in row $3$ is $3$\\n\\nAfter subtracting, the matrix becomes\\n\\n2 0 4\\n5 0 1\\n2 1 0\\n\\nand the second step is performed on this matrix.

The Hungarian algorithm involves first subtracting the minimum value of each row from all elements in that row, and then subtracting the minimum value of each column from all elements in that column.\\n- Identifying Key Properties: If a matrix is the result of these two steps, then each row and each column must have at least one zero.  If any row doesn't have a zero, it couldn't have been generated by subtracting the row minimum.  The same logic applies to columns.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy:  The solution checks for the necessary conditions.  It iterates through the rows.  If a row has a zero, then mark the corresponding column as covered. After checking all rows, if all columns are covered it means that it's possible to arrive at the given matrix by applying first two steps of the Hungarian algorithm on some matrix.\\n- Edge Cases: Consider cases where the input matrix has no zeros. Consider cases with only one row or column. Make sure to handle constraints on T and N to optimize efficiency.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the necessary conditions for a matrix to be the result of applying the first two steps of the Hungarian algorithm?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently check if these conditions are met in the given matrix?\",\n    \"What happens if a row or column in the matrix doesn't contain any zeros?\",\n    \"How do you determine if all columns are 'covered' after iterating through the rows?\",\n    \"How should edge cases like matrices with no zeros or very small matrices be handled?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Each row and each column must contain at least one zero.\",\n    \"Iterate through each row and column and check for the presence of at least one zero.
