He wants to choose as many dishes as possible from the given list but while satisfying two conditions: \\n- He can choose only one type of dish.   \\n- No two chosen dishes should be adjacent to each other. \\nChef wants to know which type of dish he should choose from, so that he can pick the maximum number of dishes.\\nExample:\\n\\nGiven $N$=$9$ and $A$=$[1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]$.\\n\\nFor type 1, Chef can choose at most four dishes. One of the ways to choose four dishes of type 1 is $A_1$, $A_4$, $A_7$ and $A_9$.\\n\\nFor type 2, Chef can choose at most two dishes. One way is to choose $A_3$ and $A_5$.\\n\\nSo in this case, Chef should go for type 1, in which he can pick more dishes.\\n\\n-----Input:-----\\n- The first line contains $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\\n- For each test case, the first line contains a single integer $N$.\\n- The second line contains $N$ integers $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N. \\n\\n-----Output:-----\\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \u2015 the type of the dish that Chef should choose from. If there are multiple answers, print the smallest one.\\n\\n-----Constraints-----\\n- $1 \\le T \\le 10^3$\\n- $1 \\le N \\le 10^3$\\n- $1 \\le A_i \\le 10^3$\\n- Sum of $N$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $10^4\\n\\n-----Sample Input:-----\\n3\\n5\\n1 2 2 1 2\\n6\\n1 1 1 1 1 1\\n8\\n1 2 2 2 3 4 2 1\\n\\n-----Sample Output:-----\\n1\\n1\\n2\\n\\n-----Explanation:-----\\nTest case 1:\\n\\nFor both type 1 and type 2, Chef can pick at most two dishes. In the case of multiple answers, we pick the smallest one. Hence the answer will be $1$.\\nTest case 2:\\n\\nThere are only dishes of type 1. So the answer is $1$.\\nTest case 3:\\n\\nFor type 1, Chef can choose at most two dishes. For type 2, he can choose three dishes. For type 3 and type 4, Chef can choose the only dish available. Hence the maximum is in type 2 and so the answer is $2$.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"t = int(input())\\nf = 0\\ny = 0\\nfor _ in range(t):\\n\\tn = int(input())\\n\\tseq = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\\n\\tprev = seq[0]\\n\\tfor i in range(1, len(seq)):\\n\\t\\tif prev == seq[i]:\\n\\t\\t\\tseq[i] = 0\\n\\t\\tprev = seq[i]\\n\\tans = 0\\n\\tanss = 0\\n\\tfor el in seq:\\n\\t\\tif el != 0:\\n\\t\\t\\tc = seq.count(el)\\n\\t\\t\\tif ans < c:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tans = c\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanss = el\\n\\t\\t\\telif ans == c:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif el < anss:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tanss = el\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tanss = anss\\n\\tprint(anss)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem asks us to find the dish type that Chef can pick the most of, given the constraints that no two chosen dishes can be adjacent, and only one type of dish can be chosen.\\n- Identifying Subproblems: For each type of dish, determine the maximum number of non-adjacent dishes that can be picked. Then, choose the dish type that allows picking the most dishes. If there's a tie, choose the smallest dish type.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy:  Iterate through the distinct dish types. For each type, iterate through the array and use dynamic programming or a greedy approach to determine the maximum number of non-adjacent dishes. Keep track of the best dish type and its count so far. In the greedy approach, you either pick the current dish or skip it depending on adjacency. If the current type of dish is better than the current best dish type, then update the best dish type and count.  If they are the same, choose the smallest dish type between the current and the best.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Efficiently determine distinct dish types (using sets).  Handle edge cases: what if the array is empty? What if all dishes are adjacent?  What if the array is very large?\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can we efficiently find the distinct dish types present in the input array?\",\n    \"What is an efficient approach to find the maximum number of non-adjacent dishes of a given type?\",\n    \"How can we handle the tie-breaking condition where multiple dish types allow picking the same maximum number of dishes?\",\n    \"What edge cases should be considered, such as an empty input array or an array where no two dishes of the same type are non-adjacent?\",\n    \"What is the time complexity of your proposed approach and are there ways to optimize it given the constraints?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"We can use a set to efficiently store distinct dish types, avoiding duplicates. Iterate through the array once, adding each dish type to the set.\",\n    \"A dynamic programming approach can be used. Let `dp[i]` represent the maximum number of non-adjacent dishes up to index `i`. If `A[i]` is of the target type, then `dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + 1)`. If not, `dp[i] = dp[i-1]`.  A simpler greedy approach would be to simply keep track of the last picked dish. If a dish matches and is not adjacent to the last one picked, pick it.\",\n    \"While keeping track of the maximum count, also store the dish type that achieves that maximum. If we encounter another dish type that achieves the same maximum count, compare the two dish types and keep the smaller one.\",\n    \"If the input array is empty, return a default value (e.g., 0 or -1, depending on the problem context). If no two dishes of the same type are non-adjacent, it means we can pick at most one dish of each type, and we need to iterate through the distinct types to find the minimum.\",\n    \"The dominant operation is likely iterating through all of the dishes for each possible dish type (up to 1000 dish types each having up to 1000 elements). This means that the time complexity will be O(N*M) where N is the length of the array and M is the possible number of unique dishes. Given our contraints, N and M are equal, which ends up being O(N^2). Using memoization or precomputing the counts for certain dishes may help avoid running count multiple times.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
