He has decided to give the correct answer to the next question which will be asked by his Algorithms teacher.\\nThe question asked is:\\nFind the sum of alternate consecutive d$d$ odd numbers from the range L$L$ to R$R$ inclusive.\\nif d$d$ is 3 and L$L$ is 10 and R$R$ is 34, then the odd numbers between 10 and 34 are 11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25,27,29,31,33$11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25,27,29,31,33$, and the d$d$ alternate odd numbers are 11,13,15,23,25,27$11,13,15,23,25,27$.\\nYou are a friend of Kabir, help him solve the question.\\nNote:$Note:$ Number of odd number between L$L$ and R$R$ (both inclusive) is a multiple of d$d$.\\n\\n-----Input:-----\\n- First line will contain T$T$, number of test cases.  \\n- First line of each test case contains one integer d$d$ . \\n- Second line of each test case contains two space separated integer L$L$ and R$R$.\\n\\n-----Output:-----\\nFor each test case, print the sum modulo 1000000007.\\n\\n-----Constraints:-----\\n- 1\u2264T\u2264106$1 \\\\leq T \\\\leq 10^6$\\n- 1\u2264d\u2264103$1 \\\\leq d \\\\leq 10^3$\\n- 1\u2264L<R\u2264106$1 \\\\leq L < R \\\\leq 10^6$\\n\\n-----Sample Input:-----\\n1\\n3 \\n\\n10 33\\n\\n-----Sample Output:-----\\n114\\n\\n-----EXPLANATION:-----\\nSum of alternate odd numbers i.e, 11,13,15,23,25,27 is 114\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"for t in range(int(input().strip())):\\n\\td = int(input().strip())\\n\\t(L, R) = map(int, input().strip().split(' '))\\n\\tif L % 2 == 0:\\n\\t\\tL += 1\\n\\tsum = ((R - L + 2) // 2 // d + 1) // 2 - 1\\n\\tsum = sum * 2 * d * (sum + 1) * d + (sum + 1) * d * (L + d - 1)\\n\\tprint(sum % 1000000007)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem Requirements: The problem requires calculating the sum of alternate consecutive 'd' odd numbers within a given range [L, R]. The number of odd numbers in the range is a multiple of d. The final sum needs to be modulo 1000000007.\\n- Identifying Edge Cases and Constraints: L < R, 1 <= d <= 1000. Ensure correct handling of L if it's even (increment to next odd number). The number of test cases T can be up to 10^6, so the solution should be efficient.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: First, determine the number of groups of 'd' consecutive odd numbers in the range. Calculate the number of alternate groups to sum. Then calculate the sum using a formula based on arithmetic progression to optimize time complexity.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Apply modulo at each step to prevent overflow. Optimize the number of calculations inside the loop to meet the time constraint.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you ensure that L is odd before calculating the sequence of odd numbers?\",\n    \"How would you calculate the number of odd numbers in the range [L, R] inclusive?\",\n    \"Given the number of odd numbers and the value of 'd', how can you find the number of alternate groups of 'd' consecutive odd numbers?\",\n    \"What formula can you derive to calculate the sum of each group of 'd' consecutive odd numbers efficiently?\",\n    \"How can you optimize the modulo operation to prevent potential overflow issues?\",\n    \"How would you handle the time complexity given the large number of test cases?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"If L is even, increment it by 1 to make it odd.\",\n    \"The number of odd numbers in the range [L, R] is (R - L + 2) // 2.\",\n    \"Divide the number of odd numbers by d to find the number of groups, and then divide by 2 (integer division) to find the number of alternate groups.\",\n    \"The sum of d consecutive odd numbers starting from 'start' can be calculated as d * (start + start + 2 * (d - 1)) / 2 = d * (start + start + 2d - 2) / 2 = d*(start + d - 1).\",\n    \"Apply modulo operation after each arithmetic operation (addition, multiplication) to avoid exceeding integer limits. Example: (a * b) % mod = ((a % mod) * (b % mod)) % mod.\",\n    \"Minimize computations in the main loop. Precalculate values and use formulas to find the sum directly, instead of iterating through each number. Given the constraints, a solution with O(1) or O(log n) within each test case is expected.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
