Need to identify the measurement (e.g., \\\"1/2\\\", \\\"2\\\"), the unit (tbsp or tsp), and calculate the equivalent in grams, rounding up.\\n- Selecting an Appropriate Method: Regular expressions are useful for identifying and extracting the measurements and units from the recipe string. The `eval()` function can evaluate fractional measurements such as '1/2'. `math.ceil()` rounds a number upwards to its nearest integer.\\n- Implementing String Manipulation: Use `re.sub()` to find all occurrences of measurements in tbsp or tsp, and replace them with the original measurement plus its gram equivalent in parentheses.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you extract the numerical measurements (e.g., '2' or '1/2') and the units ('tbsp' or 'tsp') from the input string?\",\n    \"What is the conversion factor between tablespoons and grams, and teaspoons and grams?\",\n    \"How would you handle fractional measurements like '1/2'?\",\n    \"How do you ensure that the gram value is rounded up to the nearest integer?\",\n    \"How do you insert the calculated gram value back into the original string alongside the original measurement?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"I can use a regular expression to capture the measurement and the unit. The pattern should look for a number or fraction followed by 'tbsp' or 'tsp'.\",\n    \"1 tbsp is equal to 15 grams, and 1 tsp is equal to 5 grams.\",\n    \"I can use the `eval()` function to evaluate the fractional string as a number.\",\n    \"I can use the `math.ceil()` function to round the result of the conversion up to the nearest integer.\",\n    \"I can use string formatting (e.g., f-strings or the `%` operator) within the `re.sub()` replacement function to insert the calculated gram value into the original string, inside parentheses.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
