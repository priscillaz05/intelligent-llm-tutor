If no path exists, the output should be -1.\\n- Identifying Constraints: The number of nodes and edges are bounded. Edge costs are less than 1024. Nodes A and B are distinct.\\n- Choosing an Algorithmic Strategy: A binary search-like approach can be used to find the minimal penalty. The main idea is to check whether a path exists with a certain 'forbid' mask. Start with the highest bit of the possible penalty values (1024), and progressively refine the search. The `canreach` function determines if a path exists given a certain forbidden bitmask.\\n- Handling Graph Representation: Represent the graph using an adjacency list, where each node stores its neighbors and associated edge costs.\\n- Implementing Path Finding: The `canreach` function can be implemented using Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to determine if a path exists between the start and end nodes, given a specific forbidden bitmask.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you efficiently search for the minimum penalty among all possible paths between the start and end nodes?\",\n    \"How can you represent the graph structure to efficiently store nodes, edges, and their corresponding costs?\",\n    \"Given a 'forbid' bitmask, how can you determine if a path exists between two nodes where the bitwise AND of the path's edges' costs and the 'forbid' bitmask is equal to 0?\",\n    \"What is the significance of the upper bound of the edge costs (1024), and how can you utilize this information in the algorithmic strategy?\",\n    \"How do you handle the case where no path exists between the start and end nodes?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A binary search-like approach can be used to efficiently find the minimal penalty.
