All 7 colors must be used at least once. No four consecutive eggs can have the same color.\\n- Identifying the Pattern: Notice the minimum 'n' is 7, so we can use each color once initially (ROYGBIV). Then, since no four consecutive eggs can have the same color, we need to find a repeating sequence of at most 3 colors.\\n- Choosing a Repeating Substring: Since we have the ROYGBIV sequence established, we can use a sub-sequence of it to repeat the colors. A simple sequence that works is 'GBIV'.\\n- Implementing the Solution: Form the initial ROYGBIV. Find the number of times to repeat the sub-string 'GBIV'. Find the remaining eggs and add those to the string from the start of the 'GBIV' substring.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the minimum number of eggs to be painted, and how does this constraint affect your initial color choices?\",\n    \"Given that you must use all 7 colors, what is the base sequence you should start with?\",\n    \"Why is it sufficient to repeat a sequence of 4 colors (GBIV) after the initial 7?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the number of repetitions of the 4-color sequence?\",\n    \"What should you do when the number of remaining eggs is not a multiple of 4?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The minimum is 7. This means that all 7 colors must appear at least once, setting the base for the rest of the sequence.\",\n    \"The base sequence should be ROYGBIV to cover all the colors.\",\n    \"Repeating the GBIV allows us to extend the sequence without having four eggs in a row with the same color\",\n    \"The number of repetitions can be determined by taking the total number of eggs n, subtracting 7 (for ROYGBIV), and then integer dividing by 4: (n - 7) // 4\",\n    \"You take the remainder of (n - 7) % 4 to determine how many characters to extract from the beginning of the GBIV sequence.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
