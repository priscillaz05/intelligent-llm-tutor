The guys immediately decided to get across the river. Luckily, there was a boat by the river bank, just where the guys were standing. We know that the boat can hold people with the total weight of at most k kilograms.\\n\\nGreg immediately took a piece of paper and listed there the weights of all people in his group (including himself). It turned out that each person weights either 50 or 100 kilograms. Now Greg wants to know what minimum number of times the boat needs to cross the river to transport the whole group to the other bank. The boat needs at least one person to navigate it from one bank to the other. As the boat crosses the river, it can have any non-zero number of passengers as long as their total weight doesn't exceed k.\\n\\nAlso Greg is wondering, how many ways there are to transport everybody to the other side in the minimum number of boat rides. Two ways are considered distinct if during some ride they have distinct sets of people on the boat.\\n\\nHelp Greg with this problem.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line contains two integers n, k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 50, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 5000) \u2014 the number of people, including Greg, and the boat's weight limit. The next line contains n integers \u2014 the people's weights. A person's weight is either 50 kilos or 100 kilos.\\n\\nYou can consider Greg and his friends indexed in some way.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nIn the first line print an integer \u2014 the minimum number of rides. If transporting everyone to the other bank is impossible, print an integer -1.\\n\\nIn the second line print the remainder after dividing the number of ways to transport the people in the minimum number of rides by number 1000000007 (109 + 7). If transporting everyone to the other bank is impossible, print integer 0.\\n\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"from collections import deque\\n(n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]\\na = [int(i) for i in input().split()]\\nc50 = sum([1 for i in a if i == 50])\\nc100 = sum([1 for i in a if i == 100])\\nc = [[0] * 51 for i in range(51)]\\nc[0][0] = 1\\nc[1][0] = 1\\nc[1][1] = 1\\nfor x in range(2, 51):\\n\\tfor y in range(x + 1):\\n\\t\\tc[x][y] = c[x - 1][y - 1] + c[x - 1][y]\\nd = [[[[0, float('inf')] for l in range(2)] for i in range(c100 + 1)] for j in range(c50 + 1)]\\nd[0][0][0][0] = 1\\nd[0][0][0][1] = 0\\nq = deque()\\nq.append([0, 0, 0])\\nwhile len(q) > 0:\\n\\t(i, j, shore) = q.popleft()\\n\\tfor fifty in range(c50 - i + 1 if shore == 0 else i + 1):\\n\\t\\tfor hundreds in range(c100 - j + 1 if shore == 0 else j + 1):\\n\\t\\t\\tif fifty * 50 + hundreds * 100 > k or fifty + hundreds == 0:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontinue\\n\\t\\t\\ti1 = i + fifty if shore == 0 else i - fifty\\n\\t\\t\\tj1 = j + hundreds if shore == 0 else j - hundreds\\n\\t\\t\\tif d[i1][j1][1 ^ shore][1] > d[i][j][shore][1] + 1:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\td[i1][j1][1 ^ shore][1] = d[i][j][shore][1] + 1\\n\\t\\t\\t\\td[i1][j1][1 ^ shore][0] = 0\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tq.append((i1, j1, 1 ^ shore))\\n\\t\\t\\tif d[i1][j1][1 ^ shore][1] < d[i][j][shore][1] + 1:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontinue\\n\\t\\t\\tkoeff = (c[c50 - i][fifty] if shore == 0 else c[i][fifty]) * (c[c100 - j][hundreds] if shore == 0 else c[j][hundreds])\\n\\t\\t\\td[i1][j1][1 ^ shore][0] += d[i][j][shore][0] * koeff\\n\\t\\t\\td[i1][j1][1 ^ shore][0] %= 10 ** 9 + 7\\nif d[c50][c100][1][1] == float('inf'):\\n\\tprint(-1)\\n\\tprint(0)\\nelse:\\n\\tprint(d[c50][c100][1][1])\\n\\tprint(d[c50][c100][1][0])\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires finding the minimum number of boat trips needed to transport n people across a river, where each person weighs either 50 or 100 kg, and the boat has a weight limit k. Also need to find the number of distinct ways to transport people in the minimum number of trips.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints: Each person's weight is either 50 or 100. The boat must have at least one person on each trip. The total weight on the boat cannot exceed k. The number of people n is at most 50 and the boat's weight limit is at most 5000.\\n- Choosing an Algorithmic Strategy: A dynamic programming or breadth-first search (BFS) approach seems appropriate for finding the minimum number of trips.  BFS can model the transitions between states (number of 50kg and 100kg people on each side of the river), and DP can store and reuse optimal sub-solutions.  Combinations may be necessary to determine distinct ways.\\n- Identifying Data Structures: The number of 50kg people and 100kg people must be tracked.  A queue is used for BFS, and a 4D array dp[num_50][num_100][shore][rides/ways] where shore indicates which side the people are on, and rides/ways are the minimum number of rides and possible ways.\\n- Handling Combinations: The number of ways to choose people for the ride involves combination calculations. For instance, if there are x 50kg people and we choose y to go on the boat, then the combinations will be x choose y. The code needs to take the modulo with 1000000007\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you represent the state of the problem for applying dynamic programming or BFS?\",\n    \"How would you calculate the number of distinct ways, given that any two ways are considered distinct if during some ride they have distinct sets of people on the boat?\",\n    \"What is the base case for calculating the minimum number of rides?\",\n    \"How to account for combinations with large numbers and efficiently handle overflow or modulo arithmetic?\",\n    \"What are some edge cases that would make transporting the people impossible?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The state can be represented as a tuple (num_50, num_100, shore), where num_50 is the number of 50kg people on the initial shore, num_100 is the number of 100kg people on the initial shore, and shore indicates which side of the river the boat is on (0 for initial shore, 1 for the other shore).\",\n    \"The number of distinct ways can be determined using combinations. For each trip, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose the people going on the boat using combination formula nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!), where n is the number of people of a particular weight on the current shore and r is the number of people of that weight chosen to go on the boat.\",\n    \"The base case is when all people are on the initial shore (num_50 and num_100 are their initial values and shore = 0), and the number of rides is 0, and the number of ways is 1.\",\n    \"To handle combinations with large numbers efficiently and prevent overflow, we can precompute a combination table modulo 1000000007. During calculations, perform all arithmetic operations modulo 1000000007 to avoid overflow.\",\n    \"It is impossible to transport the people if the total weight of all people exceeds n*k or if the weight of every person in the group is greater than the boat's weight limit and n > 0 (meaning there is no possible selection of people that can go in the boat).\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
