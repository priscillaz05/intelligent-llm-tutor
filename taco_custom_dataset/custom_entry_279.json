Recognize that a number in the set S is considered 'prime' if it's not divisible by any other element in S (excluding itself).\\n- Handling Input: Parse the input to get the size of the set (N) and the elements of the set S.\\n- Iterating Through the Set: Iterate through each element in the set S and, for each element, check if it's divisible by any other element in the set.\\n- Checking Divisibility: For each number in the set, iterate through all other numbers in the set and check if the current number is divisible by the other number. Exclude the case where you're checking if a number is divisible by itself.\\n- Determining 'Primality': Keep track of whether a number is 'prime' or not. If it's not divisible by any other number in the set, mark it as 'prime'.\\n- Building the Result: Store the 'prime' numbers in the order they appear in the input. Concatenate the 'prime' numbers with spaces between them.\\n- Output: Print the resulting string of 'prime' numbers.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the definition of a 'prime' number in the context of this problem, and how does it differ from the traditional definition?\",\n    \"How should you handle the input to correctly parse the set size and the elements of the set?\",\n    \"How do you ensure that you are not checking if a number is divisible by itself when determining its 'primality'?\",\n    \"How should you format the output string to meet the problem's requirements?\",\n    \"What edge cases should be considered (if any), and how do they affect your solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A number X in set S is 'prime' if no other element in S (except X itself) is a divisor of X.
