A point is inside this area if l < x < r and y > a.\\n- Data Structures and Preprocessing: Consider using coordinate compression on the x-coordinates to reduce the memory usage and improve runtime, especially because the problem constraints allows points' x and y coordinates to be large (up to 10^9). Sorting the points based on either x or y will likely be necessary to efficiently iterate and process them.\\n- Key Algorithmic Idea: Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree. After sorting points by y-coordinate, process the points in increasing order of y.  For each y, count sets of points in the range (l, r) with y > a, where a is some value. Count pairs of such sets using BIT. Maintain the BIT updated so that at each y coordinate, the x coordinate count is up to date.\\n- In-Place Modification Concerns: Understand there are no constraints about in-place array modifications.\\n- Counting Sets: The core idea is to count the number of sets.  Sort points by y. Iterate the sorted points by increasing y coordinate.  Maintain a data structure to keep track of x coordinate availability, such that the number of points at (l, r) can be efficiently calculated.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can coordinate compression be useful for this problem, and how would you implement it?\",\n    \"After coordinate compression, how should you sort the points, and why is that sorting order important?\",\n    \"What data structure is most efficient for counting points within a range of x-coordinates, and how does it work in this context?\",\n    \"How does the Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) get updated as you process the points in increasing order of their y-coordinates, and why is this updating crucial?\",\n    \"How can the BIT's query function be used to determine the number of sets for each possible y-value, and how does this information contribute to the final answer?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Coordinate compression reduces the range of x-coordinates to be from 1 to the number of distinct x-coordinates. This is important because the original x-coordinates can be as large as 10^9, and using those directly as indices in a BIT would be memory-inefficient. Coordinate compression maps each x-coordinate to its rank among the distinct x-coordinates, allowing us to use a BIT with a smaller size.\",\n    \"The points should be sorted by their y-coordinates in ascending order. This allows us to process the points layer by layer, adding points with y > a to our BIT. By processing y-coordinates in this order, we ensure that the points considered for a particular 'a' value are only those above it, which matches the problem's requirements.\",\n    \"A Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree is efficient for counting points within a range of x-coordinates because it allows us to calculate prefix sums quickly. We can use BIT's update operation to add points based on the x coordinate. Then with a BIT's query function, we can count points between ranges of x coordinates.\",\n    \"As we process points with increasing y-coordinates, the BIT is updated by adding each point's compressed x-coordinate to the tree. The update operation increments the count at the corresponding index (compressed x-coordinate), indicating that a new point with a greater y-coordinate has been encountered. This updating is essential because it maintains a count of points within the range (l, r) for each y-value greater than a. \",\n    \"By querying the BIT with the compressed x-coordinates, we can determine the number of points with y-coordinates greater than the current value 'a' and lying within a specified x-range (l, r). This allows us to compute the total number of possible sets we can obtain for the selected range. With this result we need to calculate distinct sets by exclusion for each y coordinate. The number of sets with the specific y value need to be subtracted from the number of total sets up to that point.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
