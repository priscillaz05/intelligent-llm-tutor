To finish the work, he needs a resistor with a certain resistance value.\\n\\nHowever, all Mike has is lots of identical resistors with unit resistance R0 = 1. Elements with other resistance can be constructed from these resistors. In this problem, we will consider the following as elements: \\n\\n  1. one resistor; \\n  2. an element and one resistor plugged in sequence; \\n  3. an element and one resistor plugged in parallel. \\n\\n<image>\\n\\nWith the consecutive connection the resistance of the new element equals R = Re + R0. With the parallel connection the resistance of the new element equals <image>. In this case Re equals the resistance of the element being connected.\\n\\nMike needs to assemble an element with a resistance equal to the fraction <image>. Determine the smallest possible number of resistors he needs to make such an element.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe single input line contains two space-separated integers a and b (1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 1018).

The resistors can be combined in series (addition) or parallel (reciprocal addition). The fraction a/b is irreducible.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy:  Since we can connect resistors in series or parallel, this is analogous to repeatedly adding or taking reciprocals until we reach 1. A common algorithm for this type of problem involves the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD). The number of steps in the Euclidean algorithm relates to the number of resistors. Because the fraction a/b is irreducible, the GCD is 1, which ensures the process will terminate.\\n- Implementation Considerations:  Since a and b can be large (up to 10^18), standard recursive implementations of GCD might not be efficient. Using an iterative approach or tail recursion can help to avoid stack overflow issues. The code will perform a sequence of subtractions or divisions until the numbers become equal to one another, counting the operations needed.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does connecting resistors in series and parallel translate into mathematical operations on the resistance values?\",\n    \"Why is it important that the fraction a/b is irreducible, and how does this affect the solution?\",\n    \"Given that the values of a and b can be very large, what implications does this have for algorithm design?\",\n    \"How can the Euclidean algorithm be applied or adapted to solve this problem?\",\n    \"Can you walk through an example with a = 3 and b = 2 to illustrate how resistors can be combined and counted?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Connecting resistors in series corresponds to adding the resistance values, while connecting them in parallel corresponds to taking the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals (i.e., R = 1/(1/R1 + 1/R2)).\",\n    \"The fraction being irreducible (GCD(a, b) = 1) guarantees that the Euclidean algorithm will eventually reach a point where both numbers become equal, ensuring a finite solution is possible.\",\n    \"The large values of a and b suggest that algorithms with high time complexity should be avoided. Efficient iterative algorithms are preferred to prevent issues like stack overflow.\",\n    \"The number of operations performed by the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD(a, b), such as subtractions or divisions, correlates to the number of resistors required. For instance, repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger until they are equal is equivalent to the process of combining resistors.\",\n    \"For a = 3 and b = 2: Starting with 3/2, we can subtract 2/2 (equivalent to adding a resistor in series) once to get 1/2.  Then we take the reciprocal (equivalent to adding a resistor in parallel) to get 2/1 = 2. In order to arrive at a ratio of 1/1, we took one series, one parallel, then subtract (2-1) to get 1. So 1+1+1 resistors in total.  Another way could be one parallel and one series:  1/ (1/(1/2) + 1/1)  = 2/3, then do one series connection 2/3 + 1 = 5/3 (wrong way). The total is actually equal to a+b steps in the Euclidean algorithm, 3\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
