"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"In a cricket game, an over is a set of six valid deliveries of balls performed by one player \u2015 the bowler for this over.\\nConsider a cricket game with a series of $N$ overs (numbered $1$ through $N$) played by $K$ players (numbered $1$ through $K$). Each player may be the bowler for at most $L$ overs in total, but the same player may not be the bowler for any two consecutive overs. Assign exactly one bowler to each over in such a way that these rules are satisfied or determine that no such assignment exists.\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\\n- The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $N$, $K$ and $L$. \\n\\n-----Output-----\\nFor each test case:\\n- If there is no valid assignment of bowlers to overs, print a single line containing the integer $-1$.\\n- Otherwise, print a single line containing $N$ space-separated integers. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these integers should be the number of the player assigned as the bowler for the $i$-th over.\\n\\n-----Constraints-----\\n- $1 \\le T \\le 30$\\n- $1 \\le N, K, L \\le 10,000$\\n\\n-----Example Input-----\\n2\\n4 3 2\\n5 4 1\\n\\n-----Example Output-----\\n1 2 3 2\\n-1\\n\\n-----Explanation-----\\nExample case 1: The following is a valid assignment:\\n- Bowler 1 bowls the $1$-st over.\\n- Bowler 2 bowls the $2$-nd and $4$-th overs.\\n- Bowler 3 bowls the $3$-rd over.\\nIt is valid since no bowler bowls more than $2$ overs and each two consecutive overs have different bowlers.\\nExample case 2: There is no valid assignment in which each of $4$ players bowls at most $1$ over out of $5$.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"t = int(input())\\nfor i in range(t):\\n\\t(n, k, l) = map(int, input().split())\\n\\tif k * l < n:\\n\\t\\tprint(-1)\\n\\telif k == 1 and n > 1:\\n\\t\\tprint(-1)\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\ti = 0\\n\\t\\tfor t in range(n):\\n\\t\\t\\tif i == k:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ti = 1\\n\\t\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ti = i + 1\\n\\t\\t\\tprint(i, end=' ')\\n\\tprint('')\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem Constraints: The problem requires assigning bowlers to overs such that each bowler bowls at most L overs and no bowler bowls two consecutive overs. Need to determine if a valid assignment exists and output it if it does.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Recognizing that there might be cases where a valid assignment is not possible. Specifically, when the total overs that can be bowled (K * L) is less than the total overs (N) required, or when K is 1 and N > 1. Account for those edge cases.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: The provided solution checks for invalid scenarios first. If a solution is possible, it assigns bowlers in a round-robin fashion (1, 2, 3, ..., K, 1, 2, ...). This guarantees that no two consecutive overs are bowled by the same player because the bowlers are assigned cyclically.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Efficiently check the conditions for invalid assignments, and use a simple loop to assign bowlers in the round-robin manner when possible. The logic `if i == k: i = 1 else: i = i + 1` achieves the cyclic assignment.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the key constraints of the problem, and how do they influence the assignment of bowlers?\",\n    \"What conditions would make it impossible to find a valid assignment, and how can these conditions be checked?\",\n    \"What is a simple strategy to assign bowlers if a valid assignment is possible, and why does this strategy work?\",\n    \"How can the cyclic assignment of bowlers be implemented efficiently, and what happens when the bowler index reaches K?\",\n    \"Why does the condition `k == 1 and n > 1` result in no solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The constraints are that each bowler can bowl at most L overs and no bowler can bowl two consecutive overs. These constraints dictate how the bowlers are assigned in sequence and limit the total number of overs each bowler can bowl.\",\n    \"A valid assignment is impossible if the total overs that can be bowled (K * L) is less than the total overs (N), or if K is 1 and N > 1. These conditions can be checked at the beginning of the process, and the program can output -1 if either is true.\",\n    \"A simple strategy is to assign bowlers in a round-robin fashion (1, 2, 3, ..., K, 1, 2, ...). This works because it ensures that no two consecutive overs are bowled by the same player. Additionally, if k * l >= n, there are enough overs available to bowl n overs\",\n    \"The cyclic assignment can be implemented using a loop and an index that increments with each over. When the index reaches K, it resets to 1. The condition `if i == k: i = 1 else: i = i + 1` implements this.\",\n    \"If there is only one bowler (k == 1) and more than one over needs to be bowled (n > 1), then the only bowler would have to bowl consecutive overs which violates the rules. Therefore there is no solution.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
