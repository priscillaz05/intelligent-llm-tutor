Odd levels contribute positively, even levels negatively.\\n- Algorithm Selection: A level-order traversal using a queue is suitable for visiting nodes level by level. A boolean variable can toggle the sign based on whether the current level is odd or even.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: If the tree is empty (root is None), return 0.\\n- Implementing Level-Order Traversal: Use a queue to process nodes level by level. For each level, iterate through all nodes, add/subtract the node's value based on the level, and enqueue the children of each node.\\n- Level Tracking: Toggle a boolean variable after processing each level to indicate whether the next level is even or odd.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What approach would you use to traverse the binary tree level by level?\",\n    \"How would you keep track of whether the current level is even or odd?\",\n    \"What should the function return if the input tree is empty (root is None)?\",\n    \"How would you accumulate the sum of nodes at odd and even levels separately?\",\n    \"What data structure is suitable for level order traversal and why?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"I would use a level-order traversal, which visits all nodes at each level before moving on to the next level.\",\n    \"I can use a boolean variable that is toggled after each level to indicate whether the next level is even or odd.\",\n    \"If the root is None (the tree is empty), the function should return 0.\",\n    \"I can use a variable to store the overall difference, adding the node's value to the variable if it's an odd level and subtracting if it's an even level.\",\n    \"A queue is suitable as nodes are added to the queue level by level and then the nodes are processed and removed in the same order.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
