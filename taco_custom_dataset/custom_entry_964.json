Before processing a character, check if it exists in the set. If it doesn't, process it and add it to the set; otherwise, skip insertion.\",\n    \"Determine the ASCII value of the current character and iterate from the next uppercase letter (ASCII value + 1) up to 'Z' (ASCII value 90). Filter out the letters that are already in the original string.\",\n    \"A set is ideal for tracking processed characters because it provides O(1) lookup time. A dictionary could also be used if additional information about each character needs to be stored.\",\n    \"If the input string is empty, return an empty string. If all letters are unique, the algorithm will proceed normally, inserting appropriate letters after each character.\",\n    \"Use a list or a string builder to dynamically construct the output string. Append the original character first, then append the uppercase letters that need to be inserted. Finally, convert the list or string builder to a string.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
