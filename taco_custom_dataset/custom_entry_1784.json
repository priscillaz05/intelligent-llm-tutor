"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"Vasya is writing an operating system shell, and it should have commands for working with directories. To begin with, he decided to go with just two commands: cd (change the current directory) and pwd (display the current directory).\\n\\nDirectories in Vasya's operating system form a traditional hierarchical tree structure. There is a single root directory, denoted by the slash character \\\"/\\\". Every other directory has a name \u2014 a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Each directory (except for the root) has a parent directory \u2014 the one that contains the given directory. It is denoted as \\\"..\\\".\\n\\nThe command cd takes a single parameter, which is a path in the file system. The command changes the current directory to the directory specified by the path. The path consists of the names of directories separated by slashes. The name of the directory can be \\\"..\\\", which means a step up to the parent directory. \u00ab..\u00bb can be used in any place of the path, maybe several times. If the path begins with a slash, it is considered to be an absolute path, that is, the directory changes to the specified one, starting from the root. If the parameter begins with a directory name (or \\\"..\\\"), it is considered to be a relative path, that is, the directory changes to the specified directory, starting from the current one.\\n\\nThe command pwd should display the absolute path to the current directory. This path must not contain \\\"..\\\".\\n\\nInitially, the current directory is the root. All directories mentioned explicitly or passed indirectly within any command cd are considered to exist. It is guaranteed that there is no attempt of transition to the parent directory of the root directory.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line of the input data contains the single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 50) \u2014 the number of commands.\\n\\nThen follow n lines, each contains one command. Each of these lines contains either command pwd, or command cd, followed by a space-separated non-empty parameter.\\n\\nThe command parameter cd only contains lower case Latin letters, slashes and dots, two slashes cannot go consecutively, dots occur only as the name of a parent pseudo-directory. The command parameter cd does not end with a slash, except when it is the only symbol that points to the root directory. The command parameter has a length from 1 to 200 characters, inclusive.\\n\\nDirectories in the file system can have the same names.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nFor each command pwd you should print the full absolute path of the given directory, ending with a slash. It should start with a slash and contain the list of slash-separated directories in the order of being nested from the root to the current folder. It should contain no dots.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nInput\\n\\n7\\npwd\\ncd /home/vasya\\npwd\\ncd ..\\npwd\\ncd vasya/../petya\\npwd\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n/\\n/home/vasya/\\n/home/\\n/home/petya/\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n4\\ncd /a/b\\npwd\\ncd ../a/b\\npwd\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n/a/b/\\n/a/a/b/\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def pwd(cur):\\n\\tif len(cur) == 0:\\n\\t\\tprint('/')\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tprint('/' + '/'.join(cur) + '/')\\n\\ndef process(cmd, cur):\\n\\tcmd = cmd[3:]\\n\\tds = cmd.split('/')\\n\\tif cmd[0] == '/':\\n\\t\\tcur = []\\n\\tfor d in ds:\\n\\t\\tif d == '..':\\n\\t\\t\\tcur.pop()\\n\\t\\telif len(d) > 0:\\n\\t\\t\\tcur.append(d)\\n\\treturn cur\\nn = int(input())\\ncur = []\\nwhile n > 0:\\n\\tn -= 1\\n\\tcmd = input()\\n\\tif cmd == 'pwd':\\n\\t\\tpwd(cur)\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tcur = process(cmd, cur)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem simulates a simplified file system with `cd` and `pwd` commands. The key is to maintain the current directory's path as a list of directory names and correctly update it based on `cd` commands, handling both absolute and relative paths, including the `..` operator.\\n- Data Structures: Use a list to represent the path from the root directory to the current directory. Each element in the list is a directory name. An empty list represents the root directory.\\n- Algorithm for `cd`: Parse the path provided to `cd`. If the path is absolute (starts with `/`), reset the current directory list to empty. Then, split the path into directory names. Iterate through these names: if a name is `..`, remove the last element from the list (if the list is not empty). Otherwise, append the directory name to the list.\\n- Algorithm for `pwd`: If the current directory list is empty, print `/`. Otherwise, join the directory names in the list with `/` and print the result prefixed and suffixed with `/`.\\n- Edge Cases: Handle the edge case where the current directory is the root (empty list). Also, ensure that `..` operations don't remove elements from an empty directory list.\\n\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you represent the current directory path in a way that's easy to manipulate?\",\n    \"How should you handle absolute versus relative paths in the `cd` command?\",\n    \"What operations need to be performed on the directory path when encountering '..'?\",\n    \"How do you construct the full path for the `pwd` command, especially when it's at the root?\",\n    \"What data structure would be most suited to keep track of the current path given the need to easily add and remove directories?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A list of directory names is a good choice. It allows easy appending and removing of directory components.\",\n    \"If the path starts with `/`, it's absolute, so reset the current path to the root (empty list). Otherwise, it's relative, and you should modify the current path.\",\n    \"When encountering `..`, you should remove the last directory from the path, which corresponds to going up one level. Be careful not to remove from an empty path.\",\n    \"If the path is empty (root), print `/`. Otherwise, join the directories in the path with `/`, and prefix and suffix with `/`.\",\n    \"A list because the directories can be easily added to the end and removed from the end when dealing with the \\\"..\\\" command\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
