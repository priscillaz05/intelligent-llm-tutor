For each cell, count the number of adjacent cells containing 'o'. If any cell has an odd count of 'o's, the answer is 'NO'. Otherwise, the answer is 'YES'.\\n- Edge Cases: Need to handle cells on the boundary of the board carefully to avoid going out of bounds when checking adjacent cells.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you handle boundary conditions when checking adjacent cells?\",\n    \"How do you iterate through each cell of the board?\",\n    \"What constitutes an 'o' in this context?\",\n    \"How do you define adjacent cells sharing a side?\",\n    \"How do you count the adjacent cells containing character 'o' for a given cell?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"For boundary cells (e.g., cells on the edges or corners), you need to ensure that you don't try to access cells outside the board's boundaries. You can use conditional checks to avoid index out-of-bounds errors.\",\n    \"Use nested loops.
