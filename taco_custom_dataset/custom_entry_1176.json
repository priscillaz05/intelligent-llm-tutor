This is known as the minimum enclosing circle or smallest-circle problem.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: A naive approach would be to consider all possible circles defined by two or three points. The smallest circle defined by any pair of points is the circle with the diameter connecting those two points. Check if all other points are inside this circle. Then, iterate through all triplets of points, and for each triplet, find the circumcircle (the circle passing through the three points).  Check if all other points are inside the circumcircle. The minimum of all valid radii will be our answer.\\n- Optimization and Edge Cases: Consider the case where two points define the smallest circle (diameter). Need to handle potential exceptions when calculating the circumcircle (e.g., when the three points are collinear, the radius is infinite). For efficiency, one could stop early and use some optimization tricks such as iteratively improve an initial guess. Note that the number of points is limited to 50, so the complexity is not really an issue here.\\n- Implementation Details: Remember to format the output to the required precision (10^-6). Use the distance formula to determine if a point lies within a certain radius of a circle.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the definition of minimum enclosing circle and what are the key properties?\",\n    \"How can a circle be defined by two or three points in the plane, and how can we use this to find the minimum enclosing circle?\",\n    \"What is the distance formula and how is it used to determine if a point is inside a circle?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the circumcircle of three points and determine its center and radius?\",\n    \"What edge cases should be considered when implementing the algorithm, and how might these be handled?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The minimum enclosing circle (MEC) is the smallest circle that contains all given points. Key properties include that the circle must be defined by either two points (where they form a diameter) or three points (where they lie on the circumference).\",\n    \"A circle can be defined by two points as the circle with the diameter being the line segment connecting the two points.  A circle can be uniquely defined by three non-collinear points. We can iterate through pairs and triplets of points, calculate the circle they define and checking if all other points are contained within those candidate circles.\",\n    \"The distance formula is sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2). To check if a point (x, y) is inside a circle with center (cx, cy) and radius r, calculate the distance between (x, y) and (cx, cy). The point is inside the circle if this distance is less than or equal to r.\",\n    \"The circumcircle's center and radius can be found using formulas derived from the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of the triangle formed by the three points. If the points are (x1,y1), (x2,y2), and (x3,y3) then you use the formula to calculate (x, y, r) using the function in the Ground Truth Solution.\",\n    \"Edge cases include collinear points when calculating the circumcircle (which lead to division by zero, can skip these triplets), the points that create the smallest circle radius may be on the same point so must ensure i != j and i != k and j !=k. Also should handle the case where N is 2 or less to return trivially. Additionally, consider numerical stability and precision when comparing floating-point values. Remember that it only consider absolute and relative error up to 10^-6.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
