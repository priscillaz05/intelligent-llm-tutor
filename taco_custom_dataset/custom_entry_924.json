You can see that for all $v$ the conditions hold. The maximum cute set $S$ is formed by vertices $1$ and $3$. They are still connected directly by an edge, so there is a path between them.\\n\\nIn the second example, there are no edges. Since all $\\\\mathit{in}_v$ and $\\\\mathit{out}_v$ are equal to $0$, leaving a graph with zero edges is allowed. There are $5$ cute sets, each contains a single vertex. Thus, the maximum size is $1$.\\n\\nIn the third example, you can remove edges $(7, 1)$, $(2, 4)$, $(1, 3)$ and $(6, 2)$. The maximum cute set will be $S = \\\\{7, 3, 2\\\\}$. You can remove edge $(7, 3)$ as well, and the answer won't change.\\n\\nHere is the picture of the graph from the third example:\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"from collections import deque\\n(n, m) = map(int, input().split())\\ng = [[] for _ in range(n)]\\ngraph = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]\\ninv = [0] * n\\noutv = [0] * n\\nfor i in range(m):\\n\\tgraph[i][0] -= 1\\n\\tgraph[i][1] -= 1\\n\\tinv[graph[i][0]] += 1\\n\\toutv[graph[i][1]] += 1\\nS = set()\\nfor (u, v) in graph:\\n\\tif inv[u] > 1 and outv[v] > 1:\\n\\t\\tg[u].append(v)\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tS.add((u, v))\\nfor (a, b) in S:\\n\\tinv[a] -= 1\\n\\toutv[b] -= 1\\nq = deque()\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\tif outv[i] <= 0:\\n\\t\\tq.append(i)\\ndp = [0] * n\\nwhile q:\\n\\tnode = q.pop()\\n\\tfor nextNode in g[node]:\\n\\t\\tdp[nextNode] = max(dp[nextNode], dp[node] + 1)\\n\\t\\toutv[nextNode] -= 1\\n\\t\\tif outv[nextNode] == 0:\\n\\t\\t\\tq.appendleft(nextNode)\\nprint(max(dp) + 1)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Problem Decomposition: Recognize that the core task is to find the largest possible set of vertices such that after removing some edges, any two vertices in the set are reachable from one another and the indegree/outdegree constraints are satisfied. Understand that dynamic programming or a similar approach might be needed to find the maximum size of such a set.\\n- Constraint Analysis: The key constraint is the indegree/outdegree condition, which dictates which edges can be removed. This restricts the graph's structure and directly affects connectivity between vertices. Determine how to model this constraint efficiently.\\n- Edge Removal Strategy: Consider that removing edges strategically can maximize the size of the 'cute' set. Explore scenarios where edges are removed to either isolate vertices (reducing indegree/outdegree to 0) or maintain paths between specific vertices within the set.\\n- Algorithmic Design: Consider a dynamic programming approach on a DAG to find the longest path after edge removal. The 'cute' set condition translates to finding a path between any two vertices in the set. Start with vertices that have no outgoing edges and work backwards to build the set.\\n- Optimization Strategy: Employ a queue-based approach to systematically remove edges and identify vertices suitable for inclusion in the 'cute' set. Optimize the degree calculations to avoid redundant operations during edge removal.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the conditions that define a valid edge removal, and how do these conditions affect the structure of the graph?\",\n    \"What does it mean for a set of vertices to be 'cute' after edge removal, and how does this impact the algorithmic approach?\",\n    \"How can dynamic programming be applied to find the maximum size of a 'cute' set in a directed acyclic graph?\",\n    \"What is the significance of indegree and outdegree in the context of the graph and the cute set?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently manage the indegree and outdegree constraints while searching for the optimal 'cute' set?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A valid edge removal means that for each vertex, either its indegree decreases or remains 0, and similarly for the outdegree.

This implies that any two vertices in the set should be reachable from each other via the remaining edges after edge removal. It suggests that we should look for a path-like structure.\",\n    \"Dynamic programming can be used to find the longest path in the remaining graph, which can be related to the maximum 'cute' set size.

As we remove edges, we update these values. During the search for the 'cute' set, we only consider vertices and edges that still satisfy the indegree/outdegree conditions.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
