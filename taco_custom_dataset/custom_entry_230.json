The function should return the side length of this largest square.\\n- Handling Special Conditions: Consider the case where the matrix itself is surrounded by 'X' and return 'N'. Consider cases where no such submatrix exists.\\n- Choosing an Efficient Algorithm: The optimal approach is to use dynamic programming to create auxiliary matrices that store the number of consecutive 'X' characters to the left and above each cell. These matrices can then be used to determine the size of potential subsquares.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Carefully calculate the lengths of continuous 'X' characters to the left and above for each cell. Iterate through the matrix and for each cell, determine the maximum possible size of a subsquare with that cell as the bottom-right corner. Ensure to check that all borders of the subsquare are 'X' characters.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for a subsquare to be 'surrounded by X', and what characteristics must it have?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently determine the length of consecutive 'X' characters in both horizontal and vertical directions for each cell?\",\n    \"How can dynamic programming be applied to store and reuse information about consecutive 'X' characters?\",\n    \"When checking for potential subsquares, what conditions must be met to ensure it is indeed surrounded by 'X'?\",\n    \"What edge cases should be considered, and how would they affect the solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A subsquare is 'surrounded by X' if all its borders consist of 'X' characters. This means the top, bottom, left, and right sides of the subsquare must be formed by 'X' characters.\",\n    \"You can efficiently determine the length of consecutive 'X' characters by using dynamic programming. Create two auxiliary matrices: one to store the number of consecutive 'X' characters to the left of each cell, and another to store the number of consecutive 'X' characters above each cell.\",\n    \"Dynamic programming can be applied by initializing the first row and column of the auxiliary matrices based on whether the corresponding cells in the original matrix are 'X' or 'O'. Then, for each subsequent cell, if it contains 'X', its value in the auxiliary matrix is the value of the adjacent cell plus one; otherwise, it's zero.\",\n    \"To ensure a potential subsquare is surrounded by 'X', you need to check that the lengths of consecutive 'X' characters to the left and above the bottom-right cell are at least equal to the side length of the subsquare. Additionally, you must verify that the top and left borders of the subsquare are also formed by 'X' characters by checking the auxiliary matrices at the top-left corner of the submatrix.\",\n    \"Edge cases include an empty matrix (return 0), a matrix with no 'X' characters (return 0), and a matrix where the entire border consists of 'X' characters (return N).\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
