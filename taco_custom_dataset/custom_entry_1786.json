Grasp that the game ends when a player cannot make a move because there are fewer than n/2 nonempty piles.\\n- Identifying the Winning Strategy: Realize the significance of the minimum number of stones in a pile. Notice that if more than half the piles have the minimum number of stones, Bob wins because he can mirror Alice's moves on those piles. If not, Alice wins.\\n- Recognizing Key Insight: Understand the condition for Bob to win: the count of piles with the minimum number of stones must be greater than n/2. Alice loses if Bob can mirror her moves to deplete all available piles before she can.\\n- Determining Output: Based on the relationship between the number of piles with the minimum number of stones and n/2, print either \\\"Alice\\\" or \\\"Bob\\\".\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the win condition for Bob, and how does it relate to the minimum number of stones in the piles?\",\n    \"How can you determine which player wins based on the input array of stones?\",\n    \"What are the key observations that can lead to an efficient solution for this game?\",\n    \"In what scenario does Alice win this game, and how can it be determined from the problem input?\",\n    \"How would the strategy change if the number of piles a player chooses changed from n/2 to another number?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Bob wins if the count of piles containing the minimum number of stones is greater than n/2. In this scenario, Bob can mirror Alice's moves on these minimum piles and force Alice to lose.\",\n    \"First, find the minimum number of stones among all piles. Then, count how many piles have this minimum number of stones. If the count is greater than n/2, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.\",\n    \"The key observation is that the player who can always make a move on piles with the minimum number of stones has a strategic advantage. Also understanding mirroring the opponent is key.\",\n    \"Alice wins if the number of piles containing the minimum number of stones is not greater than n/2. In this case, Alice can make a strategic move that Bob cannot counter, or Bob eventually runs out of options.\",\n    \"If the number of piles a player chooses changes, the win condition would also change. The number of piles with the minimum count would have to be greater than n - the number of chosen piles to ensure Bob will win.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
