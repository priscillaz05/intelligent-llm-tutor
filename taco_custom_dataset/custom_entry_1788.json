Dijkstra's algorithm can be used as well, running it from each vertex to find shortest paths.\\n- Implementation Details: Represent the graph using an adjacency matrix. Initialize the matrix with edge weights and infinity for non-existent edges. Apply Floyd-Warshall to compute all-pairs shortest paths. Then, iterate through each edge and check if it is part of any shortest path.\\n- Identifying Non-Shortest Path Edges: For each edge (u, v) with weight c, check if the shortest path distance between u and v is equal to c. If it is not, it means there's a shorter path than going directly from u to v, so this edge is not part of any shortest path. If the shortest path distance is equal to c, then further check to see if this edge lies on *any* shortest path. To determine this, we can check if dist[u][v] == dist[u][k] + dist[k][v] for all other nodes k. If so, edge (u, v) is part of a shortest path.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you represent the graph in a way that allows efficient computation of shortest paths?\",\n    \"How does the Floyd-Warshall algorithm help in solving this problem, and what are its time and space complexities?\",\n    \"After computing all-pairs shortest paths, how do you identify the edges that are NOT part of ANY shortest path?\",\n    \"What are the constraints of N and M, and how might they impact the choice of the algorithm or data structures?\",\n    \"Are there any edge cases or specific graph structures that might require special handling?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"An adjacency matrix is suitable for this problem, allowing O(1) access to edge weights between any two vertices. Alternatively, an adjacency list can be used, but adjacency matrix is preferable for Floyd-Warshall.\",\n    \"The Floyd-Warshall algorithm computes the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices. Its time complexity is O(N^3), and space complexity is O(N^2), where N is the number of vertices.  Since N <= 100, this is acceptable. For any edge (u, v) in the graph, the final distance in the all-pairs shortest path matrix represents the shortest distance between u and v.\",\n    \"For each edge (u, v) with weight c, check if the shortest path distance from u to v (dist[u][v]) is equal to c. If dist[u][v] == c, then the edge might be on a shortest path.  If it is equal, we need to determine whether it is the *only* shortest path between the vertices.  If the shortest path is equal to dist[u][k] + dist[k][v] for any other node k, then the edge is part of another shortest path, and not the only one. Conversely, if dist[u][v] > c, it means edge (u, v) is not on any shortest path, therefore it is counted.  If dist[u][v] == c and dist[u][v] < dist[u][k] + dist[k][v] for every other node k, then it is part of a shortest path but *only* that shortest path.\",\n    \"N is between 2 and 100, and M is between N-1 and min(N(N-1)/2, 1000). These constraints suggest that an algorithm with O(N^3) time complexity (like Floyd-Warshall) is viable. The space complexity of O(N^2) is also manageable.\",\n    \"The graph is guaranteed to be connected and contain no self-loops or double edges. Thus, we don't need to check for disconnected components or handle those specific cases. However, we should still initialize the adjacency matrix with infinity values for non-existent edges.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
