For each i(0<=i<=n-1), you have to make all the elements of the array from index 0 till i equal, using minimum number of operations. In one operation you either increase or decrease the array element by 1.\\nYou have to return a list which contains the minimum number of operations for each i, to accomplish the above task.\\nNote:\\n1. 0-based indexing.\\n2. For each index, you need to consider the same array which was given to you at the start.\\nExample 1:\\nInput:\\nN=4\\nA={1,6,9,12}\\nOutput:\\n0 5 8 14\\nExplanation:\\nFor i=0, We do not need to perform any \\noperation, our array will be {1}->{1}.\\nAnd minimum number of operations\\nwill be 0.\\nFor i=1, We can choose to convert all \\nthe elements from 0<=j<=i to 4, our \\narray will become {1,6}->{4,4}. And \\nminimum number of operations will be \\n|1-4|+|6-4|=5.\\nFor i=2, We can choose to convert all \\nthe elements from 0<=j<=i to 6, our \\narray will become {1,6,9}->{6,6,6} and \\nthe minimum number of operations will \\nbe |1-6|+|6-6|+|9-6|=8.\\nSimilarly, for i=3, we can choose to \\nconvert all the elements to 8, \\n{1,6,9,12}->{8,8,8,8}, and the \\nminimum number of operations will be 14.\\nExample 2:\\nInput:\\nN=7\\nA={1,1,1,7,7,10,19}\\nOutput:\\n0 0 0 6 12 21 33\\nExplanation:\\nPossible operations could be:\\n{1}->{1}\\n{1,1}->{1,1}\\n{1,1,1}->{1,1,1}\\n{1,1,1,7}->{1,1,1,1}\\n{1,1,1,7,7}->{1,1,1,1,1}\\n{1,1,1,7,7,10}->{5,5,5,5,5,5}\\n{1,1,1,7,7,10,19}->{7,7,7,7,7,7,7}\\nYour Task:\\nYou don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function optimalArray() which takes N(length of array) and  an array A as input and returns an array of size N  with optimal answer for each index i.\\nExpected Time Complexity: O(N)\\nExpected Auxiliary Space: O(1)\\nConstraints:\\n1 <= N <= 10^{6}\\n-10^{5} <= A[i] <= 10^{5}\\nSum of N over all test case does not exceed 10^{6}.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"from typing import List\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n\\n\\tdef optimalArray(self, n: int, a: List[int]) -> List[int]:\\n\\t\\tres = [0 for _ in range(n)]\\n\\t\\tind = 1\\n\\t\\tfor i in range(1, n):\\n\\t\\t\\tres[ind] = res[i - 1] + (a[i] - a[i // 2])\\n\\t\\t\\tind += 1\\n\\t\\treturn res\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The core task is to calculate the minimum operations needed to make all elements from index 0 to i equal, for each i in the input array.\\n- Identifying the Optimal Value: Recognize that the optimal value to convert all elements to is the median of the sub-array from 0 to i. For each index i, calculate the median and the sum of absolute differences from the median.\\n- Calculating Minimum Operations Incrementally: Given that the array is already sorted, leverage the previous result to compute the current result. The previous result represents the minimum cost for the sub-array up to index i-1.  We can efficiently compute the median and operation counts by understanding how the median shifts when we include a new element.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: For the first element (i=0), no operations are needed. Note that the length of input array `n` can be 1, in which case the algorithm should directly return [0].\\n- Complexity Analysis: The approach should aim for O(N) time complexity, achieved by calculating the result incrementally and efficiently finding medians.  Also, the solution should aim for O(1) auxiliary space.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you determine the optimal value to which all elements should be converted to minimize the total number of operations?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently calculate the median of a sorted sub-array from index 0 to i for each i?\",\n    \"How can you leverage the sorted nature of the array to reduce computational complexity while determining the number of operations?\",\n    \"Given the previous result (minimum operations for index i-1), how can you use it to calculate the result for the current index i efficiently?\",\n    \"Are there any edge cases that need special handling, such as when the input array contains only one element?\",\n    \"What would be the complexity analysis of the optimal solution in terms of time and space?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The optimal value is the median of the sub-array from index 0 to i. Converting all elements to the median minimizes the sum of absolute differences, which corresponds to the number of operations.\",\n    \"Since the sub-array is sorted, the median can be found directly. For an odd number of elements, it's the middle element. For an even number of elements, it's either of the two middle elements (either would yield the same number of operations, and the problem doesn't specify how to choose).\",\n    \"Because the array is sorted, we can calculate operations incrementally. No need to re-sort or re-calculate everything from scratch for each index i.\",\n    \"The key insight is to observe the median change. The provided ground truth exploits this, using the element at i//2 (the \\\"median\\\") to calculate a cost difference with the new element at `i`. By adding this difference to the previous result, the minimum operation count is calculated efficiently.\",\n    \"Yes, if the input array is of length 1, the result should be [0].\",\n    \"The optimal solution has a time complexity of O(N) because we iterate through the array once. The auxiliary space complexity is O(1) because we're using a fixed amount of extra space.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
