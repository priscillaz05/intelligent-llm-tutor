The goal is to find the smallest possible sum.\\n- Identifying Key Insight: The crucial insight is that repeatedly applying the GCD operation will eventually make all elements equal to the GCD of the original array elements. To minimize the sum, you want to make all array elements equal to the greatest common divisor of the entire array, and the minimum sum is then simply N * GCD.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: Calculate the GCD of all the elements in the array. Multiply the GCD by the number of elements N to obtain the minimum possible sum.\\n- Edge Cases: Consider edge cases such as when the array has only two elements or when all elements are already equal.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the significance of the GCD operation in minimizing the array sum?\",\n    \"How does repeatedly applying the GCD operation affect the elements of the array?\",\n    \"What is the final state of the array that results in the minimum possible sum?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the GCD of multiple numbers efficiently?\",\n    \"What are some edge cases to consider, and how do they affect the solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The GCD operation helps to reduce the values of the elements, bringing them closer to a common divisor. This is essential for minimizing the overall sum of the array.\",\n    \"Repeatedly applying the GCD operation between pairs of elements will eventually lead to all elements being equal to the GCD of all original elements.\",\n    \"The final state of the array that gives the minimum sum is when all elements are equal to the GCD of the original array elements.\",\n    \"You can iteratively calculate the GCD. Start with the GCD of the first two numbers, then find the GCD of that result with the third number, and so on until you have processed all numbers in the array.\",\n    \"Edge cases include arrays with only two elements or arrays where all elements are already equal. In the first case, calculate GCD of the two numbers and multiply by 2. In the second case, the initial sum is already the minimum, so the answer will be n * array[0]\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
