"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"A carpet shop sells carpets in different varieties. Each carpet can come in a different roll width and can have a different price per square meter. \\n\\nWrite a function `cost_of_carpet` which calculates the cost (rounded to 2 decimal places) of carpeting a room, following these constraints:\\n\\n* The carpeting has to be done in one unique piece. If not possible, retrun `\\\"error\\\"`.\\n* The shop sells any length of a roll of carpets, but always with a full width.\\n* The cost has to be minimal.\\n* The length of the room passed as argument can sometimes be shorter than its width (because we define these relatively to the position of the door in the room).\\n* A length or width equal to zero is considered invalid, return `\\\"error\\\"` if it occurs.\\n\\n\\nINPUTS:\\n\\n`room_width`, `room_length`, `roll_width`, `roll_cost` as floats.\\n\\nOUTPUT:\\n\\n`\\\"error\\\"` or the minimal cost of the room carpeting, rounded to two decimal places.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def cost_of_carpet(room_length, room_width, roll_width, roll_cost):\\n\\t(x, y) = sorted((room_length, room_width))\\n\\tif y == 0 or x > roll_width:\\n\\t\\treturn 'error'\\n\\tif y < roll_width:\\n\\t\\treturn round(x * roll_width * roll_cost, 2)\\n\\treturn round(y * roll_width * roll_cost, 2)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding Problem Constraints: Identify that the carpet has to be one unique piece, roll width has to be respected, cost has to be minimal, room length can be shorter than the width and that length and width equal to zero is invalid.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: The room dimensions could be given in any order (length can be bigger than width), a dimension can be zero (invalid input), and the roll width could be insufficient to cover the room.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Sort the room dimensions to easily determine which dimension should be considered the \\\"length\\\" and which the \\\"width\\\". Check if any dimension is zero or if the smaller dimension of the room is bigger than the width of the roll, then return 'error'. Return the cost of the area to be covered (always using the biggest dimension of the room as a length to cover) times the roll cost, rounded to two decimal places.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean that the carpeting has to be done in one unique piece, and how does this constrain the solution?\",\n    \"How should the function handle the cases where the room dimensions (length and width) are provided in different orders, i.e., length > width or vice versa?\",\n    \"How can the code ensure that the chosen carpet roll width minimizes the cost, considering the constraints of the problem?\",\n    \"What specific conditions would lead to the function returning the string 'error', and how are these conditions checked in the code?\",\n    \"Given the requirement to round the final cost to two decimal places, which Python function would be most suitable, and how should it be used?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"It means that we have to use only one single piece of carpet. If it's not possible because the room is wider than the carpet roll, then an error should be returned.\",\n    \"The code should sort the room dimensions, assigning the shorter dimension to one variable and the longer to another, ensuring consistent handling regardless of the input order.\",\n    \"The carpet always has to be the size of the width of the roll. Since we can always buy the necessary carpet length, we will consider the longest dimension of the room to define the length to buy. We cannot buy only some parts of the width, so the cost is always defined by the roll width.\",\n    \"The function should return 'error' if either the length or width of the room is zero, or if the smaller dimension of the room is larger than the roll width. This implies that the carpet roll is not wide enough to cover the room.\",\n    \"The `round()` function should be used to round the final cost to two decimal places. It should be used like this: `round(cost, 2)`, where `cost` is the calculated cost.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
