As Christmas is approaching, JOI decided to decorate the walls of the building with illuminations. However, since it is useless to illuminate the parts that cannot be seen from the outside, we decided to decorate only the walls that can be reached from the outside without passing through the building.\\n\\nGiven a map showing the layout of JOI's buildings, create a program to find the total length of the walls to decorate. However, the outside of the map can be freely moved, and it is not possible to pass between adjacent buildings.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nTwo integers W and H (1 \u2264 W \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 H \u2264 100) are written on the first line of the input file, separated by blanks. The following line H describes the layout of the JOI building. On the first line of i + (1 \u2264 i \u2264 H), W integers are written separated by blanks, and the jth (1 \u2264 j \u2264 W) integer is a regular hexagon with coordinates (j, i). It is 1 when there is a building in, and 0 when there is no building. Also, the input data given always has one or more buildings.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nOutput the total length of the walls to be decorated with illuminations in one line.\\n\\nInput example 1\\n\\n8 4\\n0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1\\n0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0\\n1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1\\n0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0\\n\\nOutput example 1\\n\\n64\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import sys\\nsys.setrecursionlimit(100000)\\n(W, H) = map(int, input().split())\\nm = [list(map(int, input().split())) for i in range(H)]\\ndx = [[1, 1, 1, 0, -1, 0], [0, 1, 0, -1, -1, -1]]\\ndy = [-1, 0, 1, 1, 0, -1]\\n\\ndef dfs(x, y):\\n\\tif m[y][x] != 0:\\n\\t\\treturn\\n\\tm[y][x] = 2\\n\\tfor (xx, yy) in zip(dx[y % 2], dy):\\n\\t\\t(tx, ty) = (x + xx, y + yy)\\n\\t\\tif 0 <= tx < W and 0 <= ty < H:\\n\\t\\t\\tdfs(tx, ty)\\nfor x in range(W):\\n\\tdfs(x, 0)\\n\\tdfs(x, H - 1)\\nfor y in range(H):\\n\\tdfs(0, y)\\n\\tdfs(W - 1, y)\\nfrom itertools import product\\nn = 0\\nfor (x, y) in product(range(W), range(H)):\\n\\tif m[y][x] != 1:\\n\\t\\tcontinue\\n\\tfn = n\\n\\tfor (xx, yy) in zip(dx[y % 2], dy):\\n\\t\\t(tx, ty) = (x + xx, y + yy)\\n\\t\\tif 0 <= tx < W and 0 <= ty < H:\\n\\t\\t\\tif m[ty][tx] == 2:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tn += 1\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tn += 1\\nprint(n)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem asks to calculate the total length of walls of buildings that are exposed to the outside. The input is a grid representing the layout of buildings, where 1 represents a building and 0 represents an empty space.\\n- Identifying the Algorithm: The solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) to mark all the empty spaces connected to the outside as '2'. Then, it iterates through the grid and, for each building (marked as '1'), it checks its adjacent cells. If an adjacent cell is marked as '2' (meaning it's connected to the outside) or is outside the grid boundaries, it means that side of the building is exposed and contributes to the total wall length.\\n- Implementing the Solution: The DFS function explores all empty spaces connected to the boundaries. The main part of the code iterates through each building, checking its six adjacent sides. It counts the number of exposed sides, which directly corresponds to the total wall length to be decorated.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does the DFS algorithm help determine which walls are exposed to the outside?\",\n    \"How are the coordinates of the adjacent cells determined, considering the hexagonal grid?\",\n    \"Why is it important to handle out-of-bounds conditions when checking adjacent cells?\",\n    \"What is the significance of marking reachable empty cells with '2' during the DFS traversal?\",\n    \"How does the code account for the fact that the grid uses hexagonal cells and not square cells?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The DFS algorithm identifies all empty spaces connected to the outside boundaries of the grid. By marking these spaces, the algorithm makes it easy to check if a building's wall is adjacent to the outside.\",\n    \"The dx and dy arrays store the relative coordinates of the six adjacent cells in the hexagonal grid.  The even/odd row index is used to determine the offset of adjacent cells since hexagons are staggered.\",\n    \"Handling out-of-bounds conditions ensures that the program doesn't try to access memory outside the grid boundaries, which would cause an error. It also accounts for the fact that buildings on the edge of the grid will have walls exposed to the 'outside'.\",\n    \"Marking reachable empty cells with '2' allows the code to quickly identify whether a wall is exposed to the outside without having to re-explore the grid or use more complex logic.\",\n    \"The code uses the `dx` and `dy` lists, and specifically the `dx[y % 2]` component to adjust the x coordinate traversal pattern based on whether the current row `y` is even or odd. This is necessary because of the hexagonal grid structure, which causes the relative positions of neighboring hexagons to vary by row.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
