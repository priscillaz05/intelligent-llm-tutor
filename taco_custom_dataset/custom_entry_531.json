He finds the following similar problem interesting in particular: there are N random variables, the i-th of which can take any integer value from some segment [Li;Ri] (all numbers from this segment are equiprobable). It means that the value of the i-th quantity can be equal to any integer number from a given interval [Li;Ri] with probability 1 / (Ri - Li + 1).\\n\\nThe Hedgehog wants to know the probability of the event that the first digits of at least K% of those values will be equal to one. In other words, let us consider some set of fixed values of these random variables and leave only the first digit (the MSD \u2014 most significant digit) of each value. Then let's count how many times the digit 1 is encountered and if it is encountered in at least K per cent of those N values, than such set of values will be called a good one. You have to find the probability that a set of values of the given random variables will be a good one.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line contains number N which is the number of random variables (1 \u2264 N \u2264 1000). Then follow N lines containing pairs of numbers Li, Ri, each of whom is a description of a random variable. It is guaranteed that 1 \u2264 Li \u2264 Ri \u2264 1018.\\n\\nThe last line contains an integer K (0 \u2264 K \u2264 100).\\n\\nAll the numbers in the input file are integers.\\n\\nPlease, do not use %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++.

The goal is to calculate the probability that at least K% of N random variables, each drawn from a range [Li, Ri], have a leading digit of 1.\\n- Identifying Key Calculations: For each variable, calculate the probability that its leading digit is 1. This involves counting how many numbers within the range [Li, Ri] have a leading digit of 1, and then dividing by the total numbers within the range (Ri - Li + 1).\\n- Applying Dynamic Programming: Use dynamic programming to calculate the overall probability. The DP state can be defined as dp[i][j], representing the probability that among the first 'i' variables, at least 'j' of them have a leading digit of 1.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Consider the cases where K is 0 or 100 and how they influence the lower bound calculation of number of ones required i.e. atLeast. Consider cases where L and R are equal to zero. Handle floating point precisions during the probability calculation.\\n- Optimization and Implementation: Optimize the code for 64-bit integers. Ensure the output is printed with the required precision to avoid errors.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can the number of integers with a leading digit of 1 within a given range [L, R] be efficiently calculated, considering the range can be very large (up to 10^18)?\",\n    \"How can the atLeast variable (minimum number of ones needed) be correctly calculated, considering integer division and edge cases such as when k is 0 or 100?\",\n    \"How can dynamic programming be used to compute the overall probability, and what should the base cases and transition function be?\",\n    \"What are some potential pitfalls or considerations when working with large integers and floating-point numbers in this problem, and how can they be addressed?\",\n    \"What are the base cases for the DP solution and how are probabilities combined across different random variables?\",\n    \"Given the potential for very small probabilities, how can we guarantee that the output meets the required precision (relative or absolute error of at most 10^-9)?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The number of integers starting with 1 in [L, R] can be found by calculating the number of integers starting with 1 up to R, and subtracting the number of integers starting with 1 up to L - 1.
