The pattern is made of unit digits. If n is less than 1, an empty string must be returned.\\n- Deconstruct the pattern: Each row reduces by 1 until it reaches 1 or 0, then depending on n value the sequence may continue reducing to negative values which are then converted to unit digits, and the digits are replicated to fill the row until it is length n.\\n- Devise an algorithm: Create a nested loop or comprehension. The outer loop will be to make a list of n rows. The inner loop will calculate the value for each character in the rows. The innermost will generate a number from 0 to n and the outer will iterate through each row. The value of each cell is `(n - min(j, i)) % 10`.\\n- Construct the string: Join each row using an empty string, then join all the rows using newline character.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What should the function return if the input integer n is less than 1?\",\n    \"How do you generate the sequence of decreasing numbers in each row, and what happens when the numbers become negative?\",\n    \"How do you ensure that each line in the output pattern has the same length (n)?\",\n    \"How are the row values dependent on both the row number and the column number?\",\n    \"What does the use of modulo 10 achieve?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"If n is less than 1, the function should return an empty string.\",\n    \"The sequence of decreasing numbers is generated using the formula (n - min(j, i)), and when numbers become negative they are handled using modulo 10.\",\n    \"Each line has length n because the inner loop iterates exactly n times, generating n digits for each row.\",\n    \"The value at each cell is determined by the minimum value between the current row index (i) and the column index (j).
