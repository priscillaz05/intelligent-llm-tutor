This involves iteratively calculating each number based on the previous 'k' numbers.\\n- Decomposing 's' into K-bonacci Numbers: Starting from the largest K-bonacci number less than or equal to 's', greedily subtract K-bonacci numbers from 's' until 's' becomes 0. Keep track of the K-bonacci numbers used in this decomposition.\\n- Ensuring At Least Two Numbers: Verify that the decomposition consists of at least two distinct K-bonacci numbers.
