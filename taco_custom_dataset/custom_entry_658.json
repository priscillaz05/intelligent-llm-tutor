Realize that each subarray's elements are then replaced by the maximum value within that subarray. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after this partitioning and value replacement.\\n- Identifying Optimization Strategy: Recognize the need to find an optimal partitioning strategy to maximize the sum. Consider the role of dynamic programming in caching previous computations to avoid redundant calculations.\\n- Developing a Dynamic Programming Approach: Design a dynamic programming approach where `dp[i]` represents the maximum sum achievable for the first `i` elements of the array. Formulate a recursive relation to compute `dp[i]` by considering all possible subarray lengths ending at index `i`.\\n- Optimizing Iteration: Plan for iterating through the array and, for each index, consider subarrays ending at that index, up to length `k`. Optimize the iteration by calculating the maximum value within each subarray and using it to compute the potential sum.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can we determine the maximum sum achievable for the first 'i' elements of the array after partitioning?\",\n    \"What strategies can be used to efficiently calculate the maximum value within each subarray?\",\n    \"How would you define a recursive relationship or dynamic programming equation to solve this problem?\",\n    \"How does the constraint 'k' affect the possible strategies for partitioning the array?\",\n    \"What are the base cases that can be used to initialise dynamic programming table?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"We can determine the maximum sum by considering all possible subarray endings at index 'i' and choosing the one that yields the maximum overall sum.\",\n    \"We can iterate through each subarray, tracking the maximum value encountered so far.
