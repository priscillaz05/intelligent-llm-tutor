In each turn, every element Ai is replaced by MAX - Ai, where MAX is the maximum value in A before that turn.\\n- Identifying Key Operations: Recognize the need to find the maximum element in the array in each turn. Understand the transformation Ai = MAX - Ai that needs to be applied to each element.\\n- Optimizing for Large K: Realize that the array transformation will reach a stable state after a few turns due to the properties of max and min. Therefore, simulating all K turns is unnecessary, especially considering K can be large (up to 10^9).\\n- Finding the Pattern: Simulate a few turns (e.g., 2 or 3 turns) to observe the array's transformation. Notice the relationship between max, min, and the transformed values. After two turns, the array elements become A[i] - min(A). This significantly reduces computation.\\n- Implementing Efficient Calculation: Use the parity of K to determine whether to perform one transformation or two. If K is even, the array elements will be A[i] - min(A). If K is odd, the array elements will be max(A) - A[i] after the first transformation.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you determine the maximum value in the array for each turn, and how does this affect the transformation of the array elements?\",\n    \"What is the relevance of the parity of K (whether K is even or odd), and how does it affect the outcome of the transformations?\",\n    \"How can you optimize the solution to avoid simulating all K turns, especially when K is very large?\",\n    \"What happens to the array after two turns, and can you generalize this pattern to simplify the computation?\",\n    \"What are the possible edge cases or constraints that you should consider to ensure the correctness of the solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The maximum value in the array is determined by iterating through all elements and finding the largest. The transformation Ai = MAX - Ai modifies each element relative to this maximum value.\",\n    \"The parity of K is important because it determines whether one or two transformations need to be considered. If K is odd, one transformation (MAX - A[i]) is needed. If K is even, two transformations (A[i] - min(A)) are needed.\",\n    \"To optimize, you can observe that the array converges to a state after at most two transformations. There's no need to simulate all K turns; just determine whether to perform one or two transformations based on K's parity.\",\n    \"After two turns, the array's elements will be A[i] - min(A). The transformation process involves A[i] becoming MAX - A[i] after the first turn, then becoming MAX' - (MAX - A[i]) = A[i] + MAX' - MAX after the second turn, where MAX' is the new max. Because max - (max -A[i]) = A[i], and after one transformation, the smallest value in the array is going to be 0, you get that all the elements after 2 turns will be A[i] - min(A) where min(A) is the minimum value that the array had after the first turn which is always going to be zero.\",\n    \"Edge cases include when N is 0 or 1, or when K is 0. When K is 0, the array remains unchanged. The constraints ensure the calculations do not result in integer overflows.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
