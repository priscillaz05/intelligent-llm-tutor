Understand the definitions of leaf, depth, and lowest common ancestor.\\n- Identifying Edge Cases and Base Cases: Consider the base case when the root is None, and the scenario when the tree has only one node. Account for cases where the deepest leaves are only on one side of the tree.\\n- Selecting a Recursive Approach: Think about how recursion can effectively traverse the tree to find the depth of each node and identify the deepest leaves. Consider how to pass depth information during the recursive calls.\\n- Implementing Depth Calculation: Implement a method that determines the depth of a given node and how to use this to keep track of the maximum depth encountered so far.\\n- Combining Depth and LCA Finding: Devise a strategy to combine the depth calculation with the LCA determination within a single traversal. Make sure the function returns both the LCA node and the depth of the subtree.\\n- Handling Unequal Subtree Depths: Determine how to return the correct LCA when the depths of the left and right subtrees differ.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you define the depth of a node and how does this definition affect your approach to solving the problem?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: The depth of the root node is 0, and the depth of its children is one more than its depth.
