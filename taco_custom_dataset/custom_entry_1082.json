The rules are as follows:\\n\\nInitially, Nikita has an array of integers.\\n\\nIn each move, Nikita must partition the array into $2$ non-empty contiguous parts such that the sum of the elements in the left partition is equal to the sum of the elements in the right partition. If Nikita can make such a move, she gets $1$ point; otherwise, the game ends.\\n\\nAfter each successful move, Nikita discards either the left partition or the right partition and continues playing by using the remaining partition as array $\\\\textbf{arr}$.\\n\\nNikita loves this game and wants your help getting the best score possible. Given $\\\\textbf{arr}$, can you find and print the maximum number of points she can score?\\n\\nFor example, Nikita starts with the array $arr=[1,2,3,6]$.  She first splits it into $a1=[1,2,3]$ and $a2=[6]$, then discards $a2$.  $arr=a1\\\\rightarrow a1=[1,2],a2=[3]$.  Discard $a2$ leaving $arr=[1,2]$.  This cannot be further split, so Nikita scored $2$.   \\n\\nFunction Description  \\n\\nComplete the arraySplitting function in the editor below.  It should return an integer that reperesents the number of times Nikita can split the array.  \\n\\narraySplitting has the following parameter(s):  \\n\\narr: an array of integers  \\n\\nInput Format\\n\\nThe first line contains an integer $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\boldsymbol{t}}$, the number of test cases. \\n\\nEach of the next $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\boldsymbol{t}}$ pairs of lines is as follows:  \\n\\nThe first line contains an integer $n$, the size of array $\\\\textbf{arr}$.\\nThe next line contains $n$ space-separated integers $arr\\\\left[i\\\\right]$.  \\n\\nConstraints\\n\\n$1\\\\leq t\\\\leq10$\\n$1\\\\leq n\\\\leq2^{14}$\\n$0\\\\leq ar r[i]\\\\leq10^9$\\n\\nScoring     \\n\\n$1\\\\leq n\\\\leq2^8$ for $30\\\\%$ of the test data\\n$1\\\\leq n\\\\leq2^{11}$ for $\\\\textbf{60\\\\%}$ of the test data\\n$1\\\\leq n\\\\leq2^{14}$ for $\\\\textbf{100\\\\%}$ of the test data\\n\\nOutput Format\\n\\nFor each test case, print Nikita's maximum possible score on a new line.\\n\\nSample Input\\n3\\n3\\n3 3 3\\n4\\n2 2 2 2\\n7\\n4 1 0 1 1 0 1\\n\\nSample Output\\n0\\n2\\n3\\n\\nExplanation\\n\\nTest Case 0:  \\n\\nNikita cannot partition $\\\\mbox{A}$ into $2$ parts having equal sums. Therefore, her maximum possible score is $0$ and we print $0$ on a new line.\\n\\nTest Case 1:  \\n\\nInitially, $\\\\mbox{A}$ looks like this: \\n\\nShe splits the array into $2$ partitions having equal sums, and then discards the left partition:   \\n\\nShe then splits the new array into $2$ partitions having equal sums, and then discards the left partition:      \\n\\nAt this point the array only has $1$ element and can no longer be partitioned, so the game ends. Because Nikita successfully split the array twice, she gets $2$ points and we print $2$ on a new line.\\n\\nTest Case 2:\\n\\narray\\t\\ta1\\ta2\\n[4,1,0,1,1,0,1]\\t[4]\\t[1,0,1,1,0,1]\\n[1,0,1,1,0,1]\\t[1,0,1]\\t[1,0,1]\\n[1,0,1]\\t\\t[1,0]\\t[1]\\n\\nThe answer is $3$.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import math\\n\\ndef solve(a):\\n\\ts = sum(a)\\n\\tif s % 2:\\n\\t\\treturn 0\\n\\ts //= 2\\n\\tt = 0\\n\\tfor i in range(len(a)):\\n\\t\\tt += a[i]\\n\\t\\tif t == s:\\n\\t\\t\\treturn 1 + max(solve(a[:i + 1]), solve(a[i + 1:]))\\n\\t\\tif t > s:\\n\\t\\t\\treturn 0\\n\\ndef solve0(n):\\n\\treturn n - 1\\nt = int(input().strip())\\nfor test in range(t):\\n\\tn = int(input().strip())\\n\\ta = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))\\n\\tif sum(a) == 0:\\n\\t\\tprint(solve0(n))\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tprint(solve(a))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Game Rules: Clearly define the rules of the game, including the conditions for a valid split (equal sums of partitions) and how the game progresses (discarding a partition and continuing). Identify the scoring mechanism (1 point per successful split). Also understand that the game ends when a valid split isn't possible\\n- Identifying Base Cases: Recognize that the game ends (score remains unchanged) if the initial array or any subsequent partition cannot be split into two parts with equal sums. A special case is when the sum of the array is odd; in that case the score is 0.\\n- Algorithmic Approach: A recursive approach seems appropriate. The function should attempt to find a valid split. If one is found, the function recursively calls itself on both the left and right partitions. The score returned is 1 (for the current split) plus the maximum of the scores obtained from the recursive calls.\\n- Handling the Sum is Zero Edge Case: The example shows a solve0 function to deal with the edge case where the sum of all elements is 0.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the condition for a valid split in the array, and how does this condition impact the scoring?\",\n    \"What are the base cases for the recursive algorithm, and when should the recursion stop?\",\n    \"If the sum of all elements in the initial array or any sub-array is odd, what is the maximum possible score?\",\n    \"If a valid split is found, what needs to be done to update the score and how can we explore all possible split combinations to maximize the score?\",\n    \"How do you account for the case when all numbers in the array are 0?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A valid split requires dividing the array into two non-empty contiguous parts such that the sum of elements in the left partition equals the sum of elements in the right partition. If a valid split cannot be found, the score is 0.\",\n    \"The recursion should stop when either the array is empty or when a valid split cannot be found (i.e., no partition exists that satisfies the equal-sum condition).\",\n    \"If the sum of all elements in the array is odd, it is impossible to split the array into two partitions with equal sums. Therefore, the maximum possible score is 0.\",\n    \"If a valid split is found, the score is incremented by 1. Then, the function should recursively call itself on both the left and right partitions to explore further possible splits. The maximum score between the left and right partitions is then chosen.\",\n    \"When all numbers in array are zero the answer will be n-1, as we will always be able to split it into 2 parts of equal sum (both are zero).\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
