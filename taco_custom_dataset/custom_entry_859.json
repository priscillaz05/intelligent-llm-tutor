Specifically, the regex should check the presence of optional '+/-' signs, digits before the decimal, a single decimal point, and at least one digit after the decimal point.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: The regex must correctly handle cases with and without leading '+' or '-' signs, and it should validate that there is at least one digit after the decimal point.
