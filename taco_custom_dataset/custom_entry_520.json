So, the maximum possible value of $K$ is $3$. It can be shown that we cannot sort the permutation for any $K> 3$.\\n\\n- Test Case $2$: Swapping $P_{2}$ and $P_{4}$ will sort the permutation. So, the maximum possible value of $K$ is $2$. It can be shown that we cannot sort the permutation for any $K> 2$.\\n\\n- Test Case $3$: Swapping $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ will sort the permutation.

The maximum possible K will be related to the distances an element has to travel to its correct position.\\n- Formulating an Algorithm: Calculate the absolute difference between each element's value and its index. Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all these absolute differences. This GCD will be the maximum possible K.\\n- Implementation Details: Read the input, calculate the absolute differences, compute the GCD, and print the result.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the relationship between the value K and the ability to sort the permutation?\",\n    \"How can you determine if a given K is a valid value for sorting the permutation?\",\n    \"Can you formulate a mathematical property that K must satisfy to guarantee the permutation can be sorted?\",\n    \"How does the distance an element has to travel relate to the value of K?\",\n    \"Why is the greatest common divisor relevant to finding the maximum value of K?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"K is the distance between elements that can be swapped. If an element needs to move a distance that is a multiple of K, then it can be sorted.\",\n    \"A K is valid if for every element, the absolute difference between its current index and its correct index is a multiple of K.\",\n    \"K must be a divisor of the absolute difference between the value of each element and its index for the permutation to be sortable.\",\n    \"The distance an element has to travel to its correct position must be a multiple of K.\",\n    \"The greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the distances an element has to travel gives the largest possible K because it ensures that K divides all the required movement distances.
