Repeatedly move the piece to the square where the integer x+D is written, as long as x is not R_i.

The magic points are determined by the Manhattan distance between the squares where the piece moves.\\n- Data Structure Considerations: A crucial step is efficiently mapping each number from 1 to H*W to its corresponding (row, column) coordinates in the grid. Utilizing a lookup table to avoid repeatedly searching the grid will be important for performance.\\n- Algorithmic Approach: Precompute the cumulative cost of moving from i to i+D for all valid i.  Then for each query, the total cost can be calculated as the difference between the precomputed costs for the final and initial positions. This precomputation will significantly reduce the time complexity for each query.\\n- Edge Case Handling: Ensure that L_i and R_i are within the grid's number range [1, H*W]. Also, since R_i-L_i is guaranteed to be a multiple of D, boundary checks within the main loop aren't necessary, simplifying the process.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you efficiently map the integer values in the grid to their respective coordinates to avoid redundant searches?\",\n    \"Can you explain the advantage of precomputing cumulative magic costs and how it affects the time complexity of handling multiple queries?\",\n    \"What data structures are most suitable for storing and accessing the precomputed costs for efficient calculation?\",\n    \"Given the constraints, how can you optimize memory usage while ensuring the code remains efficient?\",\n    \"How does the guarantee that (R_i - L_i) is a multiple of D simplify the main calculation loop, and what potential optimizations does this allow?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"You can create a lookup table (e.g., a dictionary or an array indexed by the integer values) where the keys are the integer values from 1 to H*W, and the values are the corresponding (row, column) coordinates. This allows O(1) access to the coordinates given an integer value.\",\n    \"Precomputing cumulative magic costs means calculating and storing the total cost to reach a certain value starting from D. For each query, you can then calculate the total cost between L_i and R_i by subtracting the precomputed cost at L_i from the precomputed cost at R_i, resulting in O(1) complexity per query after the initial precomputation. Without precomputation, each query would require iterating through the grid, leading to higher time complexity overall.\",\n    \"An array is ideal for storing precomputed costs, where the index corresponds to the integer value in the grid and the value at that index represents the cumulative magic cost. This provides O(1) access for calculating differences between R_i and L_i.\",\n    \"Given that the constraints limit H and W to 300, and D to H*W, you can optimize memory by using integer arrays to store grid values and precomputed costs. Use data types that efficiently store these integers without excessive memory overhead.\",\n    \"The guarantee that (R_i - L_i) is a multiple of D ensures that you don't need to check for boundary conditions or invalid moves within the teleportation loop. This knowledge can simplify the code and potentially reduce unnecessary conditional checks, optimizing performance. It also implies that you can focus on directly calculating the difference in precomputed costs without handling intermediate cases where R_i - L_i is not a multiple of D.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
