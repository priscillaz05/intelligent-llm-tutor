Fig. 1 illustrates an example of a graph (or graphs).\\n\\n<image>\\nFig. 1\\n\\nA free tree is a connnected, acyclic, undirected graph. A rooted tree is a free tree in which one of the vertices is distinguished from the others. A vertex of a rooted tree is called \\\"node.\\\"\\n\\nYour task is to write a program which reports the following information for each node u of a given rooted tree T:\\n\\n* node ID of u\\n* parent of u\\n* depth of u\\n* node type (root, internal node or leaf)\\n* a list of chidlren of u\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the last edge on the path from the root r of a tree T to a node x is (p, x), then p is the parent of x, and x is a child of p. The root is the only node in T with no parent.\\n\\nA node with no children is an external node or leaf. A nonleaf node is an internal node\\n\\nThe number of children of a node x in a rooted tree T is called the degree of x.\\n\\nThe length of the path from the root r to a node x is the depth of x in T.\\n\\nHere, the given tree consists of n nodes and evey node has a unique ID from 0 to n-1.\\n\\nFig. 2 shows an example of rooted trees where ID of each node is indicated by a number in a circle (node).

This representation allows efficient traversal and retrieval of node relationships.\\n- Input Parsing: The input consists of the number of nodes followed by node descriptions including the node ID, the number of children, and the IDs of the children. The input needs to be parsed to build the tree data structure.\\n- Depth Calculation: The depth of each node needs to be calculated. The depth is the number of edges from the root to the node. This can be done using a recursive approach.\\n- Identifying Node Type: Determine the node type (root, internal node, or leaf) based on whether it has a parent (root) and whether it has children (internal node or leaf).\\n- Output Formatting: Generate the output in the specific format required by the problem, including node ID, parent ID, depth, node type, and list of children.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you represent the tree data structure in memory using the left-child, right-sibling representation?\",\n    \"How would you parse the input to construct the tree based on the given format?\",\n    \"How would you calculate the depth of each node in the tree?\",\n    \"How would you determine the type of each node (root, internal node, or leaf)?\",\n    \"How would you construct the list of children for each node?\",\n    \"How do you handle the edge case when the tree is empty?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A list of nodes can be used, where each node stores the parent ID, the ID of the leftmost child, and the ID of the immediate right sibling. A value of -1 or None can indicate the absence of a parent or sibling.\",\n    \"Read the input line by line. For each node, extract the ID, number of children, and the IDs of the children. Update the parent, leftmost child, and right sibling information in the tree data structure.\",\n    \"Use a recursive function that takes the node ID as input. If the node is the root (no parent), its depth is 0. Otherwise, its depth is 1 plus the depth of its parent. Use memoization (e.g., the `depths` array in the solution) to avoid redundant calculations.\",\n    \"A node is a root if it has no parent. A node is a leaf if it has no children. A node is an internal node if it is not a root and has children.\",\n    \"Starting from the leftmost child of a node, traverse the right siblings until there are no more siblings. Store the IDs of these siblings in a list. If a node has no leftmost child, the list is empty.\",\n    \"If the input specifies that there are 0 nodes then you need to output nothing\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
