The objective is to find and return all such numbers `i` in the range 0 to N inclusive.\\n- Identifying the Correct Range and Condition: Iterate from 0 to N (inclusive) and apply the bitwise AND condition.  If N & i == i, then 'i' is a bitwise subset of N.\\n- Data Structures: Use a list to store the bitwise subsets.\\n- Order of results: The result list needs to be reversed before returning.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is a bitwise subset, and how is it determined?\",\n    \"What range of numbers should be checked to determine if they are bitwise subsets of N?\",\n    \"How should the results be ordered in the returned list?\",\n    \"What is the bitwise AND operator, and how does it apply to this problem?\",\n    \"What data structure would be appropriate to store the bitwise subsets?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A bitwise subset 'i' of 'N' is a number such that the bitwise AND of 'N' and 'i' equals 'i'.
