This time the organizers of one unusual programming competition have decided to please the winner even more and to add a nameplate to the cup with the handle of the winner.\\n\\nThe nameplate is to be rectangular and the text on it will be printed as a table of several rows and columns. Having some measurements done, the organizers have found out that the number a of rows cannot be greater than 5 while the number b of columns cannot exceed 20. Every cell of the table will contain either an asterisk (\u00ab*\u00bb) or a letter of user's handle.\\n\\nFurthermore, the organizers want the rows of the table to be uniform, which means that the number of asterisks used in different rows should differ by at most one (i.e. you can't have two asterisks in the first row and none in the second). The main goal, however, is to obtain the winner's handle precisely when reading the table from top to bottom and from left to right in every row (skipping asterisks).\\n\\nThe organizers want for the nameplate to have as few rows as possible and among all valid tables with the minimum number of rows they want to choose the one that has the minimum number of columns.\\n\\nThe winner is not yet determined so your task is to write a program that, given a certain handle, generates the necessary table.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe only line contains one string s (1 \u2264 |s| \u2264 100), comprised of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters, \u2014 the handle of the winner.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nIn the first line output the minimum number a of rows in the table and the minimum number b of columns in an optimal table with rows.\\n\\nThe following a lines should contain b characters each \u2014 any valid table.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nInput\\n\\ntourist\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n1 7\\ntourist\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\nMyNameIsLifeIAmForeverByYourSideMyNameIsLife\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n3 15\\nMyNameIsLifeIAm\\nForeverByYourSi\\ndeMyNameIsL*ife\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def print2d(a):\\n\\tfor i in range(len(a)):\\n\\t\\tprint(''.join(list(map(str, a[i]))))\\nst = input()\\nfor i in range(1, 5 + 1):\\n\\tvst = len(st) // i\\n\\tost = len(st) % i\\n\\tif vst + min(ost, 1) > 20:\\n\\t\\tcontinue\\n\\ta = [0] * i\\n\\tind = 0\\n\\tf = 0\\n\\tfor j in range(len(a)):\\n\\t\\ta[j] = []\\n\\tfor j in range(len(a)):\\n\\t\\tfor k in range(vst):\\n\\t\\t\\ta[j].append(st[ind])\\n\\t\\t\\tind += 1\\n\\t\\tif ost > 0:\\n\\t\\t\\tost -= 1\\n\\t\\t\\ta[j].append(st[ind])\\n\\t\\t\\tind += 1\\n\\t\\t\\tf = 1\\n\\t\\telif f != 0:\\n\\t\\t\\ta[j].append('*')\\n\\tif a[-1][-1] == '*' or a[-1][-1] == st[-1]:\\n\\t\\tprint(len(a), len(a[0]))\\n\\t\\tprint2d(a)\\n\\t\\texit()\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The goal is to arrange a given string (handle) in a rectangular table (nameplate) such that the number of rows (a) is minimized, and among tables with the minimum number of rows, the number of columns (b) is also minimized. The rows should have a uniform number of asterisks. The dimensions of the table are constrained: 1 <= a <= 5 and 1 <= b <= 20.\\n- Identifying Constraints: The table must be filled with the letters of the handle and asterisks. Reading the table row by row should reproduce the handle (asterisks are skipped). The difference in the number of asterisks between rows must be at most one. The table dimensions must adhere to the constraints. Number of rows must be minimum and the number of columns must be minimum for the chosen row.\\n- Choosing an Optimal Table Configuration: Iterate through possible values of rows (1 to 5). For each number of rows, calculate the required number of columns, keeping in mind that the columns must be kept to a minimum. Check if the calculated number of rows and columns are within constraints. If not, proceed to the next possible row number. The handle is laid out row by row. The remaining cells are filled with asterisks.\\n- Table Generation and Output: Once the optimal number of rows and columns are determined, generate the table. Fill the table with the handle's characters row by row. If any cell remains, fill it with an asterisk. Output the optimal table with the correct dimensions.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the main constraints on the number of rows and columns of the table?\",\n    \"How can you ensure that the difference in the number of asterisks between any two rows is at most one?\",\n    \"What is the most efficient way to determine the number of rows (a) and columns (b) for the nameplate?\",\n    \"How should you fill the nameplate to ensure the handle appears correctly when read from top to bottom and left to right, skipping the asterisks?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases to consider when determining the dimensions of the table and filling the content?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The number of rows (a) must be between 1 and 5, and the number of columns (b) must be between 1 and 20.\",\n    \"To keep the asterisks uniform, compute the number of asterisks to fill in the table and distribute among the rows such that each row contains at most one different number of asterisks from each other.\",\n    \"Iterate through the possible number of rows starting from 1 to 5. Calculate the corresponding number of columns needed to fit the string. Break out once you find a possible config such that number of rows and columns are within constraints.\",\n    \"First, fill in the handle's characters row by row, and append asterisks to the end of each row until each has the appropriate length.\",\n    \"Edge cases include when the length of the handle is zero (empty string). Also, ensure that the calculation for minimum columns considers the length of the handle and adheres to constraints.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
