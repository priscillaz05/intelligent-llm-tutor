Anagrams are strings that contain the same characters, regardless of their order. The substrings need to be identified and then checked for being anagrams of each other.\\n- Breaking Down the Solution: Iterate through all possible substrings of the given string. For each substring, sort its characters to create a standardized form. Use a dictionary (hash map) to store the counts of each sorted substring. If a sorted substring is already in the dictionary, it means an anagramic pair has been found. Update the count and dictionary accordingly.\\n- Optimization and Edge Cases: The code needs to handle cases efficiently where multiple anagramic pairs are present. Empty substrings should be avoided, or their impact correctly handled. Consider the constraints on input sizes to ensure efficient computation.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What defines an anagramic pair of substrings, and how does sorting the substrings help in identifying them?\",\n    \"How should the dictionary be structured to efficiently count anagramic pairs, and what information should be stored in it?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases, such as an empty string or very long strings, and how would they affect the algorithm's efficiency?\",\n    \"What are the time and space complexity implications of this approach, especially considering the constraints?\",\n    \"Are there any alternative data structures or algorithms that can potentially improve the performance of identifying anagramic pairs?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"An anagramic pair consists of two substrings that contain the same characters, but possibly in a different order. Sorting the substrings provides a canonical form, so two substrings are anagrams if and only if their sorted forms are identical.\",\n    \"The dictionary should map the sorted substring to its frequency of occurrence. This allows efficient counting of anagramic pairs by incrementing the count whenever a sorted substring is already in the dictionary.\",\n    \"Edge cases include empty strings (which should return 0), strings with no anagrams, and long strings that might impact performance. The algorithm needs to be efficient enough to handle strings up to 100 characters long within the given constraints.\",\n    \"The time complexity is O(n^3 log n) due to generating O(n^2) substrings and sorting each one (O(n log n)). The space complexity is O(n^2) in the worst case, as the dictionary might store a large number of unique sorted substrings.\",\n    \"Potentially, using character frequency counts instead of sorting might provide a slight optimization, but the overall complexity would likely remain similar. Hashing algorithms could be used to improve performance as well.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
