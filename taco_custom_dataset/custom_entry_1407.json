The dictionary keys will store the words and will automatically handle uniqueness.\\n- String Reconstruction: After identifying and removing duplicates, the remaining unique words must be joined back into a string, preserving the initial order.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean to remove duplicate words while preserving the original order?\",\n    \"Why is it important to use the first occurrence of each word instead of the last?\",\n    \"Can you suggest a data structure that effectively handles uniqueness and preserves insertion order?\",\n    \"How would you reconstruct the string after removing the duplicate words?\",\n    \"What edge cases might you encounter, such as an empty string or a string with no duplicates, and how would your solution handle them?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"It means that if a word appears multiple times in the string, only its first appearance should be kept, and all subsequent occurrences should be removed. The resulting string should maintain the initial sequence of unique words.\",\n    \"It's important to use the first occurrence because the problem specifies that only the 'single (first) words entries' should be retained. The later occurrences are considered duplicates to be removed.\",\n    \"A dictionary (specifically, using dict.fromkeys in Python) is ideal because it automatically handles uniqueness (keys are unique), and in Python 3.7+, dictionaries preserve insertion order.\",\n    \"After identifying the unique words, I would join them back together with spaces in between to form a single string, ensuring that the original order is maintained.\",\n    \"Edge cases include an empty string, which should return an empty string, and a string with no duplicates, which should return the original string. The solution should handle these cases gracefully without errors.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
