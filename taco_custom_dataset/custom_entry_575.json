You can only move down or right.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Consider cases where no paths exist, when K is smaller than the value at (0,0), or when K is larger than the sum of all values in a path from (0,0) to (N-1,N-1). Overlapping subproblems suggest the use of dynamic programming or memoization.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: A dynamic programming approach with memoization can efficiently solve this problem. A 3D DP array dp[i][j][k] can store the number of paths from (0,0) to (i,j) with a sum of k coins.\\n- Implementing the Recursive Relation: Define a recursive function that explores the paths, subtracting the current cell's value from K. If the target K becomes zero at the destination cell (N-1, N-1), increment the count of possible paths. Use memoization to store and reuse results.\\n- Handling Base Cases: Establish base cases for when i or j are out of bounds or when K becomes negative, returning 0 in these cases. The base case for reaching the destination cell determines whether a valid path has been found.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the possible movements from any given cell in the matrix, and how do these movements affect the problem's solution?\",\n    \"If the target sum K is less than the value at the starting cell (0, 0), or if it becomes negative during the traversal, what does this imply for finding valid paths?\",\n    \"How can dynamic programming with memoization be applied to avoid redundant calculations and improve the efficiency of the path-finding process?\",\n    \"What conditions must be met when reaching the destination cell (N-1, N-1) to confirm that a valid path has been found with the target sum K?\",\n    \"What is the purpose of the dp array and what does dp[i][j][k] store?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"From each cell (i, j), you can only move to (i+1, j) or (i, j+1). Each move adds the value of the new cell to the path's coin sum, influencing whether the sum equals K at the destination.\",\n    \"If K is less than the value at (0, 0) or becomes negative, it means there are no valid paths from that point to the destination with the target sum.
