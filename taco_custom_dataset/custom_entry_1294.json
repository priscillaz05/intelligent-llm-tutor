The top left pipe has the coordinates $(1, 1)$ and the bottom right \u2014 $(2, n)$.\\n\\nThere are six types of pipes: two types of straight pipes and four types of curved pipes. Here are the examples of all six types:\\n\\n [Image] Types of pipes \\n\\nYou can turn each of the given pipes $90$ degrees clockwise or counterclockwise arbitrary (possibly, zero) number of times (so the types $1$ and $2$ can become each other and types $3, 4, 5, 6$ can become each other).\\n\\nYou want to turn some pipes in a way that the water flow can start at $(1, 0)$ (to the left of the top left pipe), move to the pipe at $(1, 1)$, flow somehow by connected pipes to the pipe at $(2, n)$ and flow right to $(2, n + 1)$.\\n\\nPipes are connected if they are adjacent in the system and their ends are connected. Here are examples of connected pipes:\\n\\n [Image] Examples of connected pipes \\n\\nLet's describe the problem using some example:\\n\\n [Image] The first example input \\n\\nAnd its solution is below:  [Image] The first example answer \\n\\nAs you can see, the water flow is the poorly drawn blue line. To obtain the answer, we need to turn the pipe at $(1, 2)$ $90$ degrees clockwise, the pipe at $(2, 3)$ $90$ degrees, the pipe at $(1, 6)$ $90$ degrees, the pipe at $(1, 7)$ $180$ degrees and the pipe at $(2, 7)$ $180$ degrees. Then the flow of water can reach $(2, n + 1)$ from $(1, 0)$.\\n\\nYou have to answer $q$ independent queries.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $q$ ($1 \\\\le q \\\\le 10^4$) \u2014 the number of queries. Then $q$ queries follow.\\n\\nEach query consists of exactly three lines. The first line of the query contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of pipes in each row. The next two lines contain a description of the first and the second rows correspondingly. Each row description consists of $n$ digits from $1$ to $6$ without any whitespaces between them, each digit corresponds to the type of pipe in the corresponding cell. See the problem statement to understand which digits correspond to which types of pipes.\\n\\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all queries does not exceed $2 \\\\cdot 10^5$.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nFor the $i$-th query print the answer for it \u2014 \\\"YES\\\" (without quotes) if it is possible to turn some pipes in a way that the water flow can reach $(2, n + 1)$ from $(1, 0)$, and \\\"NO\\\" otherwise.\\n\\n\\n-----Example-----\\nInput\\n6\\n7\\n2323216\\n1615124\\n1\\n3\\n4\\n2\\n13\\n24\\n2\\n12\\n34\\n3\\n536\\n345\\n2\\n46\\n54\\n\\nOutput\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO\\nYES\\nNO\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nThe first query from the example is described in the problem statement.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def pipetype(i):\\n\\tif i == '1' or i == '2':\\n\\t\\treturn 1\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\treturn 2\\n\\ndef find_way2(arr, n):\\n\\tcount = 0\\n\\trow = 0\\n\\tcol = 0\\n\\tprev_row = 0\\n\\tprev_col = -1\\n\\tprev_state = 1\\n\\twhile col <= n:\\n\\t\\tcount += 1\\n\\t\\tprev_i = row\\n\\t\\tprev_j = col\\n\\t\\tif col == n and row == 0:\\n\\t\\t\\treturn 'NO'\\n\\t\\telif col == n and row == 1:\\n\\t\\t\\treturn 'YES'\\n\\t\\tif pipetype(arr[row][col]) == 1:\\n\\t\\t\\tif row == prev_row:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcol += 1\\n\\t\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn 'NO'\\n\\t\\telif pipetype(arr[row][col]) == 2:\\n\\t\\t\\tif row == 0 and prev_row == 0:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trow += 1\\n\\t\\t\\telif row == 0 and prev_row == 1:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcol += 1\\n\\t\\t\\telif row == 1 and prev_row == 0:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcol += 1\\n\\t\\t\\telif row == 1 and prev_row == 1:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trow -= 1\\n\\t\\tprev_row = prev_i\\n\\t\\tprev_col = prev_j\\n\\treturn 'YES'\\nfor i in range(int(input())):\\n\\tn = int(input())\\n\\tarr = [input()]\\n\\tarr.append(input())\\n\\tprint(find_way2(arr, n))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding Pipe Types: Recognize that pipe types 1 and 2 can be considered as one category (straight), and pipe types 3, 4, 5, and 6 can be considered as another (curved). Determine the connectivity rules for each pipe type.\\n- Exploring Connectivity: Understand that straight pipes can only connect horizontally within the same row. Curved pipes can connect either to the opposite row or horizontally within the same row.\\n- Identifying a Traversal Strategy: Plan a traversal strategy starting from (1, 1) to reach (2, n). Evaluate each step to determine if the water flow can proceed.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Consider edge cases where the path is blocked by incompatible pipe configurations. Also, account for the final condition to reach (2, n + 1).\\n- Optimizing for Efficiency: Minimize unnecessary movements and determine the path efficiently to avoid timeouts, especially with larger input sizes.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do pipe types 1 and 2 differ from types 3, 4, 5, and 6 in terms of connectivity?\",\n    \"What are the possible movements from a given pipe location, considering both straight and curved pipes?\",\n    \"Given a current position (row, column), how can you determine the next possible position based on the pipe type?\",\n    \"What conditions would cause the traversal to fail, making it impossible to reach (2, n + 1)?\",\n    \"How would you represent the pipe layout to facilitate easy traversal and connectivity checks?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Pipe types 1 and 2 are straight and allow horizontal connectivity within the same row.
