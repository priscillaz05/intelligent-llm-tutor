"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"Manao is taking part in a quiz. The quiz consists of n consecutive questions. A correct answer gives one point to the player. The game also has a counter of consecutive correct answers. When the player answers a question correctly, the number on this counter increases by 1. If the player answers a question incorrectly, the counter is reset, that is, the number on it reduces to 0. If after an answer the counter reaches the number k, then it is reset, and the player's score is doubled. Note that in this case, first 1 point is added to the player's score, and then the total score is doubled. At the beginning of the game, both the player's score and the counter of consecutive correct answers are set to zero.\\n\\nManao remembers that he has answered exactly m questions correctly. But he does not remember the order in which the questions came. He's trying to figure out what his minimum score may be. Help him and compute the remainder of the corresponding number after division by 1000000009 (10^9 + 9).\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe single line contains three space-separated integers n, m and k (2 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 10^9;\u00a00 \u2264 m \u2264 n).\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the remainder from division of Manao's minimum possible score in the quiz by 1000000009 (10^9 + 9).\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n5 3 2\\n\\nOutput\\n3\\n\\nInput\\n5 4 2\\n\\nOutput\\n6\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nSample 1. Manao answered 3 questions out of 5, and his score would double for each two consecutive correct answers. If Manao had answered the first, third and fifth questions, he would have scored as much as 3 points.\\n\\nSample 2. Now Manao answered 4 questions. The minimum possible score is obtained when the only wrong answer is to the question 4.\\n\\nAlso note that you are asked to minimize the score and not the remainder of the score modulo 1000000009. For example, if Manao could obtain either 2000000000 or 2000000020 points, the answer is 2000000000\u00a0mod\u00a01000000009, even though 2000000020\u00a0mod\u00a01000000009 is a smaller number.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())\\nMOD = 1000000009\\nx = m - (n // k * (k - 1) + n % k)\\nif x <= 0:\\n\\tprint(m % MOD)\\n\\treturn\\nprint((m - x + (pow(2, x + 1, MOD) + 2 * MOD - 2) * k - x * (k - 1)) % MOD)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem describes a quiz where correct answers increment the score and a consecutive correct answer counter. When the counter reaches k, the score doubles. The goal is to find the minimum possible score given n (total questions), m (correct answers), and k (consecutive correct answer threshold), modulo 1000000009.\\n- Strategy for Minimization: To minimize the score, we need to minimize the number of score doublings. This can be achieved by spreading out the correct answers as much as possible to avoid consecutive correct answers reaching k.\\n- Deriving the Formula: The crucial part is finding the minimum number of doublings. If we can avoid any doublings, the score is simply m. To maximize wrong answers between correct answers, we want to arrange them so no k consecutive correct answers are present except when absolutely necessary. We calculate how many correct answers can be placed such that there are k-1 correct answers between incorrect ones until we need to use the streak to get the remaining points. \\n- Handling Modulo: All arithmetic operations, particularly exponentiation, should be performed modulo 1000000009 to prevent overflow.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does the consecutive correct answer counter affect the score?\",\n    \"What strategy should be used to minimize the total score?\",\n    \"How can the number of doublings be minimized?\",\n    \"How should we deal with the modulo operation to ensure the output is within the specified range?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The counter increases by 1 for each correct answer and resets to 0 after an incorrect answer. When it reaches k, the current score doubles.\",\n    \"To minimize the score, avoid having k consecutive correct answers as much as possible, since it doubles the score.\",\n    \"To minimize doublings, spread the m correct answers as much as possible by placing incorrect answers between them.\",\n    \"Perform all arithmetic operations modulo 1000000009 to prevent overflow and to ensure the output is within the specified range.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
