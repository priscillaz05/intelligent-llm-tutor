The coordinates of the four vertices are (0,0), (W,0), (W,H), and (0,H).\\nYou are given a point (x,y) which is within the rectangle or on its border. We will draw a straight line passing through (x,y) to cut the rectangle into two parts. Find the maximum possible area of the part whose area is not larger than that of the other. Additionally, determine if there are multiple ways to cut the rectangle and achieve that maximum.\\n\\n-----Constraints-----\\n - 1 \\\\leq W,H \\\\leq 10^9\\n - 0\\\\leq x\\\\leq W\\n - 0\\\\leq y\\\\leq H\\n - All values in input are integers.\\n\\n-----Input-----\\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\\nW H x y\\n\\n-----Output-----\\nPrint the maximum possible area of the part whose area is not larger than that of the other, followed by 1 if there are multiple ways to cut the rectangle and achieve that maximum, and 0 otherwise.\\nThe area printed will be judged correct when its absolute or relative error is at most 10^{-9}.\\n\\n-----Sample Input-----\\n2 3 1 2\\n\\n-----Sample Output-----\\n3.000000 0\\n\\nThe line x=1 gives the optimal cut, and no other line does.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"(a, b, x, y) = map(int, input().split())\\nprint(a * b / 2, int(x + x == a and y + y == b))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Geometric Constraints: Recognize that regardless of how the line is drawn through the point (x, y), the goal is to cut the rectangle such that the area of the smaller part is maximized. This implies that the optimal cut will divide the rectangle into two equal areas.\\n- Identifying the Optimal Cut: Realize that the line that divides the rectangle into two equal parts must pass through the center of the rectangle. The center is at (W/2, H/2).\\n- Determining Multiple Optimal Cuts: Check if the given point (x, y) is the center of the rectangle. If (x, y) coincides with (W/2, H/2), then any line passing through this point will divide the rectangle into two equal parts, implying multiple optimal cuts. Otherwise, only the line passing through the center will result in equal areas.\\n- Calculating Area and Output: Calculate half of the total area of the rectangle (W * H / 2). Output this area along with a flag indicating whether multiple optimal cuts exist (1 if x == W/2 and y == H/2, 0 otherwise).\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the relationship between the point (x, y) and the center of the rectangle in achieving equal areas?\",\n    \"How do you determine if there are multiple lines that result in the same maximum area for the smaller part?\",\n    \"What is the maximum possible area for the smaller part of the rectangle, and how is it derived?\",\n    \"How can the coordinates of the rectangle and the given point be used to find the optimal line for cutting?\",\n    \"What conditions must be met to indicate multiple optimal cut lines through the rectangle?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The optimal cut that maximizes the area of the smaller part will always pass through the center of the rectangle.\",\n    \"If the given point (x, y) is located at the center of the rectangle, then any line passing through (x, y) will divide the rectangle into equal halves, indicating multiple optimal cuts.\",\n    \"The maximum possible area for the smaller part is half the total area of the rectangle (W * H / 2).\",\n    \"Compare the given point's coordinates (x, y) with the coordinates of the rectangle's center (W/2, H/2) to determine if the cut is optimal.
