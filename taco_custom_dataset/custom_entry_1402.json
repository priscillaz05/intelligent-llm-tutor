In one turn, both of them roll their dice at once.\\n\\nThey consider a turn to be *good* if the sum of the numbers on their dice is greater than 6.  \\nGiven that in a particular turn Chef and Chefina got X and Y on their respective dice, find whether the turn was good.\\n\\n------ Input Format ------ \\n\\n- The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.\\n- Each test case contains two space-separated integers X and Y \u2014 the numbers Chef and Chefina got on their respective dice.\\n\\n------ Output Format ------ \\n\\nFor each test case, output on a new line, YES, if the turn was good and NO otherwise.\\n\\nEach character of the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase. That is, the strings NO, no, nO, and No will be treated as equivalent.\\n\\n------ Constraints ------ \\n\\n$1 \u2264 T \u2264 100$\\n$1 \u2264 X, Y \u2264 6$\\n\\n----- Sample Input 1 ------ \\n4\\n1 4\\n3 4\\n4 2\\n2 6\\n\\n----- Sample Output 1 ------ \\nNO\\nYES\\nNO\\nYES\\n\\n----- explanation 1 ------ \\nTest case $1$: The sum of numbers on the dice is $1+4 = 5$ which is smaller than $6$. Thus, the turn is not good.\\n\\nTest case $2$: The sum of numbers on the dice is $3+4 = 7$ which is greater than $6$. Thus, the turn is good.\\n\\nTest case $3$: The sum of numbers on the dice is $4+2 = 6$ which is equal to $6$. Thus, the turn is not good.\\n\\nTest case $4$: The sum of numbers on the dice is $2+6 = 8$ which is greater than $6$. Thus, the turn is good.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"n = int(input())\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\t(x, y) = map(int, input().split())\\n\\tif x + y > 6:\\n\\t\\tprint('YES')\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tprint('NO')\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the problem: The problem requires reading two dice values, calculating their sum, and determining if the sum is greater than 6.\\n- Handling input: Read the number of test cases, and for each test case, read the two dice values.\\n- Conditional check: Implement a conditional statement to check if the sum is greater than 6. If it is, print 'YES'; otherwise, print 'NO'.\\n- Output formatting: Ensure the output matches the specified format, where 'YES' or 'NO' is printed for each test case.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the constraints on the dice values X and Y, and how do they affect the possible sums?\",\n    \"How should the program handle multiple test cases?\",\n    \"What conditional statement can be used to check if the sum of the dice values is greater than 6?\",\n    \"How should the output be formatted to match the problem description?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"X and Y are integers between 1 and 6 inclusive. This means the minimum sum is 2 and the maximum sum is 12.\",\n    \"The program should read the number of test cases T and then iterate T times, processing each test case independently.\",\n    \"An if statement can be used to check if X + Y > 6. If the condition is true, print 'YES'; otherwise, print 'NO'.\",\n    \"The output should be 'YES' if the sum is greater than 6 and 'NO' otherwise, each on a new line. The case of the output ('YES' or 'NO') is not important.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
