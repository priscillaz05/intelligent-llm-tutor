Sentences end with '.', '?', or '!', or are the last part of the text. Words are strings of alphabetic characters, separated by spaces.\\n- Identifying Edge Cases: Consider cases with empty strings, strings with no spaces, strings with multiple consecutive punctuation marks, and strings that don't end with punctuation.\\n- Choosing an Algorithm: Iterate through the string. Increment the word count when a space is encountered. Increment the sentence count when a sentence-ending punctuation mark is found, but only if it is not immediately followed by another punctuation mark. Initialize both sentence and word count as 1 to account for the edge cases where the final sentence might not have a punctuation mark, or there is only one word.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Handle edge cases where the last character might or might not be a sentence-ending punctuation. Account for the definition of words using space separated words. Avoid counting consecutive punctuation marks as multiple sentences.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you define a word and a sentence in this problem?\",\n    \"What initial values should you set for the sentence and word counters, and why?\",\n    \"How do you handle the case where a sentence does not end with a punctuation mark?\",\n    \"What is the condition to check if a sentence-ending punctuation mark is actually ending a sentence?\",\n    \"How should you address cases with consecutive punctuation marks?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A word is defined as a string of alphabetic characters. A sentence is defined as a contiguous string of characters ending with '.', '?', or '!', or the last contiguous set of space-separated strings.\",\n    \"Both counters should be initialized to 1.

Therefore, we need to ensure the last part is counted as a sentence even if no punctuation mark is available.\",\n    \"You need to check if the next character is also a punctuation mark. If it is, then the current punctuation does not end a sentence.\",\n    \"Consecutive punctuation marks should be treated as part of the same sentence.  Only the first punctuation mark in the sequence that is not followed by another punctuation mark should increment the sentence count.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
