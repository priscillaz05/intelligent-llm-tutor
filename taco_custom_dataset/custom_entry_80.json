The result should be modulo 10^9 + 7.\\n- Identifying the Approach: Realize that we can analyze the problem by considering the number of 'b's and 'c's used in the string. If we use zero 'b' and zero 'c', then we only have 'a' to use, which contributes 1 way. If we use one 'b', then we can put this 'b' in any one of 'n' positions and fill the rest with 'a's. If we use one 'c', then we can put this 'c' in any one of 'n' positions and fill the rest with 'a's. If we use two 'c's, then we select two positions for the 'c's among 'n' positions. Finally, we can also use one 'b' and one 'c'. The 'b' can be at any of 'n' positions, and the 'c' can be at any of 'n-1' remaining positions. If we use one 'b' and two 'c's, the 'b' can be at any of n positions, the two 'c's can be at any of (n-1) * (n-2) / 2 positions. \\n- Deriving the Formula:  After accounting for all possible cases we can represent the number of possible strings as nC0 + nC1 + nC2 + nC1 * (n-1)C1 + nC2 * (n-1)C1 * + nC1 + nC1 * nC1, which translates to 1(no b or c) + n (1 'b') + n (1 'c') + n(n-1)/2 (2 'c's) + n(n-1) ('b', 'c') + n(n-1)(n-2) /2 ('b', 2 'c's). This simplifies to calculating 1 + n + n + (n * (n - 1))//2  + n * (n -1) = 1 + 2*n + n*(n-1)*(n+2)//2 = 1 + 2n + n(n^2-1)/2.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Ensure intermediate calculations are performed modulo 10^9 + 7 to avoid integer overflow.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean to find the number of strings with the given constraints, and what characters can be used?\",\n    \"If n = 1, what are the possible strings?\",\n    \"If 'b' can only appear once, how many positions can 'b' occupy in a string of length 'n'?\",\n    \"If 'c' can appear at most twice, how many ways can we place two 'c's in a string of length 'n'?\",\n    \"How can you handle the constraint that the number of strings should be modulo 10^9 + 7?\",\n    \"How do you determine the total number of possible strings by combining different cases (e.g., no 'b' and 'c', one 'b', one 'c', etc.)?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"It means counting all the possible combinations of characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' to form strings of length 'n', subject to the given constraints on the number of times 'b' and 'c' can appear.\",\n    \"The possible strings are 'a', 'b', and 'c', so there are 3.\",\n    \"'b' can occupy any of the 'n' positions in the string.\",\n    \"Two 'c's can occupy nC2 positions, which is n*(n-1)/2.\",\n    \"Perform all intermediate calculations modulo 10^9 + 7 to prevent integer overflow, and take the modulo of the final result as well.\",\n    \"By considering each case (no 'b' and 'c', one 'b', one 'c', two 'c's, one 'b' and one 'c', etc.) and summing up the possibilities for each case while using modulo arithmetic.
