That is, a pile is too tall if it has more sand than its two neighbours combined. (Note that piles on the ends of the array cannot be too tall.)\\n\\nYou are given an integer $k$. An operation consists of picking $k$ consecutive piles of sand and adding one unit of sand to them all. Formally, pick $1 \\\\leq l,r \\\\leq n$ such that $r-l+1=k$. Then for all $l \\\\leq i \\\\leq r$, update $a_i \\\\gets a_i+1$.\\n\\nWhat is the maximum number of piles that can simultaneously be too tall after some (possibly zero) operations?\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 1000$) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\\n\\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($3 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2 \\\\cdot 10^5$; $1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq n$) \u2014 the number of piles of sand and the size of the operation, respectively.\\n\\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 10^9$) \u2014 the sizes of the piles.\\n\\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\\\cdot 10^5$.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nFor each test case, output a single integer \u2014 the maximum number of piles that are simultaneously too tall after some (possibly zero) operations.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\n\\nInput\\n3\\n5 2\\n2 9 2 4 1\\n4 4\\n1 3 2 1\\n3 1\\n1 3 1\\nOutput\\n2\\n0\\n1\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first test case, we can perform the following three operations:\\n\\nAdd one unit of sand to piles $1$ and $2$: $[{3}, {10}, 2, 4, 1]$.\\n\\nAdd one unit of sand to piles $4$ and $5$: $[3, 10, 2, {5}, {2}]$.\\n\\nAdd one unit of sand to piles $3$ and $4$: $[3, 10, {3}, {6}, 2]$.\\n\\nNow piles $2$ and $4$ are too tall, so in this case the answer is $2$. It can be shown that it is impossible to make more than $2$ piles too tall.\\n\\nIn the second test case, any operation will increase all piles by $1$ unit, so the number of too tall piles will always be $0$.\\n\\nIn the third test case, we can increase any pile by $1$ unit of sand. It can be shown that the maximum number of too tall piles is $1$.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"z = lambda : map(int, input().split())\\n(t,) = z()\\nfor _ in '_' * t:\\n\\t(n, k) = z()\\n\\tl = [*z()]\\n\\tif k != 1:\\n\\t\\tprint(sum((x + y < z for (x, z, y) in zip(l, l[1:], l[2:]))))\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tprint((n - 1) // 2)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem Requirements: Understand the definition of a 'too tall' pile and the constraints on its position. Recognize that operations involve adding one unit to k consecutive piles.\\n- Identifying Key Insight for k = 1: When k = 1, any single pile can be incremented. To maximize the number of too tall piles, incrementing only the piles at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) maximizes the number of too tall piles. Specifically, a pile at index i will be too tall if a[i] > a[i-1] + a[i+1] after incrementing it. In this case we maximize it by incrementing all the odd indices.\\n- Identifying Key Insight for k > 1: When k > 1, consider that all piles can be made to have approximately the same height by applying operations many times. Thus, a pile i will be too tall only if a[i] was initially greater than a[i-1] + a[i+1]. The operations tend to equalize the piles, making it less likely for a pile to be too tall unless it was already so.\\n- Edge Cases: Consider the cases when k = 1 and when k > 1.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What constitutes a 'too tall' pile, and what are the position constraints?\",\n    \"If k = 1, how can the number of 'too tall' piles be maximized?\",\n    \"If k > 1, how do the operations affect the pile heights, and what condition must be satisfied for a pile to be 'too tall'?\",\n    \"What are the relevant edge cases, especially concerning the value of k?\",\n    \"Can you provide an example test case and walk through how the solution would determine the maximum number of 'too tall' piles?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A 'too tall' pile is one where the sand it contains is strictly greater than the combined sand of its immediate neighbors. Only piles strictly inside the array (excluding the first and last) can be 'too tall'.\",\n    \"If k = 1, the number of too tall piles is maximized when we increment all the odd indexed piles. Then we can determine how many odd indices fulfill that a[i] > a[i-1] + a[i+1].\",\n    \"If k > 1, the operations tend to equalize the pile heights. For a pile to be too tall in the end, it must have been initially taller than the sum of its neighbors. So just count how many indices fulfill a[i] > a[i-1] + a[i+1] before the operations.\",\n    \"The crucial edge case is the distinction between k = 1 and k > 1. The strategy changes significantly based on this value.\",\n    \"Consider the test case n = 5, k = 2, and piles = [2, 9, 2, 4, 1].
