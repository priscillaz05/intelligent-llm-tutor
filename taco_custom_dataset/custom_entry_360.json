These numbers are of the form (2^k - 1) - 2^j where k is the length of the binary number, and j is the position of the zero.\\n- Generate Possible Numbers: Generate all possible numbers with exactly one zero in their binary form and check if they fall within the specified range [a, b]. The maximum possible value for the input is 10^18, so we need to iterate over the possible lengths of the binary representation (k) and the positions of the zero (j).\\n- Optimizations/Constraints: The maximum binary length can be determined by observing that 2^60 is approximately 10^18. We can precompute all numbers of the specified binary form up to a length of 60, then check if those numbers fall within the given range.\\n- Edge Cases: We need to handle cases where a or b are extremely large, so we will limit our binary representation to 60 bits.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you represent numbers with exactly one zero in their binary representation?\",\n    \"What is the maximum possible number of bits needed to represent the given input range?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently generate all possible numbers with exactly one zero within the required range?\",\n    \"What constraints do we have to take into account based on the input size?\",\n    \"What is the strategy to count the number of years within a given interval that have exactly one zero in the binary representation?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Numbers with exactly one zero can be written as a sequence of 1s with a single 0, and can be generated as (2^k - 1) - 2^j, where k is the total number of bits and j is the position of the zero.\",\n    \"Since the maximum input is 10^18, we need to go up to about 60 bits because 2^60 is approximately 10^18.\",\n    \"We can use nested loops: the outer loop iterates through the binary length (k), and the inner loop iterates through the position of the zero (j).
