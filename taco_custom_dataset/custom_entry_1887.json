He places a Queen at (X, Y) and wonders - What are the number of cells that are under attack by the Queen? \\n\\nNotes:\\nThe top-left cell is (1, 1), the top-right cell is (1, N), the bottom-left cell is (N,1) and the bottom-right cell is (N, N).\\nThe Queen can be moved any number of unoccupied cells in a straight line vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.\\nThe cell on which the Queen is present, is not said to be under attack by the Queen.\\n\\n------ Input Format ------ \\n\\n- The first line contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\\n- The first and only line of each test case contains three integers N, X and Y, as described in the problem statement. \\n\\n------ Output Format ------ \\n\\nFor each test case, output in a single line, the total number of cells that are under attack by the Queen. \\n\\n------ Constraints ------ \\n\\n$1 \u2264 T \u2264 10^{4}$\\n$1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^{6}$\\n$1 \u2264 X, Y \u2264 N$\\n\\n----- Sample Input 1 ------ \\n5\\n1 1 1\\n3 2 2\\n3 2 1\\n2 2 2\\n150 62 41\\n\\n----- Sample Output 1 ------ \\n0\\n8\\n6\\n3\\n527\\n\\n----- explanation 1 ------ \\nTest case 1: The only cell on the board is $(1,1)$. Since Queen stands on this cell, it is not under attack.\\n\\nTest case 2: The Queen can attack the following cells: $\\{(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)\\}.\\n\\nTest case 3: The Queen can attack the following cells: $\\{(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2)\\}.\\n\\nTest case 4: The Queen can attack the following cells: $\\{(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1)\\}.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"for _ in range(int(input())):\\n\\t(n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())\\n\\tst = 2 * n - 2\\n\\tcross = 0\\n\\tif x == 1 or y == 1 or x == n or (y == n):\\n\\t\\tcross = n - 1\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tcross = min(x, y) - 1 + (n - max(x, y))\\n\\t\\tcross += min(x - 1, n - y) + min(n - x, y - 1)\\n\\tprint(st + cross)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the problem: The problem asks to calculate the number of cells under attack by a queen on an N x N chessboard, given the queen's position (X, Y).\\n- Identifying attack directions: The queen attacks horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. The cell the queen occupies is not under attack.\\n- Calculating horizontal and vertical attacks: The queen attacks N-1 cells horizontally and N-1 cells vertically.  So, 2 * N - 2 cells are under horizontal or vertical attack.\\n- Calculating diagonal attacks: Count the cells attacked diagonally in each of the four diagonal directions. The number of diagonal cells attacked depends on the position of the queen. Consider edge cases where the queen is on the edge of the board.\\n- Combining the counts: Add the number of horizontal/vertical attacks to the number of diagonal attacks.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How many cells does the Queen attack horizontally and vertically, given the board size N?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the number of cells attacked diagonally in each of the four diagonal directions?\",\n    \"How do you handle the edge cases where the queen is positioned at the edge of the chessboard?\",\n    \"What is the formula to calculate the number of cells under attack given the queen's coordinates (X,Y) and board size N?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The queen attacks N-1 cells horizontally and N-1 cells vertically, which gives a total of 2 * N - 2 cells attacked in these directions.\",\n    \"To calculate the number of cells attacked diagonally, determine the distance to the edge of the board in each diagonal direction (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) from the queen's position. The minimum of the distances in opposite diagonal directions determines the number of cells attacked in those diagonal directions.  Sum the number of diagonal cells attacked.\",\n    \"If the queen is on an edge (X=1, X=N, Y=1, Y=N), the calculation of diagonal attacks changes.  For example, if X=1, some of the diagonals are limited by the edge. Adjust the calculations accordingly.\",\n    \"The total number of attacked cells is the sum of horizontal/vertical attacks (2 * N - 2) and the number of diagonal attacks, which depends on the Queen's position (X, Y).\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
