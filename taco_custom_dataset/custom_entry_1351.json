"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"There are a **n** balls numbered from 0 to **n-1** (0,1,2,3,etc). Most of them have the same weight, but one is heavier. Your task is to find it.\\n\\nYour function will receive two arguments - a `scales` object, and a ball count. The `scales` object has only one method:\\n\\n```python\\n    get_weight(left, right)\\n```\\n\\nwhere `left` and `right` are arrays of numbers of balls to put on left and right pan respectively.\\n\\nIf the method returns `-1` - left pan is heavier\\n\\nIf the method returns `1` - right pan is heavier\\n\\nIf the method returns `0` - both pans weigh the same\\n\\nSo what makes this the \\\"ubermaster\\\" version of this kata? First, it's not restricted to 8 balls as in the previous versions - your solution has to work for 8-500 balls. \\n\\nSecond, you can't use the scale any more than mathematically necessary. Here's a chart:\\n\\n    ball count | uses\\n    -----------------\\n           0-9 |    2\\n         10-27 |    3\\n         28-81 |    4\\n        82-243 |    5\\n       244-500 |    6\\n\\nToo hard?

The input 'n' ranges from 8 to 500, and the maximum number of allowed `get_weight` calls increases logarithmically with 'n'.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: The number of calls to scales.get_weight() is limited based on n. It is vital to ensure the calls are less than or equal to the specified limit. A naive implementation might exceed the permitted calls. Also handling the situation when n%3 == 1 requires special care to ensure even distribution\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Divide and conquer appears to be the appropriate strategy to use. Partition the balls into three groups, and use scales.get_weight() to determine which contains the heavier ball.\\n- Implementing the Comparisons: Iterate through the balls, using scales.get_weight to compare groups, refining the potential pool in each iteration. The balls are divided to three groups, and the group which contains the heavier ball replaces the current ball range in each iteration.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the key constraints for solving this problem effectively?\",\n    \"What is the maximum number of allowed calls to `scales.get_weight` based on the number of balls?\",\n    \"How would you divide the balls into groups for each comparison, and what are the advantages of using a divide-and-conquer approach?\",\n    \"How will you deal with the case when the number of balls are not divisible by 3 and you need to have even distribution between the left, right and unused balls?\",\n    \"How will you refine the list of possible heavier balls after each comparison?\",\n    \"How can you ensure the minimum number of comparisons is performed?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The key constraint is the limitation on the number of calls to `scales.get_weight`, which is logarithmically related to the total number of balls.\",\n    \"The maximum number of calls allowed varies depending on the number of balls. For 8-9 balls its 2, for 10-27 its 3, for 28-81 its 4, for 82-243 its 5 and for 244-500 it's 6\",\n    \"I would divide the balls into three groups for each comparison: left, right, and unused. Divide and conquer reduces the problem size and quickly narrows down the search space for the heavier ball.\",\n    \"If len(select) % 3 == 1, the last ball is moved from the 'left' list to the unused 'list'\",\n    \"After each comparison using `scales.get_weight`, I will update the list of possible heavier balls based on the result (-1, 0, or 1). This will reduce the number of balls to consider in subsequent iterations.\",\n    \"By splitting into thirds each time, we are minimizing the number of comparisons since each call reduces the search space significantly.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
