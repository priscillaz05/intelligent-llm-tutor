Recognize the relationships between the cost of insertions (I), deletions (D), swaps (W), and replacements (R_{a,b}).\\n- Identifying Optimal Strategies: Evaluate scenarios where direct replacements are cheaper than insertion-deletion pairs. Recognize the potential use of swaps to minimize replacements.\\n- Edge Case Consideration: Consider the impact of the lengths of S and T on the transformation strategy. If S is shorter than T, insertions will be necessary; if S is longer, deletions will be needed.\\n- Formulating the Algorithm: Compare S and T character by character. Make local decisions based on cost considerations: choose the cheapest operation (replacement, insertion-deletion pair, or swap) to align the characters.\\n- Optimization Heuristics: When possible, consider grouping similar operations to potentially reduce the total cost.
