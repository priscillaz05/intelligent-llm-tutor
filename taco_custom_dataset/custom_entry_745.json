Chef wants to insert N + 1 positive integers into this sequence and make it valid. A valid sequence is a sequence where every sign is preceded and followed by an integer, and the signs are correct. That is, if a sign '<' is preceded by the integer a and followed by an integer b, then a should be less than b. Likewise for the other two signs as well. \\nChef can take some positive integers in the range [1, P] and use a number in the range as many times as he wants.\\nHelp Chef find the minimum possible P with which he can create a valid sequence.\\n\\n-----Input-----\\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\\nThe only line of each test case contains the string of signs s, where each sign is either '<', '=' or a '>'. \\n\\n-----Output-----\\nFor each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the minimum possible P. \\n\\n-----Constraints-----\\n- 1 \u2264 T, |s| \u2264 105\\n- 1 \u2264 Sum of |s| over all test cases in a single test file \u2264 106\\n\\n-----Subtasks-----\\nSubtask #1 (30 points)\\n- 1 \u2264 T, |s| \u2264 103\\n- 1 \u2264 Sum of |s| over all test cases in a single test file \u2264 104\\n\\nSubtask #2 (70 points)\\n- Original constraints\\n\\n-----Example-----\\nInput:\\n4\\n<<<\\n<><\\n<=>\\n<=<\\n\\nOutput:\\n4\\n2\\n2\\n3\\n\\n-----Explanation-----\\nHere are some possible valid sequences which can be formed with the minimum P for each of the test cases:\\n1 < 2 < 3 < 4\\n1 < 2 > 1 < 2\\n1 < 2 = 2 > 1\\n1 < 2 = 2 < 3\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"t = int(input())\\nwhile t > 0:\\n\\ts = input()\\n\\ts = s.replace('=', '')\\n\\t(i, j, m) = (0, 0, 0)\\n\\twhile i < len(s):\\n\\t\\tj = i\\n\\t\\twhile j < len(s) and s[j] == s[i]:\\n\\t\\t\\tj += 1\\n\\t\\tm = max(m, j - i)\\n\\t\\ti = j\\n\\tprint(m + 1)\\n\\tt -= 1\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem asks to find the minimum possible value P such that we can insert N+1 integers from the range [1, P] into the string of signs 's' to make the sequence valid.\\n- Simplifying the Problem: The '=' sign implies that the adjacent numbers must be equal. These equal signs can be removed since they do not affect the minimum value of P. After removing them, we are only concerned with '<' and '>' signs.\\n- Finding the longest sequence of consecutive identical signs: Find the longest sequence of identical signs, because this will require the largest range of values for P. For example, if we have '<<<', we need at least the values 1, 2, 3, 4. If we have '<><', we only need the values 1 and 2.\\n- Handling Edge cases: Consider the empty string case. Should return 1 in this scenario.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does removing the '=' signs simplify the problem, and why is this step valid?\",\n    \"Why does the longest consecutive sequence of identical signs determine the minimum possible P?\",\n    \"How do we handle different signs like '<' and '>' in the string, and how do they impact the selection of P?\",\n    \"What if the input string 's' is empty? What should be the expected output in that scenario?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Removing '=' signs simplifies the problem by reducing it to finding the longest consecutive sequence of '<' or '>' signs.  This is valid because an '=' sign means the numbers before and after it are the same, so the minimum P isn't affected by them.\",\n    \"The longest consecutive sequence of identical signs determines the minimum P because for a sequence of n identical signs, you need n+1 distinct numbers.  Therefore, the largest such sequence determines the minimum range of numbers required.\",\n    \"Different signs such as '<' and '>' simply dictate the relationship between adjacent numbers. The specific values of the numbers within the range [1, P] depend on the longest consecutive repetition of the same sign. A sequence of alternating '<' and '>' only requires two distinct values.\",\n    \"If the input string 's' is empty, then there are no constraints imposed by signs. This means we only need one number to make the sequence valid, so the minimum possible P should be 1.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
