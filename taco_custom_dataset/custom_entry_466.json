When the range [A, B] includes a power of 2, many bits will likely become 0 in the final AND.\\n- Choosing an Algorithm: Develop a strategy to compute the bitwise AND efficiently, considering the constraints and potential patterns. The most significant bit determines the value; if numbers have differing most significant bits, the final answer is zero.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Ensure the code handles multiple test cases, parses input correctly, and outputs the result in the required format.\\n- Optimizing the Solution: Identify optimization strategies, such as checking if the most significant bits in A and B differ.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does the problem ask, and what mathematical operation is crucial to solve it?\",\n    \"What are some key characteristics of the bitwise AND operation, and how do they influence the outcome when applied to a range of numbers?\",\n    \"What edge cases should be considered, and how should the code handle them?\",\n    \"If A and B have different number of bits, what will be the AND value?\",\n    \"What optimization can be done to solve the problem faster?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The problem requires computing the bitwise AND of all natural numbers between two given integers A and B, inclusive.
