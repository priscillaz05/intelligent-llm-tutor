The boy wants to make sausage and cheese sandwiches, but first, he needs to buy a sausage and some cheese.\\n\\nThe town where Laurenty lives in is not large. The houses in it are located in two rows, n houses in each row. Laurenty lives in the very last house of the second row. The only shop in town is placed in the first house of the first row.\\n\\nThe first and second rows are separated with the main avenue of the city. The adjacent houses of one row are separated by streets.\\n\\nEach crosswalk of a street or an avenue has some traffic lights. In order to cross the street, you need to press a button on the traffic light, wait for a while for the green light and cross the street. Different traffic lights can have different waiting time.\\n\\nThe traffic light on the crosswalk from the j-th house of the i-th row to the (j + 1)-th house of the same row has waiting time equal to a_{ij} (1 \u2264 i \u2264 2, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n - 1). For the traffic light on the crossing from the j-th house of one row to the j-th house of another row the waiting time equals b_{j} (1 \u2264 j \u2264 n). The city doesn't have any other crossings.\\n\\nThe boy wants to get to the store, buy the products and go back. The main avenue of the city is wide enough, so the boy wants to cross it exactly once on the way to the store and exactly once on the way back home. The boy would get bored if he had to walk the same way again, so he wants the way home to be different from the way to the store in at least one crossing. [Image] Figure to the first sample. \\n\\nHelp Laurenty determine the minimum total time he needs to wait at the crossroads.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line of the input contains integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 50) \u2014 the number of houses in each row. \\n\\nEach of the next two lines contains n - 1 space-separated integer \u2014 values a_{ij} (1 \u2264 a_{ij} \u2264 100). \\n\\nThe last line contains n space-separated integers b_{j} (1 \u2264 j \u2264 100).\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the least total time Laurenty needs to wait at the crossroads, given that he crosses the avenue only once both on his way to the store and on his way back home.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n4\\n1 2 3\\n3 2 1\\n3 2 2 3\\n\\nOutput\\n12\\n\\nInput\\n3\\n1 2\\n3 3\\n2 1 3\\n\\nOutput\\n11\\n\\nInput\\n2\\n1\\n1\\n1 1\\n\\nOutput\\n4\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nThe first sample is shown on the figure above. \\n\\nIn the second sample, Laurenty's path can look as follows:   Laurenty crosses the avenue, the waiting time is 3;  Laurenty uses the second crossing in the first row, the waiting time is 2;  Laurenty uses the first crossing in the first row, the waiting time is 1;  Laurenty uses the first crossing in the first row, the waiting time is 1;  Laurenty crosses the avenue, the waiting time is 1;  Laurenty uses the second crossing in the second row, the waiting time is 3.  In total we get that the answer equals 11.\\n\\nIn the last sample Laurenty visits all the crossings, so the answer is 4.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"N = int(input())\\nx = [[0] * N, [0] * N]\\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\\nadash = [0]\\nfor i in range(N - 1):\\n\\tadash.append(adash[-1] + a[i])\\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\\nbdash = [0]\\nfor i in range(N - 1):\\n\\tbdash.append(bdash[-1] + b[i])\\nc = list(map(int, input().split()))\\nkachra = []\\nfor i in range(N):\\n\\tkachra.append(adash[i] + c[i] + bdash[-1] - bdash[i])\\nkachra.sort()\\nprint(kachra[0] + kachra[1])\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem describes a scenario where a boy needs to go from his house to a shop and back, crossing an avenue once in each direction. The goal is to minimize the total waiting time at traffic lights, ensuring the path back is different from the path to the store.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints: The boy must cross the avenue exactly once in each direction. The path back must be different from the path to the store. The objective is to minimize total waiting time.\\n- Devising a Strategy: Since the avenue must be crossed exactly once each way, calculate the cost of going to the store and back for each possible avenue crossing. Since the return path must be different, find the two cheapest total costs among all possible crossing points and sum them.\\n- Calculating Path Costs: Create cumulative sums for traffic light waiting times in both rows. The total cost for each avenue crossing is the sum of the costs to reach that crossing from the boy's house plus the cost to reach the store from that crossing plus the cost of crossing the avenue.\\n- Optimizing for Different Paths: Calculate the total cost for all possible crossings and find the two minimum total costs to ensure the round trip is optimized and unique.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you represent the waiting times at the traffic lights to make calculations easier?\",\n    \"How can you calculate the total waiting time for going to the store from the boy's house?\",\n    \"How can you calculate the total waiting time for coming back from the store to the boy's house?\",\n    \"How do you ensure the return path is different from the initial path?\",\n    \"How do you combine the waiting times for both trips to minimize the overall cost?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Represent the waiting times using arrays for the rows and the avenue crossings.

This ensures that the round trip is optimized and the paths are different.\",\n    \"Sum the two minimum total costs found for the round trip to get the minimized overall cost, ensuring each trip uses a different avenue crossing and minimizes waiting time.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
