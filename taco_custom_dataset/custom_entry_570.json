The rows are numbered $1$ through $N$ from top to bottom and the columns are numbered $1$ through $M$ from left to right.\\nAnas wants to destroy this grid.

Each hero destroys a cell and rests for K cells before destroying the next cell.\\n- Identifying Key Variables: N, M represent the dimensions of the grid. K varies from 0 to N*M - 1.  Row-major and column-major order define the path of each hero.\\n- Formulating the Algorithm: For each value of K, simulate the path of both heroes, keeping track of the cells destroyed by each. To avoid double counting, use a set to track destroyed cells. After simulating both heroes, the size of the set is the number of destroyed cells for that K.\\n- Optimizations: Since N and M can be up to 1000, a brute-force simulation for each K could be slow. It's important to optimize the simulation of each hero's path.\\n- Implementation Details: Convert 2D grid coordinates to 1D indices for easier calculations. Handle edge cases such as K=0 (all cells destroyed). Carefully track the current position of each hero and whether they destroy a cell at each step.\\n- Testing: Test with small N and M values (e.g., the example case) to verify the correctness of the algorithm.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you efficiently convert between 2D grid coordinates (row, col) and 1D indices for row-major and column-major order?\",\n    \"How can you simulate the destruction pattern of each hero for a given K, avoiding unnecessary calculations?\",\n    \"How do you avoid double-counting cells destroyed by both heroes?\",\n    \"What edge cases should you consider and how can you handle them?\",\n    \"Given N and M, how do you iterate through all possible values of K and store the results efficiently?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"For row-major order, the 1D index is row * M + col.  For column-major order, the 1D index is col * N + row.\",\n    \"For each hero, start at (0,0). Keep track of the hero's current 1D index. If (index % (K+1)) == 0, the cell at that index is destroyed. Otherwise, the hero rests. Increment the index in the correct order (row-major or column-major) until reaching N*M.\",\n    \"Use a set to store the indices of destroyed cells. When a hero destroys a cell, add its index to the set. The size of the set after both heroes have moved through the grid is the number of cells destroyed by at least one hero.\",\n    \"If K=0, all cells are destroyed, so the answer is N*M. Make sure the loop condition to stop the simulation for a hero is correct to avoid errors.\",\n    \"Iterate through K from 0 to N*M - 1. For each K, call a function that simulates both heroes, calculates the number of destroyed cells, and stores the result in a list. After the loop, print the list.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
