As the prison can't accommodate all of them, the city mayor has decided to transfer c of the prisoners to a prison located in another city.\\n\\nFor this reason, he made the n prisoners to stand in a line, with a number written on their chests. The number is the severity of the crime he/she has committed. The greater the number, the more severe his/her crime was.\\n\\nThen, the mayor told you to choose the c prisoners, who will be transferred to the other prison. He also imposed two conditions. They are,\\n\\n  The chosen c prisoners has to form a contiguous segment of prisoners.  Any of the chosen prisoner's crime level should not be greater then t. Because, that will make the prisoner a severe criminal and the mayor doesn't want to take the risk of his running away during the transfer. \\n\\nFind the number of ways you can choose the c prisoners.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line of input will contain three space separated integers n\\u00a0(1 \\u2264 n \\u2264 2\\\\cdot10^5), t\\u00a0(0 \\u2264 t \\u2264 10^9) and c\\u00a0(1 \\u2264 c \\u2264 n). The next line will contain n space separated integers, the i^{th} integer is the severity i^{th} prisoner's crime.

If the current element is <= t, increment the length. If it's > t, check if the current length is >= c, and update the count accordingly. Reset the length to 0. After iterating through the entire array, check one last time if a valid subarray exists at the end of the array.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you handle cases where the input array has fewer elements than c?\",\n    \"What data structure could be used to efficiently keep track of the contiguous segments of prisoners?\",\n    \"How would you optimize the solution for very large input arrays?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"If the number of prisoners, n, is less than c, then it is impossible to choose c prisoners to transfer. In that case the answer should be 0.\",\n    \"You can keep track of the current length of the contiguous segments of valid prisoners with a simple integer counter. No extra data structure is needed since you are looking for contiguous segments and their lengths.\",\n    \"Since the solution involves a single pass through the input array, the complexity is already O(n), making it difficult to reduce the time complexity further. However, error checking, using appropriate data types and avoiding redundant calculations can further optimize for very large input arrays.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
