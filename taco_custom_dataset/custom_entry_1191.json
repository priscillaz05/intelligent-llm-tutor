It then asks us to calculate the expected beauty of all valid BFS traversal orderings of a given tree rooted at node 1.\\n- BFS Traversal: Understanding that a BFS traversal starts at the root (node 1) and explores the neighbors level by level. The order within each level can vary, leading to different valid BFS sequences.\\n- Expected Beauty:  This involves calculating the beauty for each valid BFS sequence, summing them up, and dividing by the total number of valid BFS sequences.\\n- Tree Structure: The problem provides the tree structure as a set of edges, and the tree is rooted at node 1.\\n- Core Idea: The key idea is to realize that the number of possible BFS traversals can be large, so directly generating each BFS sequence and calculating its beauty is infeasible. Instead, we should focus on how the tree's structure and level-wise expansion affect the beauty value.  Nodes at different levels will always be processed in the order of their level, but nodes at same levels can be in any order.\\n- Utilizing Level Information: DFS is used to extract the level information of all nodes. Nodes on the same level can be in any order within BFS. For nodes i and j, if level[i] < level[j], then i will appear before j in any BFS ordering. Therefore, if i < j, val++ else val--.\\n- Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree) Usage: A Fenwick Tree is used to maintain the number of nodes seen so far. When processing a node at a particular level, it counts the number of previously seen nodes with a smaller index (contributing positively to the beauty) and the number of previously seen nodes with a larger index (contributing negatively to the beauty).\\n\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How is the 'beauty' of an array defined, and what does this definition imply about the relationship between elements in the array?\",\n    \"What are the key characteristics of a Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal, and how does it apply to a tree structure?\",\n    \"How can we efficiently represent and manage the tree structure given the input format (number of nodes and edges)?\",\n    \"Given the constraints, what is the most efficient method to generate all possible BFS orderings and calculate their beauty?\",\n    \"How do we account for the fact that nodes at the same level in the BFS can be visited in any order?\",\n    \"How can the Fenwick Tree be used to calculate the contributions to the total beauty value?\",\n    \"How would you verify if your solution is correct given that the answer has to be within a certain error tolerance?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The 'beauty' of an array is calculated by iterating through all pairs of elements. If a[i] < a[j], the beauty increases by 1; otherwise, it decreases by 1. This means that the relative order of the elements influences the beauty value.\",\n    \"BFS starts at the root node and explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.  In a tree rooted at node 1, BFS ensures we visit node 1 first, then its immediate children, then their children, and so on.\",\n    \"We can use an adjacency list to represent the tree where each index corresponds to a node, and the list at that index contains all the neighbors (adjacent nodes) of that node.\",\n    \"Generating all possible BFS orderings is computationally expensive. Instead, we should focus on calculating the expected beauty by leveraging the tree structure and statistical properties without explicitly generating each BFS ordering.\",\n    \"Nodes at the same level can be visited in any order, which means for each level, there are multiple valid BFS sequences. For each level, iterate through all nodes at this level, add the value to Fenwick tree, and accumulate positive and negative effect based on node index.\",\n    \"The Fenwick Tree helps to efficiently count how many nodes with smaller and larger indices have been seen before adding node to current level. Smaller index contributes positively to the overall beauty; Larger index contributes negatively. \",\n    \"Given that absolute or relative error tolerance is ${10}^{-6}$. Calculate a test using different cases (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, etc) and compare with expected results. The difference should be less than ${10}^{-6}$.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
