Understand the requirement to return the count modulo 10^9 + 7 due to potentially large counts.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Consider edge cases like an empty array or a sum of 0. Also, account for the need to use dynamic programming due to the problem constraints and the overlapping subproblems nature.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Choose dynamic programming to store and reuse solutions for subproblems. A 2D DP table can be utilized, where dp[i][j] stores the number of subsets of the first 'i' elements that sum up to 'j'.\\n- Implementing the Dynamic Programming Solution: Initialize the DP table correctly. The base case dp[0][0] = 1 represents an empty set summing to 0. Iterate through the array and the possible sums to fill the DP table, considering whether to include each element or not.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean to count subsets and what is the significance of the modulo operation?\",\n    \"How should you handle the base cases, especially when the target sum is 0 or the input array is empty?\",\n    \"Why is dynamic programming suitable for solving this problem, and how can it be applied to efficiently compute the number of subsets?\",\n    \"How do you decide whether to include or exclude the current element in the subset sum during the dynamic programming step?\",\n    \"What is the time and space complexity of the proposed solution, and how does it align with the given constraints?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Counting subsets means finding all possible combinations of elements from the array that add up to the target sum. The modulo operation is used to prevent integer overflow since the number of subsets can be very large, and we need to return the result modulo 10^9 + 7.\",\n    \"The base case when the target sum is 0 should return 1, representing the empty set. If the array is empty, the result is 0 if the sum is not 0, and 1 if the sum is 0 (empty set).\",\n    \"Dynamic programming is suitable because this problem exhibits overlapping subproblems (the number of subsets summing to a particular value can be built from smaller subproblems). A 2D DP table `dp[i][j]` stores the number of subsets of the first `i` elements that sum up to `j`.\",\n    \"When considering the current element `arr[i]`, we have two choices: either include it in the subset or exclude it. If we include it, we subtract `arr[i]` from the target sum `j` and look up the number of subsets for the remaining sum `j - arr[i]` using the previous elements. If we exclude it, we look up the number of subsets for the same target sum `j` using the previous elements.\",\n    \"The time complexity of the dynamic programming solution is O(N*sum), where N is the number of elements in the array and sum is the target sum. The space complexity is also O(N*sum) because we use a 2D DP table of size (N+1)*(sum+1). This aligns well with the constraint 1 \u2264 N*sum \u2264 10^{6}.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
