We all know that.\\n\\nA mind palace, according to Mr. Holmes is something that lets him retrieve a given memory in the least time posible. For this, he structures his mind palace in a very special way. Let a NxM Matrix denote the mind palace of Mr. Holmes. For fast retrieval he keeps each row and each column sorted. Now given a memory X, you have to tell the position of the memory in Sherlock's mind palace.\\n\\nInput\\nInput begins with a line containing space separated N and M.\\nThe next N lines each contain M numbers, each referring to a memory Y.\\nThe next line contains Q, the number of queries.\\nThe next Q lines contain a single element X, the memory you have to search in Sherlock's mind palace.\\n\\nOutput\\nIf Y is present in Mr. Holmes memory, output its position (0-based indexing).\\nElse output \\\"-1 -1\\\" (quotes for clarity only).\\n\\nConstraints\\n2 \u2264 N,M \u2264 1000\\n2 \u2264 Q \u2264 1000\\n-10^9 \u2264 X,Y \u2264 10^9\\n\\nNote : Large Input Files.

If X is found, output its row and column index; otherwise, output \\\"-1 -1\\\".\\n- Considering Optimization: Since the rows and columns are sorted, binary search is a possible approach for optimization. However, the provided solution does not seem to use binary search.\\n- Identifying Edge Cases: Handle cases where the matrix is empty, X is outside the range of values in the matrix, or X is not found.\\n- Implementing Basic Search: Iterate through the matrix row by row and check if X is present in the current row.  If found, return the row and column index. If not found after iterating through all rows, return \\\"-1 -1\\\".\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Given that the matrix rows and columns are sorted, how can you leverage this property to optimize the search for a specific memory?\",\n    \"What are the potential edge cases to consider when searching for a value in the mind palace?\",\n    \"Explain the steps you would take to implement a solution that iterates through the matrix and identifies the row and column of the memory, if it exists.\",\n    \"How would you handle the case where the memory is not present in the mind palace, and what output should be returned?\",\n    \"What input methods are expected and how does that impact the implementation of the solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Since the rows and columns are sorted, binary search can be used within each row to significantly reduce the search time.  Alternatively, a more advanced technique like a zig-zag search could be used which compares the target value to the top right element and then moves left or down based on whether the target is smaller or larger.\",\n    \"Edge cases include an empty matrix, a matrix where X is smaller than the smallest element or larger than the largest element, and the general case where X is not found in the matrix.\",\n    \"The solution involves iterating through each row of the matrix. For each row, it checks if the target value is present. If the value is found, the row index and the column index (obtained using the index method or similar) are returned.  If the value is not found after checking all rows, the function should return \\\"-1 -1\\\".\",\n    \"If the memory is not present in the mind palace after iterating through all rows, the output should be \\\"-1 -1\\\".\",\n    \"The code assumes standard input where the dimensions of the array, the elements, the number of queries and the search terms are given through the standard input stream.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
