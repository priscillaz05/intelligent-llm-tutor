Let (i, j) (1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq H, 1 \\\\leq j \\\\leq W) denote the square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left.\\n\\nAt time 0, one robot will be placed onto each square. Each robot is one of the following three types:\\n\\n* Type-H: Does not move at all.\\n* Type-R: If a robot of this type is in (i, j) at time t, it will be in (i, j+1) at time t+1. If it is in (i, W) at time t, however, it will be instead in (i, 1) at time t+1. (The robots do not collide with each other.)\\n* Type-D: If a robot of this type is in (i, j) at time t, it will be in (i+1, j) at time t+1. If it is in (H, j) at time t, however, it will be instead in (1, j) at time t+1.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are 3^{H \\\\times W} possible ways to place these robots.

The task is to count the number of initial placements such that after multiples of time T, each cell is occupied. Need to compute the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.\\n- Identifying Key Mathematical Properties: The key insight is that the problem relates to the greatest common divisor (GCD). The movements of the robots can be analyzed in terms of cycles. The number of placements for which the condition holds depends on the GCD of H and T, and W and T.\\n- Selecting Algorithmic Strategy: First calculate gcd(H, T) and gcd(W, T). Let h = gcd(H, T) and w = gcd(W, T). Divide H by h and W by w. Then compute ans = pow(2, H, mod) + pow(2, W, mod) + pow(2, gcd(H, W), mod) - 3. Finally, compute pow(ans, h * w, mod). Also the GCD function is needed.\\n- Implementing the Solution: Implement the GCD function. Read H, W, and T from input. Set mod = 10^9 + 7. Compute h = gcd(H, T) and w = gcd(W, T). Update H and W. Calculate ans = (2^H + 2^W + 2^gcd(H, W) - 3) mod (10^9 + 7). Output ans^(h * w) mod (10^9 + 7).\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the core requirement for the robots to satisfy the condition at times 0, T, 2T, and so on?\",\n    \"How does the GCD relate to the cyclic movements of the robots in the grid?\",\n    \"Why is the modulo operation necessary, and how does it affect the calculation?\",\n    \"What edge cases or special scenarios should be considered in this problem?\",\n    \"Can you explain the mathematical reasoning behind the given formula for 'ans'?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Every square must be occupied by one robot at all multiples of time T, implying a stable configuration in terms of occupancy.\",\n    \"The GCD represents the size of the cycles created by the robots' movements. It determines the number of robots that return to their initial position after a certain time.\",\n    \"The modulo operation is used to prevent integer overflow because the counts can be very large. It ensures the result stays within the specified range.\",\n    \"Cases where H, W, or T are equal to 1 should be carefully considered as these will impact the cycles. Also edge cases for the GCD calculation.\",\n    \"The formula likely accounts for the number of ways to configure the robot placements based on the cycles generated by H, W, and their GCD, ensuring each cell is occupied at multiples of time T, while subtracting overlaps and ensuring that the initial state is maintained.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
