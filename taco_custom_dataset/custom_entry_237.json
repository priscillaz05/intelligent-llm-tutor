Sometimes it leads to interesting problems. \\n\\nLet's suppose that your task is to build a square city. The world map uses the Cartesian coordinates. The sides of the city should be parallel to coordinate axes. The map contains mines with valuable resources, located at some points with integer coordinates. The sizes of mines are relatively small, i.e. they can be treated as points. The city should be built in such a way that all the mines are inside or on the border of the city square. \\n\\nBuilding a city takes large amount of money depending on the size of the city, so you have to build the city with the minimum area. Given the positions of the mines find the minimum possible area of the city.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line of the input contains number n\\u00a0\\u2014 the number of mines on the map (2 \\u2264 n \\u2264 1000). Each of the next n lines contains a pair of integers x_{i} and y_{i}\\u00a0\\u2014 the coordinates of the corresponding mine ( - 10^9 \\u2264 x_{i}, y_{i} \\u2264 10^9). All points are pairwise distinct.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nPrint the minimum area of the city that can cover all the mines with valuable resources.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n2\\n0 0\\n2 2\\n\\nOutput\\n4\\n\\nInput\\n2\\n0 0\\n0 3\\n\\nOutput\\n9\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"n = int(input())\\nlis = []\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\tlis.append(input().split())\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\tfor j in range(2):\\n\\t\\tlis[i][j] = int(lis[i][j])\\nlis0 = []\\nlis1 = []\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\tlis0.append(lis[i][0])\\n\\tlis1.append(lis[i][1])\\nif n == 1:\\n\\tprint(1)\\nelse:\\n\\tm = max(max(lis0) - min(lis0), max(lis1) - min(lis1))\\n\\tprint(m ** 2)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding Problem Constraints: The problem asks for the minimum area of a square city that encloses all given mine coordinates. The city's sides must be parallel to the coordinate axes.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Recognize that simply calculating the area based on the range of x and y coordinates independently may not result in a square. The side length of the square must be sufficient to cover both the x and y ranges.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Find the minimum and maximum x coordinates and the minimum and maximum y coordinates. The side length of the square city will be the maximum of the range of x coordinates and the range of y coordinates. The area will be the square of this side length.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Read the input coordinates, find the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates, calculate the necessary side length, and compute the area.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you determine the minimum x and y coordinates and the maximum x and y coordinates from the given input?\",\n    \"How do you use the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates to determine the necessary side length of the square city?\",\n    \"Why do you need to take the maximum of the x and y coordinate ranges to determine the side length of the square?\",\n    \"What data types should be used to handle the input coordinates and area, given that the coordinates can be large?\",\n    \"Are there any edge cases to consider, such as when only one mine is present?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Iterate through all the mine coordinates, keeping track of the minimum and maximum x and y values encountered so far.\",\n    \"Calculate the range of x coordinates (max_x - min_x) and the range of y coordinates (max_y - min_y). The side length is the maximum of these two ranges.\",\n    \"The side length of the square must be large enough to cover both the x and y ranges. Taking the maximum ensures that the square encompasses all the mines.\",\n    \"Integers should be used for coordinates. Since the maximum value of x, y can be 10^9, the difference of max and min can be as high as 2 * 10^9, and squaring that to calculate the area can cause overflow if 32-bit integers are used, therefore 64-bit integers should be used to represent the area.\",\n    \"If there is only one mine, the side length of the city can be 0, and the area will be 0.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
