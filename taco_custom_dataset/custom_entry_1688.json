All the bikers want to participate in the HackerRace competition, but unfortunately only K bikers can be accommodated in the race. Jack is organizing the HackerRace and wants to start the race as soon as possible. He can instruct any biker to move towards any bike in the city. In order to minimize the time to start the race, Jack instructs the bikers in such a way that the first K bikes are acquired in the minimum time.\\n\\nEvery biker moves with a unit speed and one bike can be acquired by only one biker. A biker can proceed in any direction. Consider distance between bikes and bikers as Euclidean distance.\\n\\nJack would like to know the square of required time to start the race as soon as possible. \\n\\nInput Format\\nThe first line contains three integers, N, M, and K, separated by a single space. \\nThe following N lines will contain N pairs of integers denoting the co-ordinates of N bikers. Each pair of integers is separated by a single space. The next M lines will similarly denote the co-ordinates of the M bikes.\\n\\nOutput Format\\n\\nA single line containing the square of required time.\\n\\nConstraints\\n\\n1\u2264N\u2264250\\n\\n1\u2264M\u2264250\\n\\n1\u2264K\u2264min(N,M)\\n\\n0\u2264xi, yi \u2264107\\n\\nSAMPLE INPUT\\n3 3 2\\n0 1\\n0 2\\n0 3\\n100 1\\n200 2 \\n300 3\\n\\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\\n40000\\n\\nExplanation\\n\\nThere's need for two bikers for the race. The first biker (0,1) will be able to reach the first bike (100,1) in 100 time units. The second biker (0,2) will be able to reach the second bike (200,2) in 200 time units. This is the most optimal solution and will take 200 time units. So output will be 2002 = 40000.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"'''\\n# Read input from stdin and provide input before running code\\n\\nname = raw_input('What is your name?\\\\n')\\nprint 'Hi, %s.' % name\\n'''\\nfrom sys import stdin\\nimport math\\nfrom operator import indexOf\\n    \\ndef dist(a,b):\\n\\treturn (((a[0]-b[0])*(a[0]-b[0])+((a[1]-b[1])*(a[1]-b[1]))))\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  \\ndef main():\\n\\tN,M,K = list(map(int, stdin.readline().split()))\\n\\tbikers = []\\n\\tbikes = []\\n\\tfor i in range(N):\\n\\t\\tbikers.append(list(map(int, stdin.readline().split())))\\n\\tfor i in range(M):\\n\\t\\tbikes.append(list(map(int, stdin.readline().split())))        \\n\\t\\t\\n\\tdistanceArr =[]\\n\\tfor i in range(len(bikers)):\\n\\t\\tdistances ={}\\n\\t\\tfor j in range(len(bikes)):\\n\\t\\t\\tdistances[j] = dist(bikers[i], bikes[j])\\n\\t\\tdistanceArr.append(distances)\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tfor i in range(K):\\n\\t\\tlenArr = len(distanceArr)\\n\\t\\tminArr = [0]*lenArr\\n\\t\\tfor j in range(lenArr):\\n\\t\\t\\tminArr[j] = min(distanceArr[j].values())\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\tresult = min(minArr)\\n\\t\\tind = indexOf(minArr,result)\\n\\t\\t#print \\\"index : \\\"+str(ind)\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\tk = [x for x in distanceArr[ind] if distanceArr[ind][x] == result]\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t#print k[0]\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\tdel distanceArr[ind]\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\tfor h in range(lenArr-1):\\n\\t\\t\\tdel distanceArr[h][k[0]]\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\n\\tprint(result)\\n\\t\\nmain()\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem is an assignment problem where we need to assign K bikers to K bikes such that the maximum time taken by any biker to reach the assigned bike is minimized.  We are given the coordinates of N bikers and M bikes. The distance is Euclidean.\\n- Identifying potential constraints and edge cases: The number of bikers and bikes could be different.  We only need to consider K bikers and bikes. The coordinates are integers. \\n- Selecting an algorithmic strategy: We can use binary search on the possible range of squared distances to find the minimum required time. The check function for binary search involves solving a bipartite matching problem. We need to find if K bikers can reach K bikes within the given squared distance.\\n- Hungarian Algorithm/ Max Flow: Inside the check function, we can use either the Hungarian algorithm or max flow to solve the bipartite matching. Hungarian is more efficient for smaller constraints.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Efficiently calculate distances.  Correctly implement bipartite matching.\\n- Optimizing the check function: Try to avoid unnecessary calculations in the check function. The range of binary search can also be optimized.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the range of possible distances that needs to be considered in binary search?\",\n    \"How can the bipartite matching be implemented efficiently to check if K bikers can be assigned bikes within a specific distance?\",\n    \"What are the space and time complexities of the chosen algorithm, and what optimizations can be applied?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The range of possible squared distances is from 0 to the square of the maximum possible Euclidean distance between any biker and bike. Given the constraints on coordinates (0 to 10^7), the maximum distance can be 2 * 10^7, so the maximum squared distance is (2 * 10^7)^2 = 4 * 10^14.  Therefore, the range is [0, 4 * 10^14].\",\n    \"Bipartite matching can be efficiently implemented using either the Hungarian algorithm or the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm (max flow). Hungarian is often preferred for these constraints. The adjacency matrix represents which bikers can reach which bikes within the given distance limit in binary search.  Use DFS or BFS to find augmenting paths to maximize the matching size.\",\n    \"The dominant part of the time complexity comes from the binary search and bipartite matching. Binary search is O(log(4*10^14)).  Hungarian algorithm takes O(N^3) where N is the number of bikers/bikes.  Therefore, the overall complexity is O(N^3 * log(4*10^14)). Space complexity is dominated by adjacency matrix O(N*M). Optimization might include reducing the number of distance calculations and early termination if a perfect matching is found before completing the Hungarian algorithm.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
