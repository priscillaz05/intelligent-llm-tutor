After seeing the advertisement, many candidates have applied for the job. Now chef wants to shortlist people for the interviews, so he gave all of them one problem which they must solve in order to get shortlisted.\\n\\nThe problem was : For a given positive integer N, what is the maximum sum of distinct numbers such that the Least Common Multiple of all these numbers is N.  \\n\\nYour friend Rupsa also applied for the job, but was unable to solve this problem and hence you've decided to help her out by writing a code for solving this problem.\\n\\n------ Input ------ \\n\\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.        \\nEach test case contains a single integer N.\\n\\n------ Output ------ \\n\\nFor each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the answer for that test case.\\n\\n------ Constraints ------ \\n\\n$1 \u2264 T \u2264 1000$\\n$1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^{9}$\\n\\nSubtask 1 (30 points):\\n\\n$1 \u2264 T \u2264 100$\\n$1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^{5}$\\n\\nSubtask 2 (70 points):\\n\\n$original constraints$\\n\\n----- Sample Input 1 ------ \\n2\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n----- Sample Output 1 ------ \\n1\\n\\n3\\n----- explanation 1 ------ \\nExample 1 : Only possible number is 1, so the maximum sum of distinct numbers is exactly 1. \\nExample 2 : The distinct numbers you can have are just 1 and 2, so the sum is 3.

Recognize that directly computing LCM for all possible sets of numbers would be computationally expensive.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Consider that the distinct numbers must be factors of N. Realize that finding all factors of N and summing them will yield the correct result, since the LCM of all factors will be N.\\n- Optimizing Factor Finding: Instead of iterating from 1 to N, iterate from 1 to the square root of N to find factors efficiently. When a factor 'i' is found, also consider 'N/i' as a factor, unless 'i' is equal to 'N/i'.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of a set of numbers to be equal to N?\",\n    \"If the LCM of the numbers is N, what can you say about the relationship between the numbers and N?\",\n    \"How would you efficiently find all the numbers that could potentially be part of the sum, given the constraint on N?\",\n    \"Why is it sufficient to consider only the factors of N when determining the distinct numbers for the sum?\",\n    \"Given that you are iterating up to the square root of N to find factors, how do you handle the case where N is a perfect square?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"It means that N is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by all the numbers in the set.\",\n    \"The numbers must all be factors (divisors) of N.  If any number was not a factor of N, the LCM of the set would be greater than N.\",\n    \"Iterate from 1 to the square root of N. For each number 'i' that divides N, both 'i' and 'N/i' are factors of N.\",\n    \"Because if any number is not a factor of N, then N cannot be the LCM of the numbers.  The numbers must divide N evenly to have N as their LCM.\",\n    \"When N is a perfect square, the square root of N is a factor that, when N is divided by it, results in the same number. You should only add this factor to the sum once to maintain distinctness.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
