The positions of the black king, white king, and the other white piece are given as input.\\n- Parsing Input: Parse the input strings to extract the coordinates of each piece on the chessboard. Convert chess notation (e.g., 'a1') to numerical coordinates (e.g., (1, 1)).\\n- Determining Check Condition for Each Piece: Implement the check logic for each type of piece:\\n  - Rook: Checks if the black king and the rook share the same row or column and no other piece obstructs the path.\\n  - Bishop: Checks if the black king and the bishop are on the same diagonal and the white king does not obstruct the path.\\n  - Knight: Checks if the black king is within a knight's move distance.\\n  - Queen: Combines the check conditions of the rook and the bishop.\\n- Obstruction Check: It's crucial to implement the obstruction check such that the white king is not between the attacking white piece and the black king. We use the distance from the attacking white piece to the black king and compare it to the white king to the black king.\\n- Combining Conditions: Check if any of the check conditions for each piece type are met. If none are met print '-1', otherwise print 'check'.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you convert the chess notation (e.g., 'a1') to numerical coordinates that can be used for calculations?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the distance between two pieces on the chessboard given their coordinates?\",\n    \"How do you determine if a rook is attacking the black king given their positions?\",\n    \"How do you determine if a bishop is attacking the black king given their positions?\",\n    \"How do you determine if a knight is attacking the black king given their positions?\",\n    \"How does the white king impact the check condition? How do you make sure that the white king is not obstructing the check?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"You can map the letters 'a' to 'h' to the numbers 1 to 8 and then use the number directly from the second character of the chess notation.\",\n    \"The distance between two pieces (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) can be calculated using the Euclidean distance formula: sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2).  However, for rook, bishop and queen a straight line path must exist, and for knight we must ensure that the sum of absolute differences is equal to 3 and that no single move is larger than 2 steps in one axis and 1 step in the other.\",\n    \"A rook attacks the black king if they share the same row or column.  This means either their x-coordinates are the same or their y-coordinates are the same. Additionally, the white king can't be on the path.\",\n    \"A bishop attacks the black king if they are on the same diagonal. This means the absolute difference between their x-coordinates is equal to the absolute difference between their y-coordinates. Additionally, the white king can't be on the path.\",\n    \"A knight attacks the black king if it can reach the king in a single knight's move. This means the king is either 2 steps horizontally and 1 step vertically away, or 2 steps vertically and 1 step horizontally away.\",\n    \"The white king's position is important for determining if the black king is checked.  We need to calculate the distances between all the pieces, and if the white king is closer to the attacking white piece than the black king is, then the black king is not under check. The shortest path must be direct, without any obstruction.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
