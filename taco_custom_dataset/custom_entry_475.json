Whenever a customer comes to buy laddus, chef follows a rule that each customer must buy all laddus on odd position.

The goal is to find the original position of the last laddu.\\n- Identifying Key Insight: The number of laddus is reduced in each step by roughly half. The process continues until we have a power of 2. Then the position of the last laddu is that power of 2. More precisely, find the largest power of 2 that is <= K.\\n- Selecting an Algorithm: Iterate and double a number `num` until it's greater than or equal to K. If num == K, then the answer is num. Otherwise, the answer is num/2.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Handle the base case where K = 1 separately. Use integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point errors.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does the number of laddus change with each customer's selection, and how does this impact the position of the last remaining laddu?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently determine the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to a given number K?\",\n    \"What are the key edge cases or base cases that need to be considered in the problem, and how do they affect the algorithm?\",\n    \"Can you explain the logic behind finding the last remaining laddu, and how the repeated selection from odd positions simplifies to finding a power of 2?\",\n    \"If K is not a power of 2, what value does the problem asks us to print?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Each customer selects laddus at odd positions, effectively reducing the number of laddus roughly by half in each step. This converges toward a power of 2, which ultimately determines the final position of the last laddu.\",\n    \"Iteratively multiply by 2 until exceeding the given number K. The last number before exceeding K is the required largest power of 2.\",\n    \"The primary edge case is when K = 1, in which case the position of the last laddu is 1. If the number is a power of 2 then the position is the number itself.\",\n    \"The process reduces the number of laddus in such a way that the last laddu's position corresponds to the largest power of 2 that's less than or equal to the initial number of laddus K. It is because we repeatedly divide by 2.\",\n    \"If K is not a power of 2, then we print the largest power of 2 that is <= K\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
