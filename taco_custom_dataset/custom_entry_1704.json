It is possible that some cards have the same integers on them.\\n\\nVasily decided to sort the cards. To do this, he repeatedly takes the top card from the deck, and if the number on it equals the minimum number written on the cards in the deck, then he places the card away. Otherwise, he puts it under the deck and takes the next card from the top, and so on. The process ends as soon as there are no cards in the deck. You can assume that Vasily always knows the minimum number written on some card in the remaining deck, but doesn't know where this card (or these cards) is.\\n\\nYou are to determine the total number of times Vasily takes the top card from the deck.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000) \u2014 the number of cards in the deck.\\n\\nThe second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 100 000), where a_{i} is the number written on the i-th from top card in the deck.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nPrint the total number of times Vasily takes the top card from the deck.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n4\\n6 3 1 2\\n\\nOutput\\n7\\n\\nInput\\n1\\n1000\\n\\nOutput\\n1\\n\\nInput\\n7\\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3\\n\\nOutput\\n7\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first example Vasily at first looks at the card with number 6 on it, puts it under the deck, then on the card with number 3, puts it under the deck, and then on the card with number 1. He places away the card with 1, because the number written on it is the minimum among the remaining cards. After that the cards from top to bottom are [2, 6, 3]. Then Vasily looks at the top card with number 2 and puts it away. After that the cards from top to bottom are [6, 3]. Then Vasily looks at card 6, puts it under the deck, then at card 3 and puts it away. Then there is only one card with number 6 on it, and Vasily looks at it and puts it away. Thus, in total Vasily looks at 7 cards.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"from collections import deque\\nimport heapq\\nn = int(input())\\ncards_help = list(map(int, input().split()))\\ncards = [(cards_help[i], -1 * i) for i in range(n)]\\nheapq.heapify(cards)\\ndraws = 0\\nremoved = 0\\nwhile cards:\\n\\tprev = -1\\n\\tnew_removals = 0\\n\\tcurrent = cards[0]\\n\\twhile cards and -1 * current[1] > prev:\\n\\t\\tnew_removals += 1\\n\\t\\theapq.heappop(cards)\\n\\t\\ttemp_prev = -1 * current[1]\\n\\t\\twhile cards and cards[0][0] == current[0] and (-1 * cards[0][1] > prev):\\n\\t\\t\\tcurrent = cards[0]\\n\\t\\t\\theapq.heappop(cards)\\n\\t\\t\\tnew_removals += 1\\n\\t\\tprev = temp_prev\\n\\t\\tcurrent = cards[0] if cards else 0\\n\\tdraws += n - removed\\n\\tremoved += new_removals\\nprint(draws)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem Requirements: Parse the problem statement to understand Vasily's card sorting process. Grasp the conditions for removing a card from the deck versus placing it at the bottom.\\n- Data Structures Considerations: Decide on suitable data structures to represent the deck of cards and to efficiently track the minimum card value. Consider using a list or deque for the deck and a min-heap for finding minimum values.\\n- Algorithm for Simulation: Simulate the card sorting process step by step. Track the number of times Vasily takes a card. Properly manage the deck by removing cards or moving them to the bottom based on the minimum value criteria.\\n- Optimizations and Efficiency: Consider approaches to optimize the process of finding minimums, perhaps pre-calculating or dynamically updating minimum values. Think about how to handle multiple cards with the same minimum value efficiently.\\n- Termination Condition: Determine when the simulation should terminate (when the deck is empty).

A deque allows efficient removal from the front and addition to the back, which aligns with the problem description. Lists are also possible, but may involve shifting elements more frequently.\",\n    \"The minimum value can be tracked using a min-heap. Initially, all cards can be added to the heap, allowing for O(log n) retrieval of the minimum value. The complexity for heapifying the initial list is O(n), and subsequent removals are O(log n).\",\n    \"Simulation steps: (1) Take the top card. (2) Check if the card's value equals the minimum value in the deck (obtainable from the min-heap). (3) If it is the minimum, remove it from both the deck and the heap and increment the count. (4) If it is not the minimum, move the card to the bottom of the deck.\",\n    \"If multiple cards have the same minimum value, they should all be removed in the order they appear at the top of the deck as long as they are the minimum. This requires checking for cards of the same value after identifying the initial minimum. A while loop can be used to iterate through these cards.\",\n    \"Optimizations may include: (1) Efficiently updating the min-heap after removals. (2) Avoiding redundant calculations of the minimum if possible. (3) Using appropriate data structures to minimize the time complexity of deck operations. Pre-calculating the minimum for each cycle could reduce redundant heap operations.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
