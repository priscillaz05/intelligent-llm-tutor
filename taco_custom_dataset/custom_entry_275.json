Then, remembering that there was a piece of paper with the password written down, Taro found the paper and was surprised to see it. The paper was cut and there were only fragments, and there were some stains that made it unreadable. Taro decided to guess the password by referring to the memo.\\n\\nConstraints\\n\\n* The length of the character strings A and B is 1 to 1000 characters.\\n* The length of the B string does not exceed the length of the A string.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nString A\\nString B\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nOutput \\\"Yes\\\" or \\\"No\\\" on one line.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nInput\\n\\nABCDE\\nABC\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nYes\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\nKUSATSU\\nKSATSU\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nNo\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\nABCABC\\nACBA_B\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nNo\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\nRUPCUAPC\\n__PC\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nYes\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\nAIZU\\n_A\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nNo\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"a = input()\\nb = input()\\nlength_a = len(a)\\nlength_b = len(b)\\n\\ndef check():\\n\\tfor i in range(length_a - length_b + 1):\\n\\t\\tfor j in range(length_b):\\n\\t\\t\\tif b[j] == '_' or a[i + j] == b[j]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontinue\\n\\t\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tprint('Yes')\\n\\t\\t\\treturn\\n\\tprint('No')\\n\\treturn\\ncheck()\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding Problem Requirements: Recognize that string B needs to be checked whether it can be a substring of string A with some characters of B replaced by '_'. Understand the constraints on the lengths of the strings A and B.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: The core challenge is to implement the logic that allows `_` characters in string B to match any characters in string A, while other characters in B must match exactly with the corresponding characters in A.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Iterate through string A considering all possible starting positions for string B. For each position, compare each character of string B with the corresponding character of string A, allowing '_' to match any character. If any non-'_' character in B doesn't match, move to the next starting position of B in A.\\n- Implementing the comparison and output: If a matching substring is found, print 'Yes' and exit. If no match is found after trying all positions, print 'No'.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does the presence of '_' in string B affect the comparison with string A, and how does your code handle it?\",\n    \"How do you handle the situation where string B is longer than string A, which violates the problem constraint?\",\n    \"How can you ensure that the program outputs the correct result efficiently, even when the strings A and B are very long (up to 1000 characters)?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The character '_' in string B is treated as a wildcard that can match any character in string A. The code should skip the comparison when it encounters a '_' and proceed to the next character.\",\n    \"The problem states that the length of B cannot exceed the length of A. If B is longer than A, the program should return immediately as 'No' because string B cannot be a substring of string A.\",\n    \"To ensure efficiency, the code should stop searching and output 'Yes' as soon as it finds a matching substring. Also, avoiding unnecessary comparisons and using optimized string operations would help.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
