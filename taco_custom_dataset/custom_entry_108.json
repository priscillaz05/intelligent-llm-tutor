"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"Born a misinterpretation of [this kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/simple-fun-number-334-two-beggars-and-gold/), your task here is pretty simple: given an array of values and an amount of beggars, you are supposed to return an array with the sum of what each beggar brings home, assuming they all take regular turns, from the first to the last.\\n\\nFor example: `[1,2,3,4,5]` for `2` beggars will return a result of `[9,6]`, as the first one takes `[1,3,5]`, the second collects `[2,4]`.\\n\\nThe same array with `3` beggars would have in turn have produced a better out come for the second beggar: `[5,7,3]`, as they will respectively take `[1,4]`, `[2,5]` and `[3]`.\\n\\nAlso note that not all beggars have to take the same amount of \\\"offers\\\", meaning that the length of the array is not necessarily a multiple of `n`; length can be even shorter, in which case the last beggars will of course take nothing (`0`).\\n\\n***Note:*** in case you don't get why this kata is about *English* beggars, then you are not familiar on how religiously queues are taken in the kingdom ;)\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def beggars(values, n):\\n\\treturn [sum(values[i::n]) for i in range(n)]\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem Requirements: The problem requires distributing an array of values among a specified number of beggars. Each beggar takes turns in a round-robin fashion. The goal is to return an array where each element represents the total sum each beggar accumulates.\\n- Handling Uneven Distribution: Consider cases where the length of the array isn't a multiple of the number of beggars. Some beggars might receive fewer or no values. Handle cases when the array is shorter than the number of beggars.\\n- Choosing an Algorithmic Strategy: A list comprehension can be used to iterate through the beggars. For each beggar, the code needs to collect all values assigned to them by skipping `n` positions in the input array. Then, it must sum those values.\\n- Edge Cases: Handle cases when the number of beggars is zero. If so, the function should return an array of zeros.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Properly calculate the slices to assign to each beggar, ensuring all values are correctly distributed.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How should I handle edge cases where the number of beggars is zero or negative? What should be returned in these scenarios?\",\n    \"How can I efficiently assign values to beggars based on their turn, especially if the array length is not a multiple of the number of beggars?\",\n    \"What data structure should I use to store the total amount each beggar has accumulated, and how would I initialize it?\",\n    \"How do you handle the case when the array of values is empty?\",\n    \"How would you adjust your algorithm if the beggars were to take turns in reverse order?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"If the number of beggars is zero or negative, an empty list should be returned since there's no one to collect any values.\",\n    \"I can use slicing with a step of `n` (the number of beggars) to select the values for each beggar. The starting index of the slice will represent each beggar's starting position.\",\n    \"A list of integers can be used, initialized with zeros, where the index represents the beggar's number, and the value represents the total sum they have accumulated.\",\n    \"If the array of values is empty, each beggar will have a sum of 0, so return a list of zeros with the length equal to the number of beggars.\",\n    \"If beggars were to take turns in reverse order, the indices for the list comprehension needs to be adjusted to ensure elements are being grabbed in reverse (ie `n-i-1` instead of `i`).\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
