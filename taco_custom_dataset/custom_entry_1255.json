The auditorium was filled with males (M) and females (F), occupying one chair each. Our Chef is very curious guy, so he asks the gatekeeper some queries. The queries were as follows: Is there any K*K sub-matrix in the auditorium which contains all Males or Females.\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n- The first line contains three space-separated integers L, R  and Q describing the dimension of the auditorium and the number of questions Chef will ask.\\n- Each of next L lines contains R characters (M or F).\\n- Next Q lines contains K and a character (M or F).\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n- For each query output \\\"yes\\\" (without quotes) if there exist any K*K sub-matrix in the auditorium which contains all Males (if he asks about Male) or Females (if he asks about Female), otherwise output \\\"no\\\" (without quotes).\\n\\n-----Constraints and Subtasks-----\\n- 1 <= L, R, K <= 1000\\n- 1 <= Q <= 1e6\\nSubtask 1: 30 points\\n- 1 <= L, R, Q <= 200\\nSubtask 2: 70 points\\n- Original Contraints\\n\\n-----Example-----\\nInput:\\n4 3 3\\nMMF\\nMMM\\nFFM\\nFFM\\n2 F\\n3 M\\n1 M\\n\\nOutput:\\nyes\\nno\\nyes\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def matrix(L, row, col, c):\\n\\td = {}\\n\\tdp = []\\n\\tfor i in range(row + 1):\\n\\t\\ttemp = []\\n\\t\\tfor i in range(col + 1):\\n\\t\\t\\ttemp.append([])\\n\\t\\tdp.append(temp)\\n\\tfor i in range(row + 1):\\n\\t\\tdp[i][0] = 0\\n\\tfor i in range(col + 1):\\n\\t\\tdp[0][i] = 0\\n\\tfor i in range(1, row + 1):\\n\\t\\tfor j in range(1, col + 1):\\n\\t\\t\\tif L[i - 1][j - 1] == c:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - 1]) + 1\\n\\t\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdp[i][j] = 0\\n\\t\\t\\td[dp[i][j]] = d.get(dp[i][j], 0) + 1\\n\\treturn d\\nfrom sys import stdin\\n(n, m, q) = list(map(int, stdin.readline().split()))\\nL = []\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\tL.append(stdin.readline().strip())\\nmale = matrix(L, n, m, 'M')\\nfemale = matrix(L, n, m, 'F')\\nfor i in range(q):\\n\\tquery = stdin.readline().split()\\n\\tif query[1] == 'F':\\n\\t\\tif female.get(int(query[0]), 0) == 0:\\n\\t\\t\\tprint('no')\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tprint('yes')\\n\\telif male.get(int(query[0]), 0) == 0:\\n\\t\\tprint('no')\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tprint('yes')\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the problem: The problem requires checking for the existence of a K*K submatrix within a larger L*R matrix, where all elements within the submatrix are either all 'M' or all 'F'. We need to answer multiple queries related to different values of K and different genders.\\n- Choosing an algorithmic strategy: A dynamic programming approach can be employed to efficiently determine the largest square submatrix ending at each cell that contains only 'M' or only 'F'. This can be done in O(L*R) time. Then, for each query, we check if a submatrix of size K*K exists by checking if largest possible square submatrix at any cell is atleast of size K.\\n- Implementing the DP approach: Create two DP tables, one for 'M' and one for 'F'. dp_M[i][j] stores the size of the largest square submatrix ending at (i, j) containing only 'M's, and similarly for dp_F[i][j].\\n- Handling multiple queries efficiently: After computing the DP tables, we can answer each query in O(1) time by looking up if size K exists in the DP matrix results.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you efficiently check for the existence of a K*K sub-matrix of all 'M's or all 'F's within the larger matrix?\",\n    \"What is the time complexity of building the necessary data structures, and how does it scale with L, R, and Q?\",\n    \"How does the dynamic programming approach help in answering the queries efficiently?\",\n    \"How can you optimize the solution to meet the constraint of Q <= 1e6?\",\n    \"How does the get method in a dictionary function?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A dynamic programming approach can be used to build a table indicating the size of the largest square sub-matrix ending at each cell that contains only 'M's or only 'F's. Then, for each query, you check if there exists a K*K sub-matrix.\",\n    \"The time complexity of building the DP tables is O(L*R). Each query can be answered in O(1). Therefore the overall complexity is O(L*R + Q).\",\n    \"The DP approach allows us to precompute the maximum size of square sub-matrices ending at each cell. Then answering a query only requires checking if maximum size is atleast of size K.\",\n    \"The provided solution uses a O(L*R) approach to precompute the data and answers each of the Q queries in O(1) time which efficiently addresses the constraint Q <= 1e6.\",\n    \"The get method in a dictionary in Python returns the value for the given key if the key is in the dictionary.
