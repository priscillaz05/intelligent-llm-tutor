This involves checking each element: if it matches the target value, return `True`; if it's a list itself, recursively call the function to search within that sublist.\\n- Base Case: The base case for the recursion is when the value is found or when the sequence is exhausted without finding the value.\\n- Data Type Handling: Ensure proper handling of different data types within the sequence, particularly distinguishing between individual values and nested lists.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What strategy might you consider to traverse through the potentially nested list structure?\",\n    \"How would you determine when to stop searching and return either `True` or `False`?\",\n    \"How can you handle the different data types within the sequence, specifically distinguishing between individual values and nested lists?\",\n    \"What is the base case for the recursion?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A recursive approach would be suitable for traversing the structure, as it allows for handling nested lists within the main sequence effectively.\",\n    \"I would stop searching and return `True` if the value is found during the traversal or `False` if the entire sequence and all nested lists are searched without finding the value.\",\n    \"I can use the `isinstance()` function to check if an element is a list.
