The insert() function is responsible for placing an element at its correct sorted position within a sub-array. The insertionSort() function iterates through the array and uses insert() to build the sorted portion of the array one element at a time.\\n- Identifying the Core Algorithm: Insertion sort works by iteratively inserting each element into its correct position within the already sorted part of the array. The insert() function shifts larger elements to the right to make space for the element being inserted.\\n- Edge Cases and Constraints: The constraints specify the size and range of values in the array. No specific edge cases are mentioned but handling an empty array or array of size one should be considered.\\n- Implementing the insert() Function: This involves picking the element to be inserted and iterating through the sorted portion to find the appropriate position, shifting larger elements, and placing the element in its correct position. This shifting must be done carefully to maintain order.\\n- Implementing the insertionSort() Function: This function iterates through the array.  For each element (starting from the second), it calls the insert() function to place it correctly within the already sorted sub-array to its left.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the core principle behind the Insertion Sort algorithm, and how does it differ from other sorting algorithms like bubble sort or selection sort?\",\n    \"How does the insert() function contribute to the Insertion Sort algorithm, and what is its role in the sorting process?\",\n    \"What are the key steps involved in correctly positioning an element within a sorted sub-array using the insert() function?\",\n    \"What kind of challenges might you face when implementing the insert() function, and how do you ensure that the algorithm maintains the array in a partially sorted state?\",\n    \"What are some potential edge cases or input scenarios that you might need to consider when implementing the insert() and insertionSort() functions, and how do they impact the algorithm's behavior?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Insertion sort builds a sorted array one element at a time. It iterates through the array, picking an element and inserting it into the correct position within the sorted portion of the array to its left. Unlike bubble sort, which repeatedly compares and swaps adjacent elements, or selection sort, which finds the minimum element in each pass, insertion sort focuses on placing elements in their correct sorted positions iteratively.\",\n    \"The insert() function is a helper function that handles the insertion of a single element into its correct position within the already sorted portion of the array. It effectively expands the sorted sub-array by one element in each iteration of the main insertionSort() function.\",\n    \"The insert() function picks the element to be inserted. It then iterates backwards through the sorted portion of the array, shifting any elements larger than the target element one position to the right to make space. Finally, it places the target element into the created space, ensuring that the sub-array remains sorted.\",\n    \"One challenge is correctly shifting elements in the sorted portion of the array without losing any data. Careful attention must be paid to the indices to ensure that elements are moved to the correct positions and that the target element is placed in its sorted position.  You have to make sure the sorted part remains sorted.\",\n    \"Edge cases might include an empty array or an array with only one element. In these cases, the insertionSort() function should simply return the array as it is already sorted or requires no sorting. Another edge case would be an array which is already completely sorted - the algorithm should still correctly identify the correct position of each element although no shifts are really needed.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
