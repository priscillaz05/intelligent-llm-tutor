If you use discriminant,when discriminant = 0, x1 = x2 = root => return sum of both roots. There will always be valid arguments. \\n\\nQuadratic equation - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def roots(a, b, c):\\n\\tif b ** 2 >= 4 * a * c:\\n\\t\\treturn round(-b / a, 2)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The task is to write a function that calculates the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation, given its coefficients (a, b, c). The function needs to handle cases where the roots are real (discriminant >= 0). If the roots are complex, it should return None. Also, the result needs to be rounded to 2 decimal places.\\n- Recall Quadratic Formula: The sum of the roots of a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is given by -b/a. The discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) determines the nature of the roots.\\n- Consider Edge Cases: The primary edge case is when the discriminant is negative (b^2 < 4ac), indicating complex roots. In this case, the function should return None.\\n- Implementing the Solution: Calculate the discriminant. If the discriminant is non-negative, calculate the sum of the roots using -b/a, round it to 2 decimal places, and return the result. If the discriminant is negative, return None.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the formula to calculate the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation?\",\n    \"How do you determine if a quadratic equation has real roots?\",\n    \"What should the function return if the quadratic equation does not have real roots?\",\n    \"How should the returned sum of roots be formatted?\",\n    \"What edge cases should be considered in the implementation?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The sum of the roots of a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is -b/a.\",\n    \"A quadratic equation has real roots if the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is greater than or equal to zero.\",\n    \"If the quadratic equation does not have real roots, the function should return None.\",\n    \"The returned sum of roots should be rounded to 2 decimal places.\",\n    \"The primary edge case is when the discriminant is negative, indicating complex roots.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
