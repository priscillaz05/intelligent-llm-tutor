The goal is to find the binary representation of MEX(S).\\n- Identifying Base Cases: If '0' is not a subsequence of S (S contains only '1's), then MEX(S) = 0. If '1' is not a subsequence of S (S contains only '0's), then MEX(S) = 1. These are important base cases.\\n- Formulating a Strategy: Start by checking simple subsequences (0, 1, 10, 11, 100, etc.) to see if they exist in the input string S. The first binary string that cannot be found as a subsequence is the answer. Efficient subsequence checking will be key.\\n- Optimizing Subsequence Search: Instead of generating binary strings and then checking for them as subsequences, you can build the target binary representation dynamically based on the string S.\\n- Algorithm Idea: Find the first '1' in S. Start constructing a binary string with this '1'. Then, if you can follow the '1' with another '1' or '0' from S, continue growing the string as a subsequence of S. If you cannot append the bit, this is the end of the valid subsequence, and thus, we've found MEX(S).\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for a string to be a subsequence of another string?\",\n    \"What are some edge cases to consider based on the possible inputs for S?\",\n    \"How can we efficiently search for a binary string as a subsequence of S without generating all possible subsequences?\",\n    \"If S contains only '1's, what is MEX(S)? If S contains only '0's, what is MEX(S)?\",\n    \"How can we build the minimal binary string that is not a subsequence using the input string S?\",\n    \"How do we efficiently determine if a binary string is a subsequence of a given string?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A string A is a subsequence of string B if A can be formed by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from B without changing the order of the remaining characters.\",\n    \"If S is empty, MEX(S) is 0. If S contains only 0s or only 1s, we have simple base cases. Long strings might require efficient search strategies.\",\n    \"We don't need to generate all subsequences. Instead, we can try to match the target binary string to S, one bit at a time, using a greedy approach to minimize the integer value.\",\n    \"If S contains only '1's, MEX(S) = 0 (binary \\\"0\\\"). If S contains only '0's, MEX(S) = 1 (binary \\\"1\\\").\",\n    \"Find the first '1' in S. Start constructing a binary string with '1'. Greedily append either '0' or '1' as long as the string remains a subsequence of S. The first appendage that fails to maintain the subsequence property determines MEX(S).\",\n    \"Iterate through the binary string and S simultaneously. For each character in the binary string, find the next matching character in S. If a match is found, move to the next character in both strings.
