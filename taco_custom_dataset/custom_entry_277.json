"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"There is one card each with the numbers from \\\"1\\\" to \\\"10\\\", for a total of 10 cards. This card has numbers on the front and nothing on the back. Using this card, you and your opponent will play the game according to the following rules.\\n\\n1. You and your opponent are dealt a total of two cards, one face up and one back up. You can see the numbers on the front card of your opponent, but not the numbers on the back card.\\n2. You win when the total number of cards dealt is 20 or less and greater than the total number of your opponent. For example, if your card is \\\"7\\\" \\\"8\\\" (15 total) and your opponent's card is \\\"9\\\" \\\"10\\\" (19 total), your opponent wins.\\n3. You and your opponent can draw up to one more card. You don't have to pull it.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, as a guide to deciding whether to draw one more card, consider the probability that the total will be 20 or less when you draw a card, and if that probability is 50% or more, draw a card. When calculating this probability, you can use the information of your two cards and the card on the opponent's table for a total of three cards. In other words, you don't draw those cards because you only have one for each card.\\n\\nA program that reads your two cards and your opponent's front card, and outputs YES if there is a 50% or greater probability that the total will be 20 or less when you draw one more card, otherwise it will output NO. Please create.\\n\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe input consists of multiple datasets. Given that the number on your first card is C1, the number on your second card is C2, and the number on your opponent's face card is C3, each dataset is given in the following format: ..\\n\\n\\nC1 C2 C3\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nPrint YES or NO on one line for each dataset.\\n\\nExample\\n\\nInput\\n\\n1 2 3\\n5 6 9\\n8 9 10\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"while 1:\\n\\ta = [i + 1 for i in range(10)]\\n\\ttry:\\n\\t\\tb = list(map(int, input().split()))\\n\\texcept:\\n\\t\\tbreak\\n\\tfor i in b:\\n\\t\\ta.remove(i)\\n\\tprint('YES' if sum([1 for i in a if i <= 20 - sum(b[:2])]) / 7 >= 0.5 else 'NO')\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem describes a card game where the goal is to determine whether to draw another card based on the probability of the new total being less than or equal to 20. The probability must be at least 50% to warrant drawing a card.\\n- Identifying Constraints: Only cards numbered 1 to 10 exist. Input contains your two cards (C1, C2) and your opponent's visible card (C3). Three cards are not available for drawing.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: Calculate the sum of your two cards (C1 + C2). Determine the cards remaining by subtracting the three known cards from the deck of 1-10. Count how many of the remaining cards would result in a total less than or equal to 20 when added to C1 + C2. Calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the number of remaining cards. Output \\\"YES\\\" if the probability is >= 0.5, else output \\\"NO\\\".\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Must handle cases where input terminates. Be careful with floating-point precision issues.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you represent the deck of cards, and how do you efficiently remove the known cards from it?\",\n    \"How would you compute the sum of favorable outcomes?\",\n    \"What should be the output if there's no more input to read?\",\n    \"How do you handle the division to decide whether to draw another card?\",\n    \"How do you avoid floating-point problems?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The deck of cards can be represented using a list of numbers from 1 to 10. To remove the cards you and your opponent have, you can create a new list that does not contain those numbers using list comprehension.\",\n    \"Iterate through the remaining cards and count how many, when added to the sum of your initial two cards, are less than or equal to 20.\",\n    \"Terminate the execution gracefully without errors when there are no more lines of input.\",\n    \"Calculate the probability of getting a sum less than or equal to 20 after drawing the card. Draw the card only if the probability is >= 0.5. Otherwise, don't draw it.\",\n    \"The ground truth doesn't have an issue with this, since integer division is effectively used.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
