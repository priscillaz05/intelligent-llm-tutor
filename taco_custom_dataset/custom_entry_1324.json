Recognize that diagonals start from the left edge and move diagonally downwards.\\n- Handling Base Cases: Understand that when n=0, the diagonal is all 1s, and when l=0, an empty list should be returned.\\n- Deriving the Formula: Determine how each number in a diagonal is related to the previous number. Realize that the next number can be calculated using a multiplicative formula involving the diagonal number (n) and the current element index (k).\\n- Implementing Iterative Calculation: Implement an iterative algorithm that calculates the next element by multiplying the previous element by (n + k) / k where k is index in array.
