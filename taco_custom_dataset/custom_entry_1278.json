During his Mathematics of Olympiads (MoO) class, Kevin was confronted with a weird functional equation and needs your help. For two fixed integers k and p, where p is an odd prime number, the functional equation states that \\n\\n<image>\\n\\nfor some function <image>. (This equation should hold for any integer x in the range 0 to p - 1, inclusive.)\\n\\nIt turns out that f can actually be many different functions. Instead of finding a solution, Kevin wants you to count the number of distinct functions f that satisfy this equation. Since the answer may be very large, you should print your result modulo 109 + 7.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe input consists of two space-separated integers p and k (3 \u2264 p \u2264 1 000 000, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 p - 1) on a single line.

This means that elements x, kx mod p, k^2x mod p, ... form a cycle, and f must have the same value for all elements in a cycle. \\n- Handling Special Cases: If k = 0, then f(x) = f(0) for all x != 0. So, all values except f(0) must be the same, and f(0) can be anything. If k = 1, then f(x) = f(x) which is trivial.  In this case each element can be mapped to any value from 0 to p-1, so there are p possible values for each of the p elements, leading to p^p possibilities.\\n- General Approach: Find the length of each cycle. The length 't' of a cycle starting from x is the smallest positive integer such that k^t * x mod p = x. Since each cycle must have the same function value, the number of possible choices for each cycle is p (0 to p-1). Count the number of cycles. The total number of possible functions is p^(number of cycles), mod 10^9 + 7. Since f(0) = f(0), this is one cycle of size 1, so we consider x from 1 to p-1. Then group these numbers to cycles of sizes t.\\n- Cycle Length Calculation: Determine the cycle length for elements 1 to p-1. The number of cycles of length 't' is (p - 1) / t. Then count the number of possible functions as p^(number of cycles) (mod 10^9 + 7).\\n\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the key property of the function f based on the functional equation?\",\n    \"How do you handle the edge cases where k = 0 and k = 1?\",\n    \"What is the general approach to count the number of distinct functions that satisfy the equation?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the length of a cycle for an element x?\",\n    \"After calculating the cycle lengths, how do you compute the number of distinct functions modulo 10^9 + 7?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The function f must have the same value for all elements within the same cycle defined by repeated multiplication by k modulo p, i.e., f(x) = f(kx mod p).\",\n    \"If k = 0, then f(x) = f(0) for all x != 0, so there are p^(p-1) possible functions.
