In each stage, the athletes are split into pairs in such a way that each athlete belongs exactly to one pair. In each pair, the athletes compete against each other, and exactly one of them wins. The winner of each pair advances to the next stage, the athlete who was defeated gets eliminated from the tournament.\\n\\nThe pairs are formed as follows:\\n\\nin the first stage, athlete $1$ competes against athlete $2$; $3$ competes against $4$; $5$ competes against $6$, and so on;\\n\\nin the second stage, the winner of the match \\\"$1$\u2013$2$\\\" competes against the winner of the match \\\"$3$\u2013$4$\\\"; the winner of the match \\\"$5$\u2013$6$\\\" competes against the winner of the match \\\"$7$\u2013$8$\\\", and so on;\\n\\nthe next stages are held according to the same rules.\\n\\nWhen athletes $x$ and $y$ compete, the winner is decided as follows:\\n\\nif $x+y$ is odd, the athlete with the lower index wins (i. e. if $x < y$, then $x$ wins, otherwise $y$ wins);\\n\\nif $x+y$ is even, the athlete with the higher index wins.\\n\\nThe following picture describes the way the tournament with $n = 3$ goes.\\n\\nYour task is the following one: given the integer $n$, determine the index of the athlete who wins the tournament.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 30$) \u2014 the number of test cases.\\n\\nEach test case consists of one line containing one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 30$).\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nFor each test case, print one integer \u2014 the index of the winner of the tournament.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\n\\nInput\\n2\\n3\\n1\\nOutput\\n7\\n1\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nThe case $n = 3$ is shown in the picture from the statement.\\n\\nIf $n = 1$, then there's only one match between athletes $1$ and $2$. Since $1 + 2 = 3$ is an odd number, the athlete with the lower index wins. So, the athlete $1$ is the winner.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import math\\nt = int(input())\\nfor _ in range(t):\\n\\tn = int(input())\\n\\tprint(int(math.pow(2, n) - 1))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding Tournament Structure: Realize that the tournament has $n$ stages and $2^n$ athletes. Each athlete is paired in each stage, and the winner advances.\\n- Analyzing Winner Determination: Understand that if the sum of two athletes' indices is odd, the smaller index wins; otherwise, the larger index wins.\\n- Identifying the Winning Pattern: Determine that in each round, the athlete with the higher index wins when the sum is even, which tends to favor higher-indexed athletes as the tournament progresses. Recognize that the ultimate winner is likely to be the highest index after n rounds of competition, which is $2^n - 1$.\\n- Calculating the Final Winner: Conclude that the winner will be athlete number $2^n - 1$. This can be found using the formula 2 to the power of n, then subtract 1.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does the tournament structure work, and how many stages are there?\",\n    \"What are the rules for determining the winner of a match based on the athletes' indices?\",\n    \"What pattern can you observe in the progression of winners throughout the tournament?\",\n    \"How can you calculate the index of the winning athlete, given the number of stages n?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The tournament has n stages where each athlete competes in pairs, and the winner advances to the next stage.\",\n    \"If the sum of the athletes' indices is odd, the lower index wins; if it's even, the higher index wins.\",\n    \"The athletes with higher indices tend to win when their indices sum to an even number, which becomes more frequent as rounds progress.\",\n    \"The index of the winning athlete can be calculated as 2^n - 1.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
