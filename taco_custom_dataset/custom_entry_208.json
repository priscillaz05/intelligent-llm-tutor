This restricts the possible swaps.\\n- Formulating a Strategy: If K is less than N/2, any two elements can be swapped and sorting the entire array is optimal. Otherwise, elements can only be swapped if they are far apart enough. This implies that the array can be split into segments that can be independently sorted, and we should consider the indices that fall into each segment.\\n- Devising an Algorithm: If K >= N/2, the elements from indices 0 to N-K-1, and indices K+1 to N-1 can be independently swapped. Sort the elements from these indices, and keep the elements at indices N-K to K in the original order.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean to find the lexicographically minimum array and how is it related to sorting?\",\n    \"Under what conditions can two elements in the array be swapped, based on the problem statement?\",\n    \"If K is small compared to N, what simplification can be made to the problem?\",\n    \"If K is close to N, can you identify segments of the array that can be sorted independently?\",\n    \"How would you handle the edge cases where the array is already sorted or K is 0?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Finding the lexicographically minimum array means arranging the elements such that, when comparing it element by element with any other possible arrangement, the first differing element is smaller in the minimum array. This is closely related to sorting, where elements are arranged in increasing order.\",\n    \"Two elements can be swapped if the absolute difference between their indices is strictly greater than K.\",\n    \"If K < N/2, any two elements in the array can be swapped by transitivity of swaps. Therefore, you can fully sort the array.\",\n    \"If K is large (close to N), then we can divide the array into two sections: from 0 to N-K-1 and from K+1 to N-1. Each of these sections can be independently sorted. The elements from N-K to K remain in their original positions since elements near them are not able to be swapped.\",\n    \"If the array is already sorted, no swaps are needed. If K is 0, no swaps are possible, and the original array remains unchanged.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
