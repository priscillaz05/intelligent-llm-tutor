So, when asked to fill the feedback form, these customers represent the feedback using a binary string (i.e a string that contains only characters '0' and '1'. \\n\\nNow since chef is not that great in deciphering binary strings, he has decided the following criteria to classify the feedback as Good or Bad : \\n\\nIf the string contains the substring \\\"010\\\" or \\\"101\\\", then the feedback is Good, else it is Bad. Note that, to be Good it is not necessary to have both of them as substring.\\n\\nSo given some binary strings, you need to output whether according to the chef, the strings are Good or Bad. \\n\\n-----Input-----\\nThe first line contains an integer T denoting the number of feedbacks. Each of the next T lines contains a string composed of only '0'  and '1'.\\n\\n-----Output-----\\nFor every test case, print in a single line Good or Bad as per the Chef's method of classification.\\n\\n-----Constraints-----\\n-  1 \u2264  T \u2264   100 \\n-  1  \u2264  |S|   \u2264  105 \\n\\nSum of length of all strings in one test file will not exceed 6*106.\\n\\n-----Example-----\\nInput:\\n2\\n11111110\\n10101010101010\\n\\nOutput:\\nBad\\nGood\\n\\n-----Explanation-----\\nExample case 1.\\n\\nThe string doesn't contain 010 or 101 as substrings.\\n\\nExample case 2.\\n\\nThe string contains both 010 and 101 as substrings.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"T = int(input())\\nfor i in range(0, T):\\n\\tS = input()\\n\\tif '101' in S or '010' in S:\\n\\t\\tprint('Good')\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tprint('Bad')\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem Requirements: The problem requires determining if a binary string is \\\"Good\\\" or \\\"Bad\\\" based on whether it contains the substrings \\\"010\\\" or \\\"101\\\".\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: The solution needs to handle multiple test cases and ensure correct string input and processing.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: The most straightforward approach is to read the input string and check if either \\\"010\\\" or \\\"101\\\" is a substring using the `in` operator in Python.\\n- Implementation Considerations: The code iterates through the test cases, reads each string, and prints \\\"Good\\\" if the condition is met, otherwise it prints \\\"Bad\\\".\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What conditions determine whether a feedback string is classified as \\\"Good\\\" or \\\"Bad\\\"?\",\n    \"How should the code handle multiple test cases as indicated by the input integer T?\",\n    \"What is the most efficient way to check if a substring exists within a larger string in Python?\",\n    \"Are there any edge cases to consider given the constraints on the string length?\",\n    \"How would you test the code to ensure it correctly identifies \\\"Good\\\" and \\\"Bad\\\" strings?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A feedback string is classified as \\\"Good\\\" if it contains either the substring \\\"010\\\" or \\\"101\\\", and \\\"Bad\\\" otherwise.\",\n    \"The code should use a loop that iterates T times, processing one string per iteration.\",\n    \"The most efficient way to check for a substring in Python is using the `in` operator (e.g., `'010' in S`).\",\n    \"Given the constraints, the code should handle strings of length up to 10^5 efficiently. There might be slight differences in runtime but it should still be fast enough.\",\n    \"To test, create test cases including strings that contain only \\\"0\\\"s and \\\"1\\\"s, strings that contain \\\"010\\\", strings that contain \\\"101\\\", and strings that contain both.
