Each office has an intergalactic teleporter that connects it to other planet offices. But the teleporters are bound to a planet's policy, so you cannot teleport to any planet you wish.\\n\\nDue to intergalactic feuds, the planets are divided into K different alliances, numbered 1 through K. You know for each planet i, the alliance that it belongs to. In other words, you're given a sequence A_{1}, A_{2}, \\\\dots, A_{n}, which says that planet i belongs to alliance A_{i}.\\n\\nEach planet i has a policy of teleportation to the planets of other alliances:\\nCost to travel from one planet to another is determined by the alliance of the destination planet. More formally, the cost to reach a planet which belongs to alliance j from planet i is represented as C_{i, j}. \\nIntra-alliance travel is free, i.e., if A_{i} = j, then C_{i, j} = 0. \\nFor a planet i, there are some forbidden alliances as well. For these alliances, C_{i, j} = -1, given that alliance j is forbidden to travel from planet i.\\n\\nAs MIB is bound to follow the intergalactic rules and since they have limited funds (yes, the government is cheap everywhere), they have decided to find the most optimal way to travel to each of the planets from the base station at planet S. With all other agents busy with their missions, you are assigned the task to find these minimum-cost paths. This is your first task in MIB, so don't let them down!\\n\\n------ Input Format ------ \\n\\n- The first line will consist of three space-separated integers N, K, and S (number of planets, number of alliances, and base planet).\\n- Second-line will consist of N space-separated integers representing A_{i}, the alliance corresponding to the i^{th} planet.\\n- Each of the next N lines will consist of K space-separated integers, where the j^{th} integer of the i^{th} line represents C_{i, j}, the cost to travel from planet i to alliance j.\\n\\n------ Output Format ------ \\n\\nPrint N space separated integers, the i^{th} integer representing the minimal cost to reach the i^{th} planet from the base station.

We'll need to adapt it to the specific cost calculation rules based on alliances.\\n- Data Structures: A dictionary (or list) to store the alliance of each planet. A 2D list (or list of lists) to store the cost to travel from a planet to each alliance. A priority queue (heap) to keep track of the planets to visit next, prioritized by their distance from the source planet. A dictionary or array to keep track of shortest distance to each planet from the source. A set to store visited planets.\\n- Implementing Dijkstra's: Initialize distances to infinity for all planets, except the source planet (distance 0). Use a min-heap to keep track of the planet to visit next based on minimum distance from source. While the heap is not empty, pop the planet with the smallest distance. Update the distances of its neighbors by calculating the cost to reach them via current planet, following alliance based travel rules. If a shorter path is found to a neighboring planet, update its distance and add it to the priority queue. Handle forbidden alliances with cost -1 to denote unreachable planets.\\n- Edge Cases and Constraints: Handle cases where planets are unreachable (cost -1). Consider the constraints for N and K to optimize space and time complexity.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can Dijkstra's algorithm be adapted to consider the cost function that depends on the destination alliance rather than a direct edge cost between planets?\",\n    \"How should unreachable planets due to forbidden alliances be handled in the algorithm, especially when calculating minimum costs?\",\n    \"How can the space and time complexity be optimized, considering the constraints on N and K, to efficiently implement Dijkstra's algorithm with the given cost function and constraints?\",\n    \"How do you handle the scenario where multiple planets belong to the same alliance and inter-alliance travel is free, and how does this affect your implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm?\",\n    \"How do you convert the planet number to array index when retrieving/updating data?\",\n    \"How should you initialize the distance for all planets at the start of the dijkstra algorithm?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Instead of storing edge costs between individual planets, the Dijkstra's algorithm needs to consider the alliance costs. For each planet, the cost to reach another planet depends on the alliance of the destination planet. Therefore, when relaxing edges, the cost is determined by C_{i, j}, where i is the current planet and j is the alliance of the potential next planet.\",\n    \"Unreachable planets (due to C_{i, j} = -1) should be assigned a distance of infinity initially or during the distance update step. When a planet is unreachable, the algorithm should propagate -1 as the minimal cost to reach the particular planet from source. This can be implemented by checking if C_{i,j} is equal to -1 before considering the next planet.\",\n    \"Given the constraints, using a priority queue (heap) is crucial for efficiency. Space can be optimized by using dictionaries or arrays carefully. For larger values of K, hash tables (dictionaries) can provide faster lookups. Ensure memory access patterns are efficient to leverage caching.\",\n    \"Planets belonging to the same alliance have a travel cost of 0 between them.  When implementing Dijkstra's, you can explore all planets belonging to the same alliance as the current planet without increasing the distance (effectively treating the alliance as a single node in the initial traversal). This means not adding to the heap.\",\n    \"Since planet is 1-based indexed and array/list is 0-based indexed. To retrieve or update data, planet number - 1 should be the corresponding array index.\",\n    \"The distance for source planet should be initialized to 0 and distance for all other planets should be initialized to infinity\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
