For example, the strings YES, yes, Yes and yES are identical.\\n\\n------ Constraints ------ \\n\\n$1 \u2264 T \u2264 100$\\n$1 \u2264 X, Y \u2264 100$\\n\\n----- Sample Input 1 ------ \\n4\\n1 10\\n10 1\\n11 1\\n97 7\\n\\n----- Sample Output 1 ------ \\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\n\\n----- explanation 1 ------ \\nTest case $1$: The following count is $1$ while the follower count is $10$. Since the following count is not more than $10$ times the follower count, the account is not spam.\\n\\nTest case $2$: The following count is $10$ while the follower count is $1$. Since the following count is not more than $10$ times the follower count, the account is not spam.\\n\\nTest case $3$: The following count is $11$ while the follower count is $1$. Since the following count is more than $10$ times the follower count, the account is spam.\\n\\nTest case $4$: The following count is $97$ while the follower count is $7$.

The task is to determine if an account is spam given its following and follower counts.\\n- Input Processing: Read the number of test cases, then for each case, read the following and follower counts.\\n- Condition Checking: Check if the following count is more than 10 times the follower count.\\n- Output: Print 'YES' if the condition is met, otherwise print 'NO'.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the key condition that determines if an account is classified as spam in this problem?\",\n    \"How should the input be processed to handle multiple test cases?\",\n    \"What data types are appropriate for storing the follower and following counts, given the constraints?\",\n    \"How is the comparison between the following and follower counts implemented in the code?\",\n    \"What is the expected output format, and how do you handle different cases according to whether an account is spam or not?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"An account is classified as spam if the following count is strictly greater than 10 times the follower count.\",\n    \"The input should be processed by first reading the number of test cases 'T'. Then, for each test case, read the following and follower counts from a single line.\",\n    \"Integers are appropriate for storing the follower and following counts because the constraints specify that X and Y are integers between 1 and 100 inclusive.\",\n    \"The comparison is implemented by checking if the 'following' count (n) is greater than 10 times the 'follower' count (m).\",\n    \"The expected output format is 'YES' if the account is spam and 'NO' otherwise, printed on a new line for each test case.
