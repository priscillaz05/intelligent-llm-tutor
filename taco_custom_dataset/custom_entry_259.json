In order to celebrate this, he posted a video with an interesting problem he couldn't solve yet. Can you help him?\\n\\nYou're given a tree \u2014 a connected undirected graph consisting of n vertices connected by n - 1 edges. The tree is rooted at vertex 1. A vertex u is called an ancestor of v if it lies on the shortest path between the root and v. In particular, a vertex is an ancestor of itself.\\n\\nEach vertex v is assigned its beauty x_v \u2014 a non-negative integer not larger than 10^{12}. This allows us to define the beauty of a path. Let u be an ancestor of v. Then we define the beauty f(u, v) as the greatest common divisor of the beauties of all vertices on the shortest path between u and v. Formally, if u=t_1, t_2, t_3, ..., t_k=v are the vertices on the shortest path between u and v, then f(u, v) = \\\\gcd(x_{t_1}, x_{t_2}, ..., x_{t_k}). Here, \\\\gcd denotes the greatest common divisor of a set of numbers. In particular, f(u, u) = \\\\gcd(x_u) = x_u.\\n\\nYour task is to find the sum\\n\\n$$$ \\\\sum_{u is an ancestor of v} f(u, v). $$$\\n\\nAs the result might be too large, please output it modulo 10^9 + 7.\\n\\nNote that for each y, \\\\gcd(0, y) = \\\\gcd(y, 0) = y.

The value x_v denotes the beauty of vertex v.\\n\\nThe following n - 1 lines describe the edges of the tree.

The tree is rooted at vertex 1.\\n- Data Structures: The input is a tree represented by its edges, along with node values (beauties). A suitable representation involves an adjacency list to store the tree's structure and an array to store the node values. A deque is useful for Breadth-First Search (BFS). A list of GCDs needs to be stored at each step during BFS.\\n- Algorithm Selection: Since we need to traverse the tree and calculate the GCD along ancestor-descendant paths, Breadth-First Search (BFS) from the root is appropriate. For each node visited, we maintain a list of GCDs encountered along the path from the root to that node. When visiting a new node, we compute the GCD of its value with each GCD in the list, updating the sum accordingly.\\n- Edge Cases: Consider edge cases such as trees with a single node or nodes with a beauty of 0, given gcd(0, x) = x.\\n- Modulo Arithmetic: Since the result needs to be modulo 10^9 + 7, we apply the modulo operation after each addition to prevent overflow.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you represent the tree structure given the input format, and what data structure is suitable for this?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently traverse the tree to compute the GCD along all ancestor-descendant paths?\",\n    \"How do you handle the GCD calculation, especially considering the beauty of a node can be 0?\",\n    \"What edge cases should you consider, and how do you manage the modulo operation to avoid overflow?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The tree structure can be represented using an adjacency list, where each index represents a node, and the list at that index contains its neighboring nodes.\",\n    \"Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the root node (vertex 1) is suitable. While traversing, keep track of the GCDs along the path.\",\n    \"The GCD calculation should use the `gcd` function from the `math` module, handling cases where one or both inputs are 0. gcd(0, x) = x.\",\n    \"Edge cases include trees with a single node or nodes with a beauty of 0.
