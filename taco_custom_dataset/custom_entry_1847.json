In this competition there are N hills in a row, and the initial height of i-th hill is Ai. Participants are required to demonstrate their jumping skills by doing what the judges tell them.\\nJudges will give each participant a card which has two numbers, i and k, which means that the participant should start at the i-th hill and jump k times, where one jump should be from the current hill to the nearest hill to the right which is strictly higher (in height) than the current one. If there is no such hill or its distance (i.e. difference between their indices)  is more than 100 then the participant should remain in his current hill.\\nPlease help Chef by creating a program to use it during the competitions. It should read the initial heights of the hill and should support two kinds of operations:\\nType 1: Given a two numbers: i and k, your program should output the index of the hill the participant is expected to finish if he starts from the i-th hill (as explained above).\\nType 2: Given three numbers: L, R, X, the heights of all the hills between L and R, both end points inclusive, should be increased by X (if X is negative then their height is decreased).\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n- First line contains two integers N and Q, denoting the number of hills and number of operations respectively.\\n- Second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the initial heights of the hills.\\n- Each of the next Q lines describes an operation. If the first integer is equal to 1, it means that the operation is of Type 1, and it will be followed by two integers i and k. Otherwise the first number will be equal to 2, and it means that the operation is of Type 2, and so it will be followed by three integers L, R and X.\\n\\n-----Output-----\\nFor each operation of Type 1, output the index of the hill in which the participant will finish.\\n\\n-----Constraints-----\\n- 1 \u2264 N, Q \u2264 100,000\\n- 1 \u2264 Ai \u2264 1,000,000\\n- 1 \u2264 L \u2264 R \u2264 N\\n- -1,000,000 \u2264 X \u2264 1,000,000\\n- 1 \u2264 i, k \u2264 N\\n\\n-----Subtasks-----\\n- Subtask 1 (20 points) : 1 \u2264 N, Q \u2264 1,000 \\n- Subtask 2 (80 points) : Original constraints\\n\\n-----Example-----\\nInput:\\n5 3\\n1 2 3 4 5\\n1 1 2\\n2 3 4 -1\\n1 1 2\\n\\nOutput:\\n3\\n4\\n\\n-----Explanation-----\\nThe initial heights are (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first operation is of Type 1 and starts from Hill 1 and wants to jump twice. The first jump will be to Hill 2, and the second jump will be to Hill 3. Hence the output for this is 3.\\nThe second operation changes the heights to (1, 2, 2, 3, 5).\\nThe last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"(n, q) = list(map(int, input().split()))\\nfinal = []\\nheight = list(map(int, input().split()))\\nfor k in range(0, q):\\n\\tb = input().split()\\n\\tif int(b[0]) == 1:\\n\\t\\tstep = int(b[1]) - 1\\n\\t\\tfor k in range(0, int(b[2])):\\n\\t\\t\\ttemp = 0\\n\\t\\t\\tj = 1\\n\\t\\t\\twhile j in range(1, 101) and temp == 0 and (step + j < n):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif height[step + j] > height[step]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tstep = step + j\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttemp = 1\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tj += 1\\n\\t\\tfinal.append(step + 1)\\n\\telif int(b[0]) == 2:\\n\\t\\tfor k in range(int(b[1]) - 1, int(b[2])):\\n\\t\\t\\theight[k] = height[k] + int(b[3])\\nfor l in range(0, len(final)):\\n\\tprint(final[l])\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem involves simulating a hill jumping competition with two types of operations: jump simulation and height update. The primary challenge lies in correctly simulating the jumps based on the given rules and updating hill heights accordingly.\\n- Algorithm Selection for Type 1 Operation: For the jump simulation (Type 1 operation), an iterative approach is needed. For each jump, we must find the nearest hill to the right that is strictly higher than the current hill, with a maximum jump distance of 100. If no such hill exists within the distance limit, the participant remains at the current hill.\\n- Algorithm Selection for Type 2 Operation: For the height update (Type 2 operation), iterate through the specified range and adjust the heights of the hills by the given value. Keep in mind that X can be negative.\\n- Data Structures: An array (or list) will be used to store the heights of the hills, allowing easy access and modification.\\n- Edge Cases/Constraints: Account for edge cases where no higher hill is within the jump range, or the jump limit is reached. Ensure index out-of-bounds errors are avoided.\\n- Optimization Considerations: Given the constraints (N, Q <= 100,000), optimize the jump simulation to avoid unnecessary iterations. Especially be mindful of the nested loops in type 1 operation. Early termination of the search for the next hill if constraints are violated can help reduce time complexity.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you handle the case where no hill to the right is strictly higher within the jump distance limit during a Type 1 operation?\",\n    \"When performing a Type 2 operation, what steps do you need to take to ensure that array indices stay within the valid range?\",\n    \"During a Type 1 operation, what data structure would you use to efficiently store and update the hill heights and jump positions?\",\n    \"How can you optimize the search for the next higher hill during a jump (Type 1 operation) to ensure it doesn't exceed the time limit, considering the problem's constraints?\",\n    \"How should negative values of X (height change) be handled in the Type 2 operation, and what implications might they have?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"If no hill to the right is strictly higher within a distance of 100, the participant remains on the current hill, and the jump is considered complete.\",\n    \"Ensure that the start and end indices L and R are adjusted to be 0-based indices (L-1 and R-1) and that they remain within the valid bounds of the hill height array.\",\n    \"An array (or list) provides direct access to hill heights using indices, making it suitable for both updating heights and traversing hills during jumps.\",\n    \"Limit the search for the next higher hill to a maximum distance of 100 to the right of the current hill. Terminate the search once a higher hill is found or the distance limit is reached. Avoid iterating through the entire array for each jump.\",\n    \"Negative values of X should be subtracted from the hill heights within the range. Ensure that hill heights don't fall below the acceptable lower bound, if any is specified implicitly or explicitly (though, the constraints do not specify any lower bounds). Also, there might be a need to update the cached jump values if they are computed a priori.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
