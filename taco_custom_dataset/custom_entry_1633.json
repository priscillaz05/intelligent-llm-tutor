The numbers on each card are distinct, but distinct cards can have equal numbers. The card of the i-th player contains m_{i} numbers.\\n\\nDuring the game the host takes numbered balls one by one from a bag. He reads the number aloud in a high and clear voice and then puts the ball away. All participants cross out the number if it occurs on their cards. The person who crosses out all numbers from his card first, wins. If multiple people cross out all numbers from their cards at the same time, there are no winners in the game. At the beginning of the game the bag contains 100 balls numbered 1 through 100, the numbers of all balls are distinct.\\n\\nYou are given the cards for each player. Write a program that determines whether a player can win the game at the most favorable for him scenario or not.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line of the input contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of the players. Then follow n lines, each line describes a player's card. The line that describes a card starts from integer m_{i} (1 \u2264 m_{i} \u2264 100) that shows how many numbers the i-th player's card has. Then follows a sequence of integers a_{i}, 1, a_{i}, 2, ..., a_{i}, m_{i} (1 \u2264 a_{i}, k \u2264 100) \u2014 the numbers on the i-th player's card. The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.\\n\\nIt is guaranteed that all the numbers on each card are distinct.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nPrint n lines, the i-th line must contain word \\\"YES\\\" (without the quotes), if the i-th player can win, and \\\"NO\\\" (without the quotes) otherwise.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n3\\n1 1\\n3 2 4 1\\n2 10 11\\n\\nOutput\\nYES\\nNO\\nYES\\n\\nInput\\n2\\n1 1\\n1 1\\n\\nOutput\\nNO\\nNO\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def contiene(l, s, n, m):\\n\\tj = 0\\n\\tfor i in range(n):\\n\\t\\tx = l[i]\\n\\t\\twhile j < m and (not l[i] == s[j]):\\n\\t\\t\\tj += 1\\n\\t\\tif j == m and (not i == n):\\n\\t\\t\\treturn False\\n\\treturn True\\nn = int(input())\\nl = []\\nm = []\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\ts = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\\n\\tm.append(s[0])\\n\\tl.append(s[1:])\\n\\tl[i].sort()\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\tcanWin = True\\n\\tfor j in range(n):\\n\\t\\tif not j == i:\\n\\t\\t\\tif m[i] < m[j]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontinue\\n\\t\\t\\tif contiene(l[j], l[i], m[j], m[i]):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcanWin = False\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\tif canWin:\\n\\t\\tprint('YES')\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tprint('NO')\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem describes a bingo game where players have cards with unique numbers, and the goal is to determine if each player can win under the most favorable scenario.\\n- Identifying Constraints: There are 'n' players (1 <= n <= 100), each with a card containing 'm_i' numbers (1 <= m_i <= 100). The numbers on the cards are distinct but can be repeated across different cards. The bag contains numbers from 1 to 100.\\n- Devising a Strategy: A player can win if no other player's card is a subset of the player's card.  Therefore, for each player, iterate through all other players and check if the other player's card is fully contained within the current player's card. If no other player's card is a subset, the player can win.\\n- Implementation Details: The input for each player consists of the number of integers on their card followed by the integers themselves. This input needs to be parsed. A helper function will be needed to check if one list is a subset of another. Sorting the lists before checking for subsets will optimize the process.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the key condition for a player to be able to win the game?\",\n    \"How can we efficiently determine if one player's card is a subset of another player's card?\",\n    \"What data structures are suitable for storing the cards of each player, considering the need to check for subsets?\",\n    \"How should the input be parsed to correctly extract the card information for each player?\",\n    \"What is the time complexity of the chosen solution, and are there any potential optimizations?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A player can win if no other player has a card whose numbers are all contained within the winning player's card.\",\n    \"One efficient way to check if one list is a subset of another is to sort both lists and then iterate through them, checking if all the elements of the potential subset are present in the larger list.\",\n    \"Lists (or arrays) are suitable for storing the cards, as they allow easy access and iteration.\",\n    \"The input should be parsed line by line. The first number on each line indicates the number of elements on that card. The remaining numbers are the card's values.\",\n    \"The time complexity will primarily depend on the subset checking. Sorting the lists takes O(m log m) time, where m is the length of the largest card. The subset check then takes O(m+n) where n is also the length of the current card. We can potentially optimize by early stopping if we determine some other player will be faster and will automatically win. If we do every comparison, then we have a complexity of O(n^2 * m log m), where n is the number of players.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
