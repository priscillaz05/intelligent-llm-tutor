Acknowledge the constraint of O(1) time complexity, which means iterating through all possible squares is not an option.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Realize that perfect squares can be generated by squaring integers. Determine the smallest and largest integers whose squares fall within the range [a, b]. Calculate the number of integers within that range to find the count of perfect squares.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Ensure proper handling of floating-point to integer conversion to get the correct range boundaries.
