He asked what is this number and the teacher of mathematics Inna Petrovna answered Vova that n is the answer to the arithmetic task for first-graders. In the textbook, a certain positive integer x was given. The task was to add x to the sum of the digits of the number x written in decimal numeral system.\\n\\nSince the number n on the board was small, Vova quickly guessed which x could be in the textbook. Now he wants to get a program which will search for arbitrary values of the number n for all suitable values of x or determine that such x does not exist. Write such a program for Vova.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 109).\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nIn the first line print one integer k \u2014 number of different values of x satisfying the condition. \\n\\nIn next k lines print these values in ascending order.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nInput\\n\\n21\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n1\\n15\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n20\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n0\\n\\nNote\\n\\nIn the first test case x = 15 there is only one variant: 15 + 1 + 5 = 21.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import sys\\ntext = sys.stdin.read().strip()\\nn = int(text)\\nq = lambda x: sum([int(b) for b in str(x)])\\ne = []\\nfor i in range(max(0, n - 81), n):\\n\\tif i + q(i) == n:\\n\\t\\te.append(i)\\nprint(len(e))\\nfor z in e:\\n\\tprint(z)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires finding all positive integers x such that x + sum of digits of x = n, where n is a given positive integer. The output should be the number of such x values and the x values themselves in ascending order.\\n- Defining the Search Space: Since the sum of digits of x is always positive, x must be less than n. The maximum value of the sum of digits of x when x is a 9-digit number is 9 * 9 = 81. Therefore, we only need to search for x values in the range [n-81, n-1], ensuring x >= 0.\\n- Implementing the Solution: Iterate through the possible x values, calculate the sum of digits for each x, check if x + sum of digits of x equals n, and store the x values that satisfy this condition. Finally, output the number of such x values and the x values themselves in ascending order.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the relationship between n and possible values of x?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently calculate the sum of the digits of a number x?\",\n    \"What is the upper bound for the sum of the digits of x, considering the constraint on n?\",\n    \"How should the output be formatted according to the problem description?\",\n    \"What range of x values should be searched to ensure that all valid solutions are considered?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"x must be less than or equal to n because x plus the sum of its digits must equal n, and the sum of digits is always positive.\",\n    \"The sum of digits can be calculated by converting the number to a string and summing the integer value of each character.\",\n    \"Since n is at most 10^9, x is also at most 10^9. The maximum possible sum of digits for a 9-digit number is 9 * 9 = 81.\",\n    \"The output should first print the count of valid x values, followed by each x value on a new line, in ascending order.\",\n    \"To find all possible x values, search the range from max(0, n - 81) up to n - 1.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
