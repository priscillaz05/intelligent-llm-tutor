A bracket sequence is called a correct bracket sequence if it's possible to obtain a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters \\\"+\\\" and \\\"1\\\" into this sequence. For example, the sequences \\\"(())()\\\", \\\"()\\\" and \\\"(()(()))\\\" are correct, while the bracket sequences \\\")(\\\", \\\"(()\\\" and \\\"(()))(\\\" are not correct.\\n\\nYuhao found this problem too simple for him so he decided to make the problem harder. You are given many (not necessarily correct) bracket sequences. The task is to connect some of them into ordered pairs so that each bracket sequence occurs in at most one pair and the concatenation of the bracket sequences in each pair is a correct bracket sequence. The goal is to create as many pairs as possible.\\n\\nThis problem unfortunately turned out to be too difficult for Yuhao. Can you help him and solve it?\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^5$) \u2014 the number of bracket sequences.\\n\\nEach of the following $n$ lines contains one bracket sequence \u2014 a non-empty string which consists only of characters \\\"(\\\" and \\\")\\\".\\n\\nThe sum of lengths of all bracket sequences in the input is at most $5 \\\\cdot 10^5$.\\n\\nNote that a bracket sequence may appear in the input multiple times. In this case, you can use each copy of the sequence separately. Also note that the order in which strings appear in the input doesn't matter.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the maximum number of pairs which can be made, adhering to the conditions in the statement.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n7\\n)())\\n)\\n((\\n((\\n(\\n)\\n)\\n\\nOutput\\n2\\n\\nInput\\n4\\n(\\n((\\n(((\\n(())\\n\\nOutput\\n0\\n\\nInput\\n2\\n(())\\n()\\n\\nOutput\\n1\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first example, it's optimal to construct two pairs: \\\"((   )())\\\" and \\\"(   )\\\".\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"n = int(input())\\nparr = {}\\nnarr = {}\\nzero = 0\\nans = 0\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\ts = input()\\n\\tx = 0\\n\\ty = 0\\n\\tleft = True\\n\\tright = True\\n\\tfor j in range(len(s)):\\n\\t\\tif s[j] == '(':\\n\\t\\t\\tx += 1\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tx -= 1\\n\\t\\tif x < 0:\\n\\t\\t\\tleft = False\\n\\t\\tif s[-1 * (j + 1)] == '(':\\n\\t\\t\\ty += 1\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\ty -= 1\\n\\t\\tif y > 0:\\n\\t\\t\\tright = False\\n\\tif left and right and (x == 0):\\n\\t\\tzero += 1\\n\\telif left or right:\\n\\t\\tif x > 0:\\n\\t\\t\\tparr[x] = parr.get(x, 0) + 1\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tnarr[x] = narr.get(x, 0) + 1\\nans += zero // 2\\nfor i in narr.keys():\\n\\tans += min(narr[i], parr.get(-i, 0))\\nprint(ans)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding Correct Bracket Sequences: Define what constitutes a correct bracket sequence and how it relates to balancing opening and closing parentheses.\\n- Identifying Sequence Properties: Understand how to determine the 'balance' of a bracket sequence by tracking the difference between opening and closing parentheses.\\n- Categorizing Bracket Sequences: Divide bracket sequences into those that can form a correct sequence with a prefix of closing parentheses (negative balance), a suffix of opening parentheses (positive balance), or are already correct.\\n- Matching Compatible Sequences: Develop a strategy for pairing sequences with complementary balances to form correct bracket sequences.\\n- Optimizing Pairing: Determine how to maximize the number of pairs formed while adhering to the condition that each sequence is used at most once.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you define a 'correct bracket sequence', and what are some examples of valid and invalid sequences?\",\n    \"How can you determine whether a bracket sequence needs leading closing parentheses or trailing opening parentheses to become a valid sequence?\",\n    \"What data structures would be useful to efficiently store and count the bracket sequences based on their balance?\",\n    \"How would you handle bracket sequences that are already valid, and how do they contribute to forming pairs?\",\n    \"What's the process of pairing bracket sequences to ensure that each sequence is used in at most one pair and that the concatenation forms a valid bracket sequence?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A 'correct bracket sequence' can be transformed into a valid arithmetic expression by inserting '+' and '1'.
