The goal is to minimize the number of recolors needed.\\n- Identifying Potential Issues: Consider edge cases such as short garlands (length 1 or 2). The primary issue involves identifying consecutive lamps with the same color and choosing a different color to replace them.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: Iterate through the garland and check for adjacent lamps with the same color. If found, change the color of one of the lamps to a different color, ensuring it doesn't match either neighbor.\\n- Optimization Strategy: Minimize the recoloring.  In cases where three consecutive lamps are identical, changing the middle one is sufficient. We can iterate the lamps array several times to get the optimal answer.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you determine if a garland is diverse, and why is this important for the problem?\",\n    \"What are some edge cases to consider when dealing with garlands of different lengths?\",\n    \"What is the core logic for iterating through the garland and identifying lamps that need recoloring?\",\n    \"If three consecutive lamps have the same color, how do you decide which color to change and why?\",\n    \"How can you minimize the number of recolors needed to make the garland diverse?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A garland is diverse if no two adjacent lamps have the same color. This is crucial because the problem requires us to make the garland diverse with the fewest possible changes.\",\n    \"Edge cases include garlands of length 1 or 2.  For length 1, no changes are needed. For length 2, if the colors are the same, change one.  Otherwise, no change is needed.\",\n    \"Iterate through the garland and, for each lamp, check if it has the same color as its adjacent neighbors.  If the left and the current one are the same, then change the current one.\",\n    \"If three consecutive lamps have the same color, change the middle lamp to a color that is different from its neighbors. This resolves the issue in a minimal number of changes (only one).\",\n    \"Iterate through the garland, changing lamps only when necessary.  When three consecutive lamps have the same color, change only the middle one. Re-evaluate after one pass, by re-iterating.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
