More accurately, Rick screams at times b, b + a, b + 2a, b + 3a, ... and Morty screams at times d, d + c, d + 2c, d + 3c, .... The Monster will catch them if at any point they scream at the same time, so it wants to know when it will catch them (the first time they scream at the same time) or that they will never scream at the same time.\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line of input contains two integers a and b (1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 100). \\n\\nThe second line contains two integers c and d (1 \u2264 c, d \u2264 100).\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nPrint the first time Rick and Morty will scream at the same time, or  - 1 if they will never scream at the same time.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n20 2\\n9 19\\n\\nOutput\\n82\\n\\nInput\\n2 1\\n16 12\\n\\nOutput\\n-1\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first sample testcase, Rick's 5th scream and Morty's 8th time are at time 82. \\n\\nIn the second sample testcase, all Rick's screams will be at odd times and Morty's will be at even times, so they will never scream at the same time.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def compute_gcd(a, b):\\n\\tif a == 0:\\n\\t\\treturn b\\n\\treturn compute_gcd(b % a, a)\\n\\ndef main():\\n\\t(a, b) = map(int, input().split())\\n\\t(c, d) = map(int, input().split())\\n\\tgcd = compute_gcd(a, c)\\n\\tif (b - d) % gcd != 0:\\n\\t\\tprint(-1)\\n\\tsteps = 1000\\n\\tsize = max(b, d) + max(a, c) * steps\\n\\tused = [False] * size\\n\\tx = b\\n\\tfor _ in range(steps):\\n\\t\\tused[x] = True\\n\\t\\tx += a\\n\\tx = d\\n\\tfor _ in range(steps):\\n\\t\\tif used[x]:\\n\\t\\t\\tprint(x)\\n\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\t\\tx += c\\nmain()\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the problem: Rick screams at times b + n*a and Morty screams at times d + m*c. The goal is to find the smallest non-negative integers n and m such that b + n*a = d + m*c, or report -1 if no such n and m exist.\\n- Considering potential solution approaches: The problem can be solved using the extended Euclidean algorithm or by simply iterating through possible scream times for Rick and Morty until a match is found (or a certain limit is reached).\\n- Addressing constraints: Since 1 \u2264 a, b, c, d \u2264 100, a brute force approach with a limited number of iterations might be feasible.\\n- Implementing Brute-Force Approach: Iterate through Rick's scream times and check if any of those times also appear in Morty's scream times.

Another is to check up to sufficiently large n and m.\",\n    \"A hash set or boolean array could be used to store Rick's scream times and quickly check if Morty's scream times exist in the set.\",\n    \"Given the constraints a, b, c, d <= 100, checking up to 1000 iterations for each should be sufficient, as the scream times grow linearly. The solution also uses 1000 as a limit.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
