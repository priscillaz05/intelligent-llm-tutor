Each student's grade is determined by their mean score across all of the tests they took this semester.\\n\\nYou've decided to automate grade calculation by writing a function `calculate_grade()` that takes a list of test scores as an argument and returns a one character string representing the student's grade calculated as follows:\\n\\n * 90% <= mean score <= 100%: `\\\"A\\\"`,\\n * 80% <= mean score < 90%: `\\\"B\\\"`,\\n * 70% <= mean score < 80%: `\\\"C\\\"`,\\n * 60% <= mean score < 70%: `\\\"D\\\"`,\\n * mean score < 60%: `\\\"F\\\"`\\n\\nFor example, `calculate_grade([92, 94, 99])` would return `\\\"A\\\"` since the mean score is `95`, and `calculate_grade([50, 60, 70, 80, 90])` would return `\\\"C\\\"` since the mean score is `70`.\\n\\nYour function should handle an input list of any length greater than zero.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"from bisect import bisect\\nfrom statistics import mean\\n\\ndef calculate_grade(scores):\\n\\treturn 'FDCBA'[bisect([60, 70, 80, 90], mean(scores))]\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understand the problem: The task is to calculate the grade based on the mean of a list of scores using predefined grade boundaries.\\n- Calculate the mean: Use the statistics.mean() function to calculate the average of the scores.\\n- Determine the grade: Use a series of if/elif/else statements or a bisect method to determine the appropriate grade based on the calculated mean and grade boundaries. The bisect method provides an elegant and concise way to find the correct grade index.\\n- Handle edge cases: Although the prompt states that the list of scores will be greater than zero, consider empty lists or lists with invalid score values for robustness (though this is not a strict requirement based on the prompt). However, there is no requirement for explicit error handling in the prompt, so the primary focus remains calculating and returning the correct grade.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the grade boundaries that determine the letter grade?\",\n    \"How can I efficiently calculate the mean of the given list of scores?\",\n    \"What data structure would be most effective for mapping score ranges to letter grades?\",\n    \"How would I use the bisect module to find the correct grade for a given mean score?\",\n    \"Given a student's test scores of [75, 85, 95], what grade should the function return, and why?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The grade boundaries are as follows: 90-100 (A), 80-89 (B), 70-79 (C), 60-69 (D), and below 60 (F).\",\n    \"You can efficiently calculate the mean of a list of scores using the statistics.mean() function.\",\n    \"A list of thresholds coupled with the bisect module is effective for mapping score ranges to grades.  Alternatively, an ordered list of if/elif/else statements can be used.\",\n    \"Use bisect(thresholds, mean_score) to find the index of the grade. This index can then be used to look up the grade in a string 'FDCBA'.\",\n    \"The function should return 'B'. The mean score is (75+85+95)/3 = 85, which falls within the 80-89 range, corresponding to a 'B' grade.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
