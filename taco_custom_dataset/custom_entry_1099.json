It involves adding the sizes of individual sets, subtracting the sizes of pairwise intersections, adding the sizes of three-way intersections, and so on.  Here, it's used to accurately count numbers divisible by at least one of the primes by adjusting for overlaps in divisibility.\",\n    \"To handle the large input range, use integer division to count multiples within the range. Ensure that intermediate calculations use appropriate data types to accommodate large numbers. Consider using floor division `//` to compute integer quotients correctly.\",\n    \"Bit manipulation can be used to represent each combination of primes. Each bit corresponds to a prime, and a '1' indicates the prime is included in the combination, while a '0' indicates it's excluded. Iterating through all possible bit patterns generates all combinations.\",\n    \"Integer overflow can occur when calculating the product of prime numbers. Use 64-bit integers (long long in C++, long in Java, or int in Python) and check that `k <= R` before attempting to divide to prevent ZeroDivisionError.\",\n    \"Thorough testing involves testing with small and large ranges, various numbers of primes, edge cases such as L=1, R=10^18, cases where L=R, and cases where one or more primes divide all the numbers in the range.
