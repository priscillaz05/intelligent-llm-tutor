Each term depends on the previous term and whether subtracting 'n' results in a positive number not already in the sequence. Otherwise, 'n' is added.\\n- Data Structures: A list is needed to store the sequence and a set to efficiently check for the presence of a number in the sequence.\\n- Algorithm Strategy: Start with a(0) = 0. Iterate from 1 to n-1, calculating each term a(i) based on a(i-1) and the conditions provided.

The conditional logic (subtraction or addition) must be carefully implemented.\",\n    \"A list (or array) is required to store the sequence itself, and a set is optimal for quickly checking if a number is already present in the sequence, which helps avoid duplicates in the sequence.\",\n    \"Using a set for checking the presence of an element ensures O(1) lookup time on average, thus maintaining the overall O(n) time complexity for generating n elements of the sequence.
