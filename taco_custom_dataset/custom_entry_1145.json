"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"You are on a game show \\\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\\\".The host presents you \\\"N\\\" number of closed doors.There is huge prize behind one door while there are sumo wrestlers behind rest of the doors.Initially you are asked to choose a door.After that the host opens (N-2) doors,revealing sumo wrestlers.The host is omniscient and always reveals sumo wrestlers when he opens the doors. The host then says to you.\\\"\\\"Do you want to pick the door you have initially chosen or you want to chose the other closed door?\\\".So it's your decision either stick with your original unopened door or switch to the other unopened door.You are good at maths so you will first calculate the probability of winning the prize by switching from the original selection.\\n\\nINPUT: \\n\\nthe first line contain number of testcases \\\"T\\\". \\\"T\\\" testcases follows then.Each testcase contains the number of doors \\\"N\\\". \\n\\nOUTPUT:\\n\\nfor each testcase output the probability of winning the prize by switching from the original selection.output upto 6 places of decimal.\\n\\nConstraint:\\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 1000\\n3 \u2264 N \u2264 1000\\n\\nSAMPLE INPUT\\n1\\n3\\n\\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\\n0.666667\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"'''\\n# Read input from stdin and provide input before running code\\n\\nname = raw_input('What is your name?\\\\n')\\nprint 'Hi, %s.' % name\\n'''\\nfor i in range(eval(input())):\\n\\tn = float(input())\\n\\tp = (n-1) / n\\n\\tprint('%f' % p)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understand the Monty Hall Problem: Recognize this is a variation of the Monty Hall problem, where switching doors increases the probability of winning.\\n- Initial Probability: Understand that the initial probability of selecting the correct door is 1/N.\\n- Host's Action: The host reveals N-2 incorrect doors, leaving only two doors unopened: the initially selected door and one other door.\\n- Probability Shift: The probability that was initially distributed among the N-1 incorrect doors is now concentrated on the single remaining closed door that was not initially selected.\\n- Calculate Probability of Winning by Switching: The probability of winning by switching is (N-1)/N.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the initial probability of selecting the door with the prize?\",\n    \"After the host reveals N-2 doors with sumo wrestlers, what does the host's knowledge tell us about the remaining unopened doors?\",\n    \"Why does switching doors increase the probability of winning in this scenario?\",\n    \"How does the number of doors, N, affect the probability of winning by switching?\",\n    \"Given N doors, what is the formula to calculate the probability of winning by switching?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The initial probability of selecting the correct door is 1/N.\",\n    \"The host knows where the prize is, and always reveals doors with sumo wrestlers.
