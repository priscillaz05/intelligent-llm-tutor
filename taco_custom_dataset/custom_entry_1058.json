The goal is to find all pronic numbers less than or equal to a given number N.\\n- Identifying the Algorithm: Determine a method to generate pronic numbers. Since pronic numbers are formed by consecutive integers, start from 0 and increment until the generated number exceeds N.\\n- Managing Boundary Conditions: Pay attention to the boundary where the calculated pronic number exceeds N. Stop the loop when the pronic number becomes greater than N.\\n- Building the List: Create and populate a list to store the pronic numbers that satisfy the condition.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What exactly is a pronic number, and how is it calculated?\",\n    \"How can you generate a sequence of pronic numbers given an upper bound N?\",\n    \"What condition should terminate the generation of pronic numbers, and why?\",\n    \"How do you store and return the sequence of pronic numbers that meet the specified criteria?\",\n    \"Is there any constraint that must be considered to achieve the required time complexity?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A pronic number is the product of two consecutive integers, e.g., n * (n + 1).\",\n    \"You can start with n = 0 and incrementally calculate n * (n + 1) until the result exceeds the upper bound N.\",\n    \"The generation should stop when n * (n + 1) becomes greater than N because we only need pronic numbers less than or equal to N.\",\n    \"Create a list to store the calculated pronic numbers and return this list as the final output.\",\n    \"The question mentions O(1) time complexity, but the solution has O(sqrt(N)) time complexity.
