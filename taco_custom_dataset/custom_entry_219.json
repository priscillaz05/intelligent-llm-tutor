Because this sum gives the same number.\\n\\nIn effect: ```89 = 8^1 + 9^2``` \\n\\nThe next number in having this property is ```135```.\\n\\nSee this property again: ```135 = 1^1 + 3^2 + 5^3```\\n\\nWe need a function to collect these numbers, that may receive two integers ```a```, ```b``` that defines the range ```[a, b]``` (inclusive) and outputs a list of the sorted numbers in the range that fulfills the property described above.\\n\\nLet's see some cases:\\n```python\\nsum_dig_pow(1, 10) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\\n\\nsum_dig_pow(1, 100) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 89]\\n```\\nIf there are no numbers of this kind in the range [a, b] the function should output an empty list.\\n```python\\nsum_dig_pow(90, 100) == []\\n```\\nEnjoy it!!\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def dig_pow(n):\\n\\treturn sum((int(x) ** y for (y, x) in enumerate(str(n), 1)))\\n\\ndef sum_dig_pow(a, b):\\n\\treturn [x for x in range(a, b + 1) if x == dig_pow(x)]\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires identifying numbers within a given range [a, b] where the number equals the sum of its digits raised to consecutive powers, starting from 1.\\n- Breaking Down the Calculation: Decompose each number into its digits. Calculate each digit raised to the power of its position (starting from 1). Sum the results.\\n- Implementing the Function: Create a function that takes a number as input, calculates the sum of its digits raised to consecutive powers, and returns the sum. Create another function that takes a range [a,b] and returns all numbers within that range satisfying the initial condition.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can I efficiently iterate through the digits of a number in Python?\",\n    \"How do I calculate the power of a number in Python?\",\n    \"How can I test if a number satisfies the eureka property within a given range?\",\n    \"What should the function return if no numbers satisfy the Eureka property within the specified range?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Convert the number to a string and iterate through the string.  Convert each character back to an integer for the calculation.\",\n    \"Use the `**` operator (e.g., `2**3` for 2 raised to the power of 3).\",\n    \"Iterate through the range and for each number in the range check if it is equal to the sum of its digits raised to consecutive powers.
