The final output is 2 * a + b, where a is the number of 4's and b is the number of 0's.\\n- Identify the Core Logic: The core logic involves finding the smallest Y for a given X, such that X * Y results in a number of the form 44...400...0.  This can be simplified to finding Y such that X * Y = 4 * (11...1) * 10^b for some number of 1's and some power of 10. Further, the number 11...1 (a times) can be represented as (10^a - 1) / 9.\\n- Mathematical Transformation: The goal is to find the minimum 'a' and 'b' such that X * Y = 4 * ((10^a - 1) / 9) * 10^b. Rearranging, we need to find the minimum 'a' such that (10^a - 1) is divisible by (9 * X / gcd(X, 4)). This essentially boils down to finding the multiplicative order of 10 modulo (9 * X / gcd(X, 4)), which can be determined using number theory algorithms. Note that the power of 10 'b' will determine how many trailing zeros we need, which is influenced by the factors of 2 and 5 present in X.\\n- Implementing the Number Theory: We need to implement functions for factorization, totient function, and multiplicative order to solve this efficiently.\\n- Factoring out 2's and 5's: We need to factor out 2's and 5's from the input integer X to determine the count of trailing zeros 'b' for the valid result. Because we want the number to start with one or more 4's. Therefore, if the number of 2s is more than 2, we have to compensate the number of zeros in the end. 4 = 2 * 2. Therefore, the numbers of 2s should be at least 2.\\n- Putting Things Together: First, factor out the 2's and 5's from X. Then, determine 'a' using the multiplicative order. Finally, calculate 'b' based on the factored 2's and 5's, ensuring the number starts with 4s. Calculate and return 2 * a + b.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you determine the values of 'a' and 'b' to satisfy the condition that X * Y has the form 44...400...0?\",\n    \"What is the multiplicative order and how does it apply to finding the minimal value of 'a'?\",\n    \"How does factoring X into its prime factors (specifically 2 and 5) help determine the number of trailing zeros ('b')?\",\n    \"What number theory algorithms are essential for efficiently solving this problem, and what do they accomplish?\",\n    \"Given the constraints, how does the efficiency of the factorization algorithm affect the overall runtime of your solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"'a' is the number of 4s and 'b' is the number of 0s. To find them, we need to find the smallest 'a' such that (10^a - 1) is divisible by a modified version of X, after factoring out the common factors of 2 and 5. Then, 'b' is determined by the powers of 2 and 5 factored out from X to ensure the resulting number has the desired form.\",\n    \"The multiplicative order of 10 modulo n is the smallest positive integer 'a' such that 10^a is congruent to 1 modulo n. In this problem, we use it to find the smallest 'a' such that (10^a - 1) is divisible by (9 * X / gcd(X, 4)).\",\n    \"Factoring X into its prime factors helps determine the number of trailing zeros 'b' required in the number X * Y. By counting the number of 2s and 5s, we can determine the appropriate power of 10 to multiply the sequence of 4s by, ensuring it is the smallest such multiple.\",\n    \"Key algorithms include factorization (to break down X into prime factors), calculating the totient function (to estimate the multiplicative order), and calculating the multiplicative order itself. These help in efficiently finding the smallest 'a' for the required multiple.\",\n    \"Since X can be up to 10^5, an efficient factorization algorithm is essential. A slow factorization method can lead to exceeding time limits. Algorithms like trial division up to the square root of the number are typically sufficient, but pre-computing primes or using more advanced algorithms can improve efficiency.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
