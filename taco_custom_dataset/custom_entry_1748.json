Instead of marching beginning with the left foot and then changing legs with each step, as ordered, he keeps repeating a sequence of steps, in which he sometimes makes the wrong steps or \u2014 horror of horrors! \u2014 stops for a while. For example, if Jack uses the sequence 'right, left, break', when the sergeant yells: 'Left! Right! Left! Right! Left! Right!', Jack first makes a step with the right foot, then one with the left foot, then he is confused and stops for a moment, then again - this time according to the order - starts with the right foot, then uses the left foot, then - to the sergeant's irritation - he stops to catch his breath, to incorrectly start with the right foot again... Marching this way, Jack will make the step that he is supposed to in the given moment in only one third of cases.\\n\\nWhen the officers convinced him he should do something about it, Jack decided to modify the basic sequence of steps that he repeats. However, in order not to get too tired, he has decided that the only thing he'll do is adding any number of breaks in any positions of the original sequence (a break corresponds to stopping for the duration of one step). Of course, Jack can't make a step on the same foot twice in a row, if there is no pause between these steps. It is, however, not impossible that the sequence of steps he used so far is incorrect (it would explain a lot, actually).\\n\\nHelp Private Jack! Given the sequence of steps he keeps repeating, calculate the maximal percentage of time that he can spend marching correctly after adding some breaks to his scheme.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line of input contains a sequence consisting only of characters 'L', 'R' and 'X', where 'L' corresponds to a step with the left foot, 'R' \u2014 with the right foot, and 'X' \u2014 to a break. The length of the sequence will not exceed 106.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nOutput the maximum percentage of time that Jack can spend marching correctly, rounded down to exactly six digits after the decimal point.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nInput\\n\\nX\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n0.000000\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\nLXRR\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n50.000000\\n\\nNote\\n\\nIn the second example, if we add two breaks to receive LXXRXR, Jack will march: LXXRXRLXXRXRL... instead of LRLRLRLRLRLRL... and will make the correct step in half the cases. If we didn't add any breaks, the sequence would be incorrect \u2014 Jack can't step on his right foot twice in a row.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def solve():\\n\\toriginal = input()\\n\\ttemp = [original[0]]\\n\\tfor i in range(1, len(original)):\\n\\t\\tif original[i] == original[i - 1] != 'X':\\n\\t\\t\\ttemp.append('X')\\n\\t\\ttemp.append(original[i])\\n\\taugmented = ''.join(temp)\\n\\tanswer = 0\\n\\tif augmented[0] == augmented[-1] != 'X':\\n\\t\\tanswer = max(rate(augmented + 'X'), rate('X' + augmented))\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tanswer = rate(augmented)\\n\\tprint('%d.%06d' % (answer / 1000000, answer % 1000000))\\n\\ndef rate(seq):\\n\\t(correct, total, unknown, indicator) = (0, 0, 0, 0)\\n\\tleft_step = True\\n\\tfor action in seq:\\n\\t\\tif action == 'X':\\n\\t\\t\\ttotal += 1\\n\\t\\t\\tleft_step = not left_step\\n\\t\\telif left_step and action == 'L' or (not left_step and action == 'R'):\\n\\t\\t\\tcorrect += 1\\n\\t\\t\\ttotal += 1\\n\\t\\t\\tindicator = 0\\n\\t\\t\\tleft_step = not left_step\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tcorrect += 1\\n\\t\\t\\ttotal += 2\\n\\t\\t\\tunknown += indicator\\n\\t\\t\\tindicator = 1 - indicator\\n\\t\\tif total % 2 == 1:\\n\\t\\t\\ttotal += 1\\n\\t\\t\\tunknown += indicator\\n\\t\\tif correct * 2 > total:\\n\\t\\t\\tcorrect -= unknown\\n\\t\\t\\ttotal -= unknown * 2\\n\\treturn correct * 100000000 // total\\nsolve()\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The goal is to maximize the percentage of correct steps by adding breaks ('X') to Jack's repeating sequence ('L', 'R', 'X'). A correct step is alternating 'L' and 'R'. Consecutive 'L' or 'R' steps must be separated by an 'X'.\\n- Identifying Constraints: The core constraint is that Jack cannot take two consecutive steps with the same foot without a break. We need to insert 'X' to enforce this.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: Insert 'X' between identical consecutive steps ('L', 'L' or 'R', 'R'). After augmentation, evaluate the original and augmented sequences.\\n- Calculating the Correctness Ratio: Calculate the rate of correct steps versus the total number of actions (steps and breaks) in a repeating sequence. A perfect alternating sequence is the gold standard.\\n- Edge Cases: Consider scenarios where the modified sequence starts and ends with conflicting steps, requiring an added break to loop correctly.\\n- Optimizing the Solution: The goal is to maximize the correctness ratio, which involves strategic break insertions and accurate percentage calculation. Consider whether to prepend or append X to the sequence.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for Jack to march correctly, and how is that defined in terms of 'L', 'R', and 'X'?\",\n    \"How do you handle the constraint that Jack can't step on the same foot twice in a row without a break?\",\n    \"How can you determine whether inserting an 'X' at a specific position will improve the percentage of correct steps?\",\n    \"Given a sequence of steps and breaks, how do you calculate the percentage of time Jack spends marching correctly?\",\n    \"Are there any edge cases or scenarios that need special consideration when calculating this percentage, especially when the sequence repeats?\",\n    \"What approach will ensure that we are maximizing the correct steps by adding breaks and not just following the problem statement?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Marching correctly means alternating steps between left ('L') and right ('R') without taking two consecutive steps on the same foot.
