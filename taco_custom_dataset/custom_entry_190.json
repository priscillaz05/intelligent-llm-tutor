The board should alternate between 'O' and 'X', starting with 'O' in the top-left corner.\\n- Identifying Edge Cases: Consider cases where `rows` or `columns` are zero or negative. Also, cases where rows or columns are one should also be handled correctly.\\n- Choosing the Right Data Structure: A list of lists (2D array) is the correct data structure.\\n- Algorithm Design: The key to solving this problem is using the row and column indices to determine whether a cell should be 'O' or 'X'. The sum of the row and column indices, modulo 2, can determine this: if `(row + col) % 2 == 0`, it's 'O'; otherwise, it's 'X'.\\n- Optimizing for Readability and Conciseness: List comprehension is an efficient method to achieve the desired output.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does the problem ask us to do, and what are the inputs and expected outputs?\",\n    \"What data structure is best suited to represent the chessboard?\",\n    \"How can the row and column indices be used to determine whether a cell should be 'O' or 'X'?\",\n    \"What happens if the input rows or columns are zero or negative?\",\n    \"Is there a concise way to implement this in Python, and does code readability matter?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The problem asks us to create a 2D array representing a chessboard pattern of a given size, where 'O' represents white spaces and 'X' represents black spaces, with the top-left corner always being 'O'.
