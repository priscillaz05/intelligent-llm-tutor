"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"Sebi goes to school daily with his father. They cross a big highway in the car to reach to the school. Sebi sits in front seat beside his father at driving seat. To kill boredom, they play a game of guessing speed of other cars on the highway. Sebi makes a guess of other car's speed being SG kph, his father FG kph. \\n\\nThe highway is usually empty, so the drivers use cruise control, i.e. vehicles run at a constant speed. There are markers on the highway at a gap of 50 meters. Both father-son duo wants to check the accuracy of their guesses. For that, they start a timer at the instant at which their car and the other car (which speed they are guessing) are parallel to each other (they need not to be against some marker, they can be in between the markers too). After some T seconds, they observe that both the cars are next to some markers and the number of markers in between the markers of their car and the other car is D - 1 (excluding the markers next to both the cars). Also, they can observe these markers easily because the other car is faster than their. Speed of Sebi's father's car is S. Using this information, one can find the speed of the other car accurately.\\n\\nAn example situation when Sebi's father starts the timer. Notice that both the car's are parallel to each other.\\n\\nExample situation after T seconds. The cars are next to the markers. Here the value of D is 1. The green car is Sebi's and the other car is of blue color.\\n\\nSebi's a child, he does not know how to find the check whose guess is close to the real speed of the car. He does not trust his father as he thinks that he might cheat. Can you help to resolve this issue between them by telling whose guess is closer. If Sebi's guess is better, output \\\"SEBI\\\". If his father's guess is better, output \\\"FATHER\\\". If both the guess are equally close, then output \\\"DRAW\\\".\\n\\n-----Input-----\\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. \\nEach of the next T lines contain five space separated integers S, SG, FG, D, T corresponding to the Sebi's car speed, Sebi's guess, his father's guess, D as defined in the statement and the time at which both the cars at against the markers (in seconds), respectively.\\n\\n-----Output-----\\nOutput description.\\nFor each test case, output a single line containing \\\"SEBI\\\", \\\"FATHER\\\" or \\\"DRAW\\\" (without quotes) denoting whose guess is better.\\n\\n-----Constraints-----\\n- 1 \u2264 T \u2264 10000\\n- 0 \u2264 S \u2264 130\\n- 0 \u2264 SG, FG \u2264 300\\n- 1 \u2264 D \u2264 30\\n- 1 \u2264 T \u2264 300\\n-  The other car speed doesn't exceed 300 kph.\\n\\n-----Example-----\\nInput:\\n2\\n100 180 200 20 60\\n130 131 132 1 72\\n\\nOutput:\\nSEBI\\nFATHER\\n\\n-----Explanation-----\\nExample case 1.\\nThere are total 20 - 1 = 19 markers in between the Sebi's car and the other car. So, the distance between those cars at time T is 20 * 50 = 1000 meters = 1 km.\\nAs T = 60 seconds, i.e. 1 minutes. So, the other car goes 1 km more than Sebi's car in 1 minute. So, the other car will go 60 km more than Sebi's car in 1 hour. So, its speed is 60 kmph more than Sebi's car, i.e. 160 kmph.\\nSebi had made a guess of 180 kmph, while his father of 200 kmph. Other car's real speed is 160 kmph. So, Sebi's guess is better than his father. Hence he wins the game.\\nExample case 2.\\n\\nThe situation of this example is depicted in the image provided in the statement. You can find the speed of other car and see that Father's guess is more accurate.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"t = int(input())\\nfor _ in range(t):\\n\\t(s, sg, fg, d, t) = map(int, input().split(' '))\\n\\tcar_speed = s + d * 50 * 3.6 / t\\n\\tsebi = abs(car_speed - sg)\\n\\tfat = abs(car_speed - fg)\\n\\tif sebi < fat:\\n\\t\\tprint('SEBI')\\n\\telif fat == sebi:\\n\\t\\tprint('DRAW')\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tprint('FATHER')\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem describes a scenario where Sebi and his father guess the speed of another car. The task is to determine whose guess is closer to the actual speed of the other car, given their car's speed, their guesses, the number of markers between the cars after a certain time, and the time elapsed.\\n- Deriving the Actual Speed: The key is to calculate the actual speed of the other car. The other car covers D markers more than Sebi's car in T seconds.  Each marker is 50 meters apart. So, the other car covers an additional D * 50 meters in T seconds. Convert meters to kilometers and seconds to hours to match the kph units.\\n- Calculating Differences:  Calculate the absolute difference between Sebi's guess and the actual speed, and the absolute difference between Father's guess and the actual speed.\\n- Comparing Differences: Compare the absolute differences. If Sebi's difference is smaller, output \\\"SEBI\\\". If Father's difference is smaller, output \\\"FATHER\\\". If they are equal, output \\\"DRAW\\\".\\n- Handling Input: Read the input carefully, parsing the space-separated values for each test case.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you calculate the actual speed of the other car based on the information given?\",\n    \"What units should be used to ensure the speeds are comparable (e.g., kph)?\",\n    \"How do you compare Sebi's and Father's guesses to the actual car speed to determine who is closer?\",\n    \"What formula converts meters and seconds to kilometers per hour?\",\n    \"How should the inputs be handled, considering there are multiple test cases?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The actual speed of the other car can be calculated by determining the additional distance covered by the other car compared to Sebi's car in the given time, and adding it to Sebi's car's speed.\",\n    \"The speeds should be in kilometers per hour (kph) to match the problem description.\",\n    \"Calculate the absolute difference between each guess and the actual speed, and compare the differences. The smaller difference indicates the closer guess.\",\n    \"To convert meters per second to kilometers per hour, multiply by 3.6. Since we have distance in meters (D * 50) and time in seconds (T) with Sebi's car speed in kph(S), the actual car speed = S + D*50*3.6/T.\",\n    \"The first line of the input indicates the number of test cases. Iterate through each test case, reading and processing the input values for each case.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
