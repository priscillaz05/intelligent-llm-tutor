The method should return the same null/empty value.\\n- Normalizing Date Values: Recognize that the provided examples suggest normalizing both the day and month. Months exceeding 12 should roll over to the next year, and days exceeding the maximum for a given month should roll over to the next month.\\n- Algorithm Selection: Consider using `datetime` module in Python to perform date arithmetic and handle leap years correctly. Decide on a strategy to parse the date string, normalize the month, and then normalize the day.\\n- Error Handling: Expect and handle `AttributeError` (due to invalid regex input), and potentially other exceptions, to return the expected `null` output for invalid formats.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How should the function handle null or empty input strings?\",\n    \"How should the function deal with an invalid date string format (e.g., \\\"YYYY.MM.DD\\\" or containing non-numeric characters)?\",\n    \"If the month is greater than 12, how should the function adjust the date?\",\n    \"If the day is greater than the number of days in the specified month (considering leap years), how should the function adjust the date?\",\n    \"What Python libraries can be used to simplify date manipulation and ensure correct date arithmetic?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"If the input string is null or empty, the function should return exactly that value (null or empty string).\",\n    \"If the date string format is invalid, the function should return null.\",\n    \"If the month is greater than 12, the function should increment the year and adjust the month accordingly (e.g., 13 becomes 1 of the next year).\",\n    \"If the day is greater than the number of days in the specified month, the function should increment the month (and potentially the year) and adjust the day accordingly, considering leap years for February.\",\n    \"The `datetime` module in Python can be used to simplify date manipulation, and the `re` module can be used to validate the format of the date.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
