Understand the valid transitions between numbers on the keypad.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy Selection: Use dynamic programming. The number of ways to form a number of length `n` ending in digit `i` can be calculated based on the number of ways to form a number of length `n-1` ending in any of the digits adjacent to `i` on the keypad.\\n- Implementation Steps: Initialize the base case for N = 1, where each digit has a count of 1. Iteratively compute the counts for lengths 2 to N using the adjacency rules. Finally, sum up the counts for each digit at length N to get the total number of possible numbers.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does the keypad layout influence the transitions between digits, and how can these valid transitions be represented?\",\n    \"What is the base case for the dynamic programming approach, and how should the DP table be initialized?\",\n    \"How can the iterative DP updates leverage the counts from the previous digit length to compute the counts for the current digit length?\",\n    \"How do I prevent double counting?\",\n    \"After calculating the number of possible numbers ending in each digit, how can the total number of possible numbers be determined?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The keypad layout dictates the valid transitions. These transitions can be represented using an adjacency list or matrix, where each digit is connected to its adjacent digits on the keypad.\",\n    \"The base case is when N = 1. Each digit (0-9) has a count of 1 because each digit can be a valid number of length 1. So, the DP table should be initialized with all digits having a count of 1.\",\n    \"The number of possible numbers of length `n` ending in digit `i` is the sum of possible numbers of length `n-1` ending in a digit `j` which is adjacent to digit `i`. This is calculated using the precomputed valid adjacency list and a nested loop structure for each length and each digit.\",\n    \"The adjacency list and iterative approach will prevent double counting.\",\n    \"Sum up the counts of possible numbers ending in each digit (0-9) at length N.
