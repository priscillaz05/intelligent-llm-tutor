Some houses are already painted, and we need to minimize the cost of painting the remaining houses while achieving the target number of neighborhoods.\\n- Identifying Constraints: The houses must be painted with one of 'n' colors. The number of neighborhoods is determined by contiguous houses having the same color. Already painted houses cannot be repainted.\\n- Algorithmic Approach: Dynamic Programming (DP) or Depth-First Search (DFS) with memoization can be used. The state should include the current house index, the number of neighborhoods formed so far, and the color of the last house painted.\\n- Base Cases: If we reach the end of the houses, check if the number of neighborhoods formed is equal to the target. If it is, the cost is 0; otherwise, the cost is infinity (representing an invalid solution).\\n- Recursive Step: If a house is already painted, proceed to the next house, updating the number of neighborhoods if the current house's color is different from the previous house's color. If a house is not painted, try painting it with each of the 'n' colors, recursively compute the cost, and choose the minimum cost among all possible colors.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you define a neighborhood in this problem, and why is it important?\",\n    \"What states would you need to track to implement a dynamic programming or memoization solution effectively?\",\n    \"How do you handle the case where a house is already painted versus when it needs to be painted?\",\n    \"How would you deal with infeasible solutions where you cannot achieve the target number of neighborhoods?\",\n    \"What optimizations or memoization techniques can be applied to improve the efficiency of the solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A neighborhood is defined as a maximal group of continuous houses painted with the same color. It is important because the objective is to achieve exactly the 'target' number of neighborhoods.\",\n    \"The states you need to track include the current house index, the number of neighborhoods formed so far, and the color of the previously painted house. These states are crucial for constructing the recursion and memoizing intermediate results.\",\n    \"If a house is already painted (houses[i] != 0), you simply move to the next house, updating the neighborhood count if the color differs from the previous house. If a house needs to be painted (houses[i] == 0), you iterate through each possible color, compute the cost recursively, and choose the minimum cost.\",\n    \"Infeasible solutions occur when it is impossible to achieve the target number of neighborhoods. This can happen if the number of pre-existing neighborhoods is already greater than the target or when the target is impossible to reach given the existing configuration. You should return -1 (or infinity) in these cases.\",\n    \"Memoization can be used to store the results of intermediate states (house index, number of neighborhoods, and previous color).  Also using lru_cache decorator can help.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
