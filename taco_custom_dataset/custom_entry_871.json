Recognize that the input includes multiple test cases.\\n- Identifying the Pattern: The series represents tetrahedral numbers multiplied by a constant. The series can be expressed as n(n+1)(n+2)/6 where we must adjust the index n. The first element corresponds to n = 0, second to n = 1, and so on.\\n- Edge Cases and Constraints: Notice the constraints on T and N, which should guide the choice of appropriate algorithms and data types. Specifically, handle the edge case where N=1 separately, as it's an exception to the general formula.\\n- Implementing the Solution: Read the number of test cases, loop through each test case, read the integer N, and apply the correct formula. Account for potential errors by using appropriate data types to avoid overflow and type mismatches.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What formula represents the Nth term of the series 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ...? How do we adjust the input N to fit the formula?\",\n    \"Are there any edge cases or special conditions we need to consider when N is small, such as N=1, and how do we handle them differently?\",\n    \"How can you ensure that the calculation doesn't cause an integer overflow given the constraints on N?\",\n    \"The series appears to be related to tetrahedral numbers.  How are tetrahedral numbers defined, and how does that relate to finding the Nth number in the given series?\",\n    \"Given that there are T test cases, how should we structure the code to efficiently process each input and print the corresponding output correctly?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The series follows the formula n(n+1)(n+2)/6. Because the series starts at n = 1, and because the first term is zero, we can set n = N - 2 (when N > 1) to correctly align the input to the formula. When N = 1, the value is zero.\",\n    \"Yes, when N=1, the output is 0. This case needs to be handled separately, using an if/else conditional. Otherwise, n = N - 2 if N > 1.\",\n    \"Since N can be up to 10^4, intermediate calculations might cause an overflow.  Python handles large numbers automatically, however integer division can be an issue. You can perform multiplication before division or explicitly use the `//` operator to get integer results.\",\n    \"Tetrahedral numbers represent the number of objects in a tetrahedron and are calculated as n(n+1)(n+2)/6. The given series aligns with these numbers, with an offset required to the index as the first term is at index 1.\",\n    \"The code should start by reading the value of T (number of test cases) then iterate through each of these test cases reading input (N), computing, and then printing the result.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
