Your task is to find the number of provinces.\\nNote:  A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group. \\nExample 1:\\nInput:\\n[\\n [1, 0, 1],\\n [0, 1, 0],\\n [1, 0, 1]\\n]\\nOutput:\\n2\\nExplanation:\\nThe graph clearly has 2 Provinces [1,3] and [2]. As city 1 and city 3 has a path between them they belong to a single province. City 2 has no path to city 1 or city 3 hence it belongs to another province.\\nExample 2:\\nInput:\\n[\\n [1, 1],\\n [1, 1]\\n]\\nOutput :\\n1\\nYour Task:  \\nYou don't need to read input or print anything.

The `make_adj` function implements this conversion.\\n- Algorithm Selection: Employ Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) to traverse the graph and identify connected components.\\n- Traversal Implementation: Implement a DFS function that explores all vertices reachable from a starting vertex. Mark visited nodes to avoid infinite loops and redundant visits.\\n- Counting Connected Components: Iterate through all vertices, initiating a DFS from each unvisited vertex. Each DFS traversal represents discovering a new province or connected component. Count each initiation of DFS to determine the total number of provinces.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you represent the given graph data and what are the pros and cons of using an adjacency matrix versus an adjacency list?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: Adjacency matrices use a 2D array to represent connections but can be space-inefficient for sparse graphs. Adjacency lists use linked lists or arrays to list adjacent vertices for each vertex, saving space but potentially slower for checking direct connections.\",\n    \"What graph traversal algorithm is suitable for finding connected components, and what are its time and space complexity considerations?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: DFS (Depth First Search) is suitable for finding connected components with a time complexity of O(V+E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges, and a space complexity of O(V) due to the recursion stack.\",\n    \"How can you modify DFS to keep track of visited nodes, and why is this necessary for identifying provinces?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: I can use a boolean array `visited` to mark nodes as visited during DFS. This prevents cycles and ensures each node is processed only once, which is essential for accurately counting provinces without overcounting.\",\n    \"In the context of the problem, what does it mean when DFS is initiated from an unvisited vertex, and how does this increment the province count?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: Starting DFS from an unvisited vertex implies that we've discovered a new connected component (province). Each time DFS is started from such a vertex, it means a new province has been found, and hence, the province count should be incremented.\",\n    \"Can you explain how converting the adjacency matrix to an adjacency list optimizes the process and what considerations should be given to the conversion?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: Converting to an adjacency list allows us to iterate only through the neighbors of each node during DFS, rather than iterating through all possible nodes as we would with an adjacency matrix. This is crucial for sparse graphs where most of the matrix entries are 0, improving both time and space efficiency. During conversion we must ensure that we don't add self loops and we only add an edge once.\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Adjacency matrices use a 2D array to represent connections but can be space-inefficient for sparse graphs.
