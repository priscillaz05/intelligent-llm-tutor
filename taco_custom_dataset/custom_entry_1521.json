There are N Taxis near you, and the position of those taxis is given as an array pos. Where pos[i] denotes the position of the ith taxi. You are also given an array time. Where time[i] denotes the time taken by the ith taxi to cover 1 unit of distance. Your task is to find the minimum time to board a taxi.\\nExample 1:\\nInput:\\nN = 3, cur = 4\\npos = [1, 5, 6]\\ntime = [2, 3, 1]\\nOutput:\\n2\\nExplanation:\\nTotal time taken by the 1st taxi will be: (4-1)*2 = 6\\nTotal time taken by the 2nd taxi will be: (5-4)*3 = 3\\nTotal time taken by the 3rd taxi will be: (6-4)*1 = 2\\nSo, the minimum time will be 2 sec.\\n \\nExample 2:\\nInput:\\nN = 2, cur = 1\\npos = [1, 6]\\ntime = [10, 3]\\nOutput:\\n0\\nExplanation:\\nTotal time taken by the 1st taxi will be: (1-1)*10 = 0\\nTotal time taken by the 2nd taxi will be: (6-1)*3 = 15\\nSo, the minimum time will be 0 sec.\\n \\nYour Task:  \\nYou don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function minimumTime() which takes two integers N and cur, and 2 arrays pos, and time as input parameters and returns the minimum time required to board the taxi.\\nExpected Time Complexity: O(N)\\nExpected Auxiliary Space: O(1)\\nConstraints:\\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^{5}\\n1 \u2264 cur \u2264 10^{5}\\n1 \u2264 pos[i] \u2264 10^{5}\\n1 \u2264 time[i] \u2264 10^{3}\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"from typing import List\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n\\n\\tdef minimumTime(self, N: int, cur: int, pos: List[int], time: List[int]) -> int:\\n\\t\\tq = []\\n\\t\\tfor i in range(len(pos)):\\n\\t\\t\\tq.append(abs(pos[i] - cur) * time[i])\\n\\t\\treturn min(q)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The goal is to find the minimum time it takes to board a taxi out of N available taxis, given their positions and the time they take to travel one unit distance.\\n- Calculating Travel Time: For each taxi, calculate the absolute distance between the current position and the taxi's position. Multiply this distance by the time the taxi takes to cover one unit.\\n- Finding the Minimum Time: Iterate through the calculated travel times for each taxi and return the minimum travel time.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you calculate the time taken by each taxi to reach the current position?\",\n    \"What data structure would be suitable to store the time taken by each taxi?\",\n    \"What is the time complexity of your proposed solution and how does it align with the problem constraints?\",\n    \"Are there any edge cases to consider in this problem?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Multiply the absolute difference between the taxi's position and the current position by the time the taxi takes to cover one unit of distance: abs(taxi_position - current_position) * time_per_unit.\",\n    \"A simple list or array would suffice to store the time taken by each taxi.\",\n    \"The time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of taxis, because you need to calculate the time for each taxi.
