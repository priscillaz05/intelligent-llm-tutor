If multiple pairs have the same minimum difference, all such pairs should be returned.\\n- Sorting: Recognize that sorting the array simplifies finding the minimum difference, as the closest numbers will be adjacent after sorting.\\n- Iterating and Comparing: After sorting, iterate through adjacent elements to compute the absolute difference and keep track of the minimum difference encountered so far.\\n- Handling Multiple Pairs: Store the pairs that exhibit the minimum difference. If a smaller difference is found, clear the stored pairs and start a new collection. If the current difference matches the minimum, add the corresponding pair to the stored pairs.\\n- Data Structures and Output: Use a string or a list to store the pairs and then convert the list to the correct format.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Why is sorting the input array the most efficient first step for this problem?\",\n    \"How does maintaining a minimum difference variable help in identifying all pairs with the smallest difference?\",\n    \"What should you do if you encounter a difference that's smaller than the current minimum difference?\",\n    \"How should you handle the edge case where all elements in the array are the same?\",\n    \"What is the most space-efficient way to store the resulting pairs?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Sorting ensures that numbers closest in value are adjacent to each other, reducing the number of comparisons needed to find the minimum absolute difference.\",\n    \"It helps to identify and store only those pairs of numbers that exhibit the smallest absolute difference, discarding those with larger differences.\",\n    \"You should clear the currently stored pairs, update the minimum difference, and start storing only the new pair (or pairs) with the smaller difference.\",\n    \"If all elements are the same, the minimum difference is 0, and every adjacent pair satisfies the condition.
