The format of the ad should be like this:\\n\\nThere are space-separated non-empty words of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.\\n\\nThere are hyphen characters '-' in some words, their positions set word wrapping points. Word can include more than one hyphen. \\n\\nIt is guaranteed that there are no adjacent spaces and no adjacent hyphens. No hyphen is adjacent to space. There are no spaces and no hyphens before the first word and after the last word. \\n\\nWhen the word is wrapped, the part of the word before hyphen and the hyphen itself stay on current line and the next part of the word is put on the next line. You can also put line break between two words, in that case the space stays on current line. Check notes for better understanding.\\n\\nThe ad can occupy no more that k lines and should have minimal width. The width of the ad is the maximal length of string (letters, spaces and hyphens are counted) in it.\\n\\nYou should write a program that will find minimal width of the ad.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains number k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5).\\n\\nThe second line contains the text of the ad \u2014 non-empty space-separated words of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and hyphens.

Note that words can be split at hyphens and that spaces are considered part of the current line.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Be aware of the edge cases, such as when the ad can fit on a single line, the length of very long words, the minimum possible width is at least the length of the longest word and the role of spaces and hyphens in determining the length of the lines.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy:  Since we are looking for minimizing the maximum value (width), binary search is a good strategy. Binary search on the possible widths. The lower bound would be the length of the longest word and the upper bound would be the total length of all words plus spaces.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Carefully handle the split of the input string into words and word parts (delimited by hyphens or spaces). Determine the number of lines needed for a given width. Handle edge cases carefully to avoid off-by-one errors.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the objective of the problem, and what constraints should be considered?\",\n    \"How should the presence of hyphens and spaces be handled while calculating the width of a line?\",\n    \"What would be an efficient search algorithm to find the minimum possible width, given the constraints?\",\n    \"How can the number of lines needed for a given width be determined?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases that must be handled, and how might they affect the search range?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The objective is to minimize the maximum width of the lines in the ad, subject to a constraint on the maximum number of lines (k).\",\n    \"Hyphens represent possible split points. When a word is split, the part of the word before the hyphen stays on the current line, including the hyphen itself. Spaces stay on the current line.\",\n    \"Binary search is appropriate since we are looking for the minimum of a maximum value (width). We can search over the range of possible widths.\",\n    \"Iterate through the words and word parts, adding their lengths to the current line's length. If adding a word part exceeds the allowed width, increment the line count and start a new line with the current word part.\",\n    \"Edge cases include the case when ad can be fit in one line (return the total length of the add), and when one word is very long.
