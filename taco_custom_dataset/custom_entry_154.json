The goal is to determine the minimum number of character changes required to make a given substring beautiful, where changes must be to one of the first 3 lowercase Latin letters ('a', 'b', 'c').\\n- Identifying Key Constraints: The input string consists only of 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Queries involve substrings defined by start and end indices (l, r). The task is to minimize the number of changes.\\n- Devising a Strategy: Since beautiful strings avoid palindromes of length >= 2, they essentially alternate characters. Consider all 6 possible permutations of 'a', 'b', 'c' as the alternating pattern. For each query, compare the substring to each permutation, compute the number of changes needed for each, and take the minimum.\\n- Optimizing Calculation:  Precompute cumulative sums of differences between the string and each permutation. This lets us calculate the cost of a substring in O(1) time for each permutation, and therefore O(1) overall since there are a constant number of permutations.\\n- Implementation Details: The input indices are 1-based, so we need to convert to 0-based indices for array access.  Use `itertools.permutations` to generate all possible patterns. Accumulate costs of differences by comparing with the precomputed permutations, storing the minimum such cost for each query.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the characteristics of a 'beautiful' string as defined in the problem, and how does this constraint simplify the possible solutions?\",\n    \"Since only the first three letters of the alphabet are allowed, how might you take advantage of this constraint to generate all possible beautiful strings?\",\n    \"Given a substring and a possible 'beautiful' string, how can you efficiently calculate the number of changes needed to transform the substring into that 'beautiful' string?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently compute the cost for multiple queries on the same initial string without redundant calculations?\",\n    \"What is the role of precomputation in optimizing the solution's time complexity, and what specifically should be precomputed?\",\n    \"How do you handle the 1-based indexing in the queries when accessing array elements, which usually use 0-based indexing?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A 'beautiful' string doesn't have palindromic substrings of length at least 2, meaning adjacent characters must be different. This implies the string has to follow an alternating pattern. This simplifies solutions by reducing the number of cases needed to consider.\",\n    \"Since only 'a', 'b', and 'c' are allowed, and the string must alternate characters, the possible 'beautiful' strings can be generated from all permutations of 'abc'.
