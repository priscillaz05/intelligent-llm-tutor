Rectangles are defined by their top-left and bottom-right corners. Overlap includes sharing a side.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Consider edge cases where rectangles are adjacent (sharing a side). Misunderstanding the coordinate system can lead to incorrect logic.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Establish the non-overlapping conditions. Overlap exists if the rectangles do not satisfy *any* of the non-overlap conditions.\\n- Implementing Efficient Checks: Ensure the checks are simple comparisons to meet O(1) time complexity.
