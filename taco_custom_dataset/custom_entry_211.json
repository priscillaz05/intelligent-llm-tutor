(i.e. change 0 to 1 and 1 to 0) Find if it is possible to convert S to a palindrome by applying the above operation any (possibly zero) number of times. Note: A string is called a palindrome if it reads the same backwards and forwards, for e.g. 10001 and 0110 are palindromic strings. Input Format: The first line contains a single integer T \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains an integer N \u2014 the length of the binary string S. The second line of each test case contains a binary string S of length N containing 0s and 1s only. Output Format: For each test case, output YES if it is possible to convert S to a palindrome. Otherwise, output NO. Constraints: $1 \u2264 T \u2264 10^{5}$, $1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^{5}$, $S$ contains $0$ and $1$ only. Sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\\\cdot 10^{5}$.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"for i in range(int(input())):\\n\\tn = int(input())\\n\\ts = input()\\n\\tz = 0\\n\\to = 0\\n\\tfor i in s:\\n\\t\\tif i == '0':\\n\\t\\t\\tz += 1\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\to += 1\\n\\tif z % 2 != 0 and o % 2 != 0:\\n\\t\\tprint('NO')\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tprint('YES')\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem asks whether a binary string can be converted to a palindrome by flipping pairs of bits. The core idea is to determine the conditions under which a binary string can be transformed into a palindrome through these flips.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints: The key constraint is that we can only flip bits in pairs. This implies that we need to analyze the counts of 0s and 1s in the string to understand if the string can be rearranged to form a palindrome.\\n- Developing an Algorithmic Approach: If the number of 0s and 1s are both even or both odd, then it's possible to make the string a palindrome. If one of them is odd, and the other is even, it's impossible. To prove that, if both the count of 0s and 1s are even, it's always possible to convert to a palindrome. If the count of 0s and 1s is odd, it's still possible to convert to a palindrome since the character at the center of the palindrome doesn't need to match with any other character. However, if one of the counts is odd and the other is even, then it is not possible to construct a palindrome because there are different counts of '1' and '0' which are not even, and it's impossible to make them even in pairs.\\n- Edge Cases and Simplifications: No specific edge cases are present, the only check needed is if the counts are both even or both odd. If both counts are even, any arrangement would do. If both counts are odd, the arrangement is possible too.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What conditions must be met regarding the counts of 0s and 1s to determine if the string can be converted to a palindrome?\",\n    \"If both the count of 0s and the count of 1s are even, is it always possible to create a palindrome?\",\n    \"If both the count of 0s and the count of 1s are odd, is it possible to create a palindrome, and how?\",\n    \"What if one count (0s or 1s) is odd and the other is even?

The fundamental determination hinges solely on whether the counts of 0s and 1s are both even or both odd to ensure a palindrome can be formed.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
