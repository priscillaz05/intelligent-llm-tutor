Acknowledge potential issues related to large input strings and optimize to meet time complexity O(256*N).\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Employ a sliding window technique to efficiently traverse the string. Use a dictionary (or hash map) to keep track of character frequencies in the current window. Expand the window until it contains all distinct characters, then contract it from the left to find the smallest possible window.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Manage the window's start and end indices. Update the dictionary to reflect character counts. Handle cases where a character goes out of the window by decrementing its count. Maintain a count of distinct characters still needed to be included in the window.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean to find the smallest window containing all distinct characters, and how does this differ from finding any substring with all distinct characters?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: The 'smallest window' implies finding the substring with the minimum length that satisfies the condition of having all distinct characters present at least once. Finding any substring might give a longer result.\",\n    \"How would you handle edge cases, such as an empty string or a string that contains only repeating characters?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: For an empty string, the length of the smallest window should be 0. For a string with only repeating characters, the smallest window would be of length 1, consisting of the single distinct character.\",\n    \"Can you suggest a data structure to efficiently keep track of the frequency of characters in the sliding window and why is it appropriate for this problem?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: A dictionary (or hash map) is suitable because it provides O(1) access to the frequency of each character, allowing for efficient updates as the window slides.\",\n    \"How do you determine when a window contains all the distinct characters from the string?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: Maintain a separate count of distinct characters needed. When this count becomes 0, it means all distinct characters are present in the current window.\",\n    \"How do you efficiently reduce the window size from the left while ensuring the window still contains all distinct characters?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: Reduce the window by incrementing the left pointer. Before each increment, decrement the character count in the dictionary for the character being removed from the window. If the count becomes zero, it implies that one of the required distinct characters is now missing, so the process stops.\",\n        \"What is the time complexity of this approach and how does the use of a dictionary impact the time complexity?\",\n        \"Expected Answer: The time complexity is O(N) where N is the length of the string because in the worst case each character will be visited twice (once when the window expands and once when it contracts).
