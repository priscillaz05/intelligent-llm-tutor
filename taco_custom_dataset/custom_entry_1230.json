The cost is the sum of the increments needed to make a selected element greater than the preceding highest element.\\n- Generating Subsets: The key idea is to iterate through all possible subsets of size K and calculate the cost for each subset.\\n- Calculating Cost: For each subset, determine the cost required to make the selected elements increasing by incrementing elements as necessary.

Iterate from 1 to 2^N - 1.  The binary representation of each number represents a subset, where a '1' at the i-th position indicates that the i-th element is included in the subset.  We select only the subsets with exactly K elements by counting the number of 1s in the bitmask.\",\n    \"Iterate through the selected elements, keeping track of the highest element seen so far. If a current selected element is less than or equal to the highest element, calculate the difference needed to increment it to be strictly greater than the highest element. Add the incremented value to the cost, and update the highest value. If the current element is already greater than the highest value, update highest with the current element, without adding to cost.\",\n    \"The cost will be added when a subsequent selected element is smaller or equal to the current highest value. Thus, we just need to check if the current selected element is greater than highest. If not, point = highest - A[j] + 1, where A[j] is the subsequent element that violates the increasing requirement.\",\n    \"Initialize minimum cost to infinity. After computing the cost for each subset, compare it with the current minimum cost and update if the current subset cost is smaller.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
