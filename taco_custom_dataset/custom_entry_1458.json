Each year consists of 10 months, from month 1 through month 10, and starts from a big month. A common year shall start with a big month, followed by small months and big months one after another. Therefore the first month is a big month, the second month is a small month, the third a big month, ..., and the 10th and last month a small one. A big month consists of 20 days and a small month consists of 19 days. However years which are multiples of three, that are year 3, year 6, year 9, and so on, shall consist of 10 big months and no small month.\\\" \\n\\nMany years have passed since the calendar started to be used. For celebration of the millennium day (the year 1000, month 1, day 1), a royal lottery is going to be organized to send gifts to those who have lived as many days as the number chosen by the lottery. Write a program that helps people calculate the number of days since their birthdate to the millennium day.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe input is formatted as follows.\\n\\n> n\\n>  Y1 M1 D1\\n>  Y2 M2 D2\\n>  ...\\n>  Yn Mn Dn\\n\\nHere, the first line gives the number of datasets as a positive integer n, which is less than or equal to 100. It is followed by n datasets. Each dataset is formatted in a line and gives three positive integers, Yi (< 1000), Mi (\u2264 10), and Di (\u2264 20), that correspond to the year, month and day, respectively, of a person's birthdate in the king's calendar. These three numbers are separated by a space.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nFor the birthdate specified in each dataset, print in a line the number of days from the birthdate, inclusive, to the millennium day, exclusive.

Months alternate between big (20 days) and small (19 days), except for years divisible by 3, which have 10 big months.\\n- Calculating Days in a Year: Regular years have 5 big and 5 small months, totaling (5 * 20) + (5 * 19) = 195 days. Years divisible by 3 have 10 big months, totaling 200 days. The millennium day is year 1000, month 1, day 1.\\n- Calculating Days up to the Millennium: We need to calculate the total number of days from year 1, month 1, day 1, up to the day before year 1000, month 1, day 1. This total is (999 * 195) + (999 // 3 * 5) = 194805 + 1665 = 196470 days for complete years.\\n- Days in the Millennium Year: The millennium target date is the first day of year 1000. So we calculate the number of days for any given birthdate up to (but not including) the millennium date. Millennium day itself is 196470 (years) + 0 (months) + 1 (day) = 196471 days from the start of the calendar.\\n- Calculating Days from Birthdate: Calculate the number of days from the beginning of the calendar to the given birthdate. Subtract that from the total days to the millennium date (196471) to get the days until the millennium day.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How many days are there in a typical year in this calendar system?\",\n    \"How does a year divisible by 3 differ from a typical year in terms of its calendar structure?\",\n    \"How can you calculate the total number of days from the start of the calendar to the millennium day (year 1000, month 1, day 1)?\",\n    \"How would you calculate the number of days from the start of the calendar to a specific birthdate (Y, M, D)?\",\n    \"Given the total days to the millennium and the days to the birthdate, how can you determine the number of days between the birthdate and the millennium day?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A typical year has 5 big months (20 days each) and 5 small months (19 days each), resulting in (5 * 20) + (5 * 19) = 195 days.\",\n    \"A year divisible by 3 consists of 10 big months (20 days each) and no small months, for a total of 200 days.\",\n    \"You can calculate the days in each year then sum the days. Which is (number of regular years * 195) + (number of years divisible by 3 * 200). For years up to year 1000 is (999 * 195) + (999 // 3 * 5) = 194805 + 1665 = 196470.\",\n    \"Calculate the number of days from the start of the calendar to the beginning of the birth year (Y). Then, calculate the number of days from the beginning of the birth year to the beginning of the birth month (M). Finally, add the birth day (D). Summing those values gives the number of days to the birthdate.\",\n    \"Subtract the number of days from the start of the calendar to the birthdate from the total days to the millennium day. Add 1 because it is inclusive from the start to birthdate and exclude the day of millennium day.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
