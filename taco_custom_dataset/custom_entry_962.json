We need to return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.\\n- Data Structures: The tree can be represented using an adjacency list. Also, we can use dynamic programming to solve this efficiently, storing the number of ways to color a subtree rooted at a node, considering the node is colored black or white.\\n- Algorithm Selection: A suitable approach is dynamic programming combined with depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to traverse the tree. The core idea is to calculate the number of valid colorings for each subtree. For each node, we maintain two counts: the number of ways to color the subtree rooted at that node when the node is colored white and the number of ways when the node is colored black.\\n- Base Case: For leaf nodes, both counts are initialized to 1, representing a single way to color the node black or white.\\n- Transition: During DFS or BFS, compute the black and white counts based on the children of each node. If a node is colored white, its children can be either black or white. If a node is colored black, its children must be white.\\n- Modulo Arithmetic: Ensure to use modulo operation after each multiplication to prevent overflow, according to the problem's constraint.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can we represent the tree structure in a program?\",\n    \"How can Dynamic Programming be applied to calculate the number of possible colorings?\",\n    \"What are the base cases for the DP solution?\",\n    \"How does the modulo operation affect the calculation and why is it important?\",\n    \"What is the time complexity of the proposed solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The tree can be represented using an adjacency list or an adjacency matrix. An adjacency list is generally preferred for trees because it uses less memory.\",\n    \"Dynamic Programming can be used to store the number of ways to color each subtree when its root is colored black or white. This allows us to build solutions from the bottom up.\",\n    \"The base cases for DP are the leaf nodes. For each leaf node, there is one way to color it black and one way to color it white.\",\n    \"The modulo operation ensures that the result remains within the specified range (10^9 + 7). It is applied after each multiplication to avoid integer overflow.\",\n    \"The time complexity of the solution is O(N), where N is the number of vertices. This is because we visit each node once during the depth-first search or breadth-first search.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
