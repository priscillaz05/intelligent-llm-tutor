For simplicity, the columns are represented as vertical segments; for each valid $i$, the height of the $i$-th segment is $H_i$.\\n- Ada assigns a column to each of the points $X_1, X_2, \\\\ldots, X_N$ in an arbitrary way (each column must be assigned to exactly one point).\\n- Finally, Ada constructs the roof of the restaurant, represented by a polyline with $N$ vertices. Let's denote the column assigned to the $i$-th point by $P_i$. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these vertices is $(X_i, H_{P_i})$, i.e. the polyline joins the tops of the columns from left to right.\\nAda wants the biggest restaurant. Help her choose the positions of the columns in such a way that the area below the roof is the biggest possible. Formally, she wants to maximise the area of the polygon whose perimeter is formed by the roof and the segments $(X_N, H_{P_N}) - (X_N, 0) - (X_1, 0) - (X_1, H_{P_1})$.

Each column has a height H_i and is placed at a point X_i on the x-axis. The goal is to find the optimal assignment of columns to points to maximize the area.\\n- Identifying Key Insight: Realize that the area is maximized when taller columns are placed where the distances between x-coordinates are larger. This is because the area is essentially a sum of trapezoids (or triangles) formed by adjacent columns, and the area of a trapezoid depends on the height of the two columns and the distance between them.\\n- Devising a Strategy: The optimal strategy is to sort the column heights and the distances between adjacent x-coordinates. Then, assign the tallest column to the largest distance, the second tallest column to the second largest distance, and so on. This ensures that the overall area is maximized.\\n- Calculating Distances: The distance between each adjacent pair of X coordinates (X[i+1] - X[i]) contributes to the base of 2 trapezoids, except for the first and last points which only contribute to 1 trapezoid.\\n- Implementing the Solution: Read the input, calculate distances, sort heights and effective distances, and then multiply the sorted lists to generate the answer.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How is the area under the roof polyline calculated, and what geometric shapes contribute to it?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: The area is calculated as the sum of trapezoids (or triangles if one height is zero) formed between adjacent columns.
