Understand that triangulation means dividing the polygon into triangles with vertices from the polygon, such that the triangles do not overlap and cover the entire area of the polygon. The weight of a triangulation is the sum of the products of the vertex labels of each triangle.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: This looks like a dynamic programming problem. We are trying to find the minimum weight, suggesting an optimization problem. A recursive approach with memoization can efficiently solve this kind of problem. Consider the edges to define the subproblems.\\n- Implementing the dynamic programming approach: Create a DP table to store the minimum triangulation weights for sub-polygons. The sub-polygons are defined by their start and end vertices. Iterate through sub-polygon sizes, calculating and storing the minimum weight for each sub-polygon in the DP table. Consider base cases such as a triangle. \\n- Mathematical Optimization / Simplification: After examining the pattern for n = 3, 4, 5, we can observe the pattern that produces the optimal triangulation weight. The optimal solution is given by the formula: 2 * (n - 2) + 3 * ((n - 2) * (n - 1) // 2) + (n - 2) * (n - 1) * (2 * n - 3) // 6\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does triangulation of a polygon mean, and what properties must the triangles satisfy?\",\n    \"How can dynamic programming be used to solve this optimization problem, and what are the subproblems?\",\n    \"What are the base cases for the dynamic programming approach, and how do they initialize the DP table?\",\n    \"Is there a direct formula to calculate the minimum weight triangulation for a given polygon with n vertices?\",\n    \"What is the time complexity of the dynamic programming solution, and how can we optimize it if possible?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Triangulation is dividing the polygon into triangles that use only vertices of the original polygon.
