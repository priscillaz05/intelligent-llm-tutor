"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"Once upon a time in the Kingdom of Far Far Away lived Sir Lancelot, the chief Royal General. He was very proud of his men and he liked to invite the King to come and watch drill exercises which demonstrated the fighting techniques and tactics of the squad he was in charge of. But time went by and one day Sir Lancelot had a major argument with the Fairy Godmother (there were rumors that the argument occurred after the general spoke badly of the Godmother's flying techniques. That seemed to hurt the Fairy Godmother very deeply). \\n\\nAs the result of the argument, the Godmother put a rather strange curse upon the general. It sounded all complicated and quite harmless: \\\"If the squared distance between some two soldiers equals to 5, then those soldiers will conflict with each other!\\\"\\n\\nThe drill exercises are held on a rectangular n \u00d7 m field, split into nm square 1 \u00d7 1 segments for each soldier. Thus, the square of the distance between the soldiers that stand on squares (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) equals exactly (x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2. Now not all nm squad soldiers can participate in the drill exercises as it was before the Fairy Godmother's curse. Unless, of course, the general wants the soldiers to fight with each other or even worse... For example, if he puts a soldier in the square (2, 2), then he cannot put soldiers in the squares (1, 4), (3, 4), (4, 1) and (4, 3) \u2014 each of them will conflict with the soldier in the square (2, 2).\\n\\nYour task is to help the general. You are given the size of the drill exercise field. You are asked to calculate the maximum number of soldiers that can be simultaneously positioned on this field, so that no two soldiers fall under the Fairy Godmother's curse.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe single line contains space-separated integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000) that represent the size of the drill exercise field.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nPrint the desired maximum number of warriors.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nInput\\n\\n2 4\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n4\\n\\nInput\\n\\n3 4\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n6\\n\\nNote\\n\\nIn the first sample test Sir Lancelot can place his 4 soldiers on the 2 \u00d7 4 court as follows (the soldiers' locations are marked with gray circles on the scheme):\\n\\n<image>\\n\\nIn the second sample test he can place 6 soldiers on the 3 \u00d7 4 site in the following manner:\\n\\n<image>\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"(n, m) = map(int, input().split())\\nif n > m:\\n\\t(n, m) = (m, n)\\nif n > 2 and m > 2:\\n\\tprint((n * m + 1) // 2)\\nelif n == 1:\\n\\tprint(m)\\nelse:\\n\\tprint(2 * (m // 4 * 2 + min(m % 4, 2)))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem describes a scenario where soldiers on a rectangular grid conflict if the squared distance between them is 5. The goal is to maximize the number of soldiers placed on the grid without any conflicts.\\n- Identifying Conflict Condition: The key is to understand that (x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2 = 5. This implies that the absolute difference in x coordinates and y coordinates must be such that their squares add up to 5.  The only integer solutions for this are differences of 1 and 2 (since 1^2 + 2^2 = 5).\\n- Recognizing Grid Patterns: The problem can be solved by strategically placing soldiers. Observe that a chessboard-like pattern can maximize the number of soldiers.  However, the solution approach varies based on grid size (n and m).\\n- Handling Different Cases:  If one of the dimensions is 1, all squares can be occupied. For larger grids, placing soldiers in alternating squares like a chessboard is optimal, or more nuanced arrangements depending on size.\\n- Applying Formulae/Logic for Specific Cases: If both dimensions are greater than 2, a chessboard pattern is optimal, and approximately half the squares can be occupied.  Special handling is needed for n=2. In the case n=2, the optimal arrangement repeats after every 4 columns. Thus the calculation is done by considering repeating groups of 4 columns.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does the squared distance formula (x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2 = 5 relate to the possible movements or placements of soldiers that would cause a conflict?\",\n    \"How would you approach placing soldiers to maximize the count while avoiding conflicts, especially considering the squared distance constraint?\",\n    \"Are there specific grid sizes (n and m values) that might require a different approach or formula for calculating the maximum number of soldiers?\",\n    \"In the case where n=2, how the dimensions affects the optimal placement to maximize the number of warriors?\",\n    \"Why chessboard placement is an effective strategy for maximizing the soldier count in the general case, and are there any exceptions or scenarios where it might not be optimal?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The formula implies that if two soldiers are positioned such that the squared difference of their x-coordinates plus the squared difference of their y-coordinates equals 5, they will conflict. Thus the (dx, dy) = (1,2) or (2,1).\",\n    \"One approach is to visualize a chessboard pattern and try to place soldiers on alternating squares. Also consider that a soldier placed at some (x, y) will conflict with soldiers placed at (x+1, y+2), (x-1, y+2), (x+1, y-2), (x-1, y-2), (x+2, y+1), (x-2, y+1), (x+2, y-1) and (x-2, y-1).\",\n    \"Yes, if either n or m is 1, then all squares can be filled. If n = 2, then the optimal solution requires a different calculation based on how many 2x4 blocks can fit. If n and m are larger than 2, the chessboard pattern gives a solution of approximately n*m/2.\",\n    \"The optimal solution repeats every 4 columns. Thus, you can compute groups of 4 columns by multiplying the number of blocks of 4 with the appropriate number of soldiers, and consider the modulo of m%4.\",\n    \"A chessboard placement strategy aims to minimize the conflicts based on (x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2 = 5. Soldiers are placed such that the distances don't add up to root5. One case would be when n or m is equal to 1, chessboard strategy is not neccessary.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
