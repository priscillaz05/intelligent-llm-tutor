Vlad gets everything else.\\n- Prioritize the categories: IT > chemistry > design > other. This means checking for 'bug' first, then 'boom', then 'edits', and finally assigning to Vlad if none of the others match.\\n- Handle case-insensitivity: The keywords should be matched regardless of case.\\n- Consider partial matches and order: The keyword letters must appear in the specified order but can have other characters in between.\\n- Return the correct person's name as a string.\\n- Edge cases: If the meme contains letters from multiple memes, pick the meme based on the earliest possible letters.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How should I handle the case-insensitive keyword matching?\",\n    \"What data structure should I use to store the keywords and their corresponding persons?\",\n    \"How should I implement the priority system for matching memes?\",\n    \"How can I ensure that the letters of keywords appear in the correct order even if they are not consecutive?\",\n    \"How should I handle edge cases where a meme might match multiple categories, and which category should take precedence?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Use regular expressions with the `re.IGNORECASE` flag, or convert the meme and keywords to lowercase before comparison.\",\n    \"A list of tuples, where each tuple contains a regular expression pattern and the corresponding person's name (e.g., `[('bug', 'Roma'), ('boom', 'Maxim'), ('edits', 'Danik')]`).\",\n    \"Iterate through the list of keywords in the specified order (IT, chemistry, design).
