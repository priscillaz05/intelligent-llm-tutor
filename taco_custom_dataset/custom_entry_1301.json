The goal is to find the minimum and maximum number of distinct edge weights (f) in a valid assignment.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints: The XOR sum of edge weights between any two leaves must be 0. This constraint heavily restricts the possible assignments.\\n- Devising a Solution Strategy: The minimum distinct weights occur when all edge weights are the same. The maximum distinct weights likely depend on the tree's structure. We need to consider the parity of path lengths between leaves and how to use XOR to make the sums zero.\\n- Minimum f Value: If all leaves are at the same distance parity from an arbitrary node, we can assign the same weight to all edges, resulting in f = 1.\\n- Maximum f Value: If there are leaves at different distance parities from an arbitrary node, we need at least two distinct edge weights. We can attempt to maximize the distinct edge weights. A key observation is that if two leaves v1 and v2 have a path with XOR sum 0, then any other leaf v3 must have a path to both v1 and v2 that also has XOR sum 0. This significantly constrains the choices.\\n- Special Cases and Edge Cases: Consider star graphs, where all leaves connect to a central node. In this case, the number of distinct edge weights required will be equal to the number of leaves around a central node, or maybe less.\\n- Code Implementation Strategy: First read input and build the graph using adjancency list. find the leaves. To calculate the minimum number of distinct edge weights, we can perform a BFS (Breadth-First Search) from any node (e.g., node 1) and check if all leaves are at the same parity distance. To calculate the maximum possible number of distinct weights we can subtract number of leaf parent with more than or equal to two leaves connected to same parent from total number of edges.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the key constraints for assigning edge weights in the tree to ensure the XOR sum condition holds?\",\n    \"How can we determine the minimum possible value of 'f' (number of distinct edge weights)?
