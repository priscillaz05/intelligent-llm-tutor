If Marc has eaten $j$ cupcakes so far, after eating a cupcake with $\\\\textbf{C}$ calories he must walk at least $2^j\\\\times c$  miles to maintain his weight.\\n\\nExample \\n\\n$calorie=[5,10,7]$   \\n\\nIf he eats the cupcakes in the order shown, the miles he will need to walk are $(2^0\\\\times5)+(2^1\\\\times10)+(2^2\\\\times7)=5+20+28=53$.  This is not the minimum, though, so we need to test other orders of consumption.  In this case, our minimum miles is calculated as $(2^0\\\\times10)+(2^1\\\\times7)+(2^2\\\\times5)=10+14+20=44$.\\n\\nGiven the individual calorie counts for each of the cupcakes, determine the minimum number of miles Marc must walk to maintain his weight.

He can minimize $miles$ by eating the $n=3$ cupcakes in the following order: \\n\\nEat the cupcake with $c_1=3$ calories, so $miles=0+(3\\\\cdot2^0)=3$.\\nEat the cupcake with $c_2=2$ calories, so $miles=3+(2\\\\cdot2^1)=7$.\\nEat the cupcake with $c_{0}=1$ calories, so $miles=7+(1\\\\cdot2^2)=11$.\\n\\nWe then print the final value of $miles$, which is $\\\\mbox{11}$, as our answer.\\n\\nSample Input 1\\n4\\n7 4 9 6\\n\\nSample Output 1\\n79\\n\\nExplanation 1\\n\\n$(2^0*9)+(2^1*7)+(2^2*6)+(2^3*4)=9+14+24+32=79$\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import sys\\nn = int(input().strip())\\ncalories = list(map(int, input().strip().split(' '))))\\ncalories.sort(reverse=True)\\nprint(sum([2 ** j * calories[j] for j in range(n)]))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires minimizing the total miles Marc needs to walk, where the miles for each cupcake is calculated as $2^j * c$, where $j$ is the number of cupcakes eaten so far and $c$ is the calorie count of the current cupcake. The key is to find the optimal order to eat the cupcakes.\\n- Strategy for Minimization: To minimize the total miles, cupcakes with higher calorie counts should be eaten earlier because the multiplier $2^j$ increases with $j$. This suggests sorting the cupcakes in descending order of calorie count.\\n- Algorithm Implementation: Sort the calorie counts in descending order. Then, iterate through the sorted calorie counts, calculate the miles for each cupcake as $2^j * calorie[j]$, and sum these miles to get the total minimum miles.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does the order in which Marc eats the cupcakes affect the total miles he needs to walk?\",\n    \"Why is it beneficial to eat the higher calorie cupcakes earlier in the process?\",\n    \"What data structure or method can be used to efficiently sort the calorie counts?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the total miles walked after determining the optimal order of cupcake consumption?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The order significantly affects the total miles because the calorie count of each cupcake is multiplied by $2^j$, where $j$ is the number of cupcakes already eaten. Eating higher-calorie cupcakes later increases the total miles significantly.\",\n    \"Eating higher-calorie cupcakes earlier minimizes the overall miles because the multiplier $2^j$ is smaller for smaller values of $j$.\",\n    \"The calorie counts can be efficiently sorted using sorting algorithms such as merge sort, quicksort, or simply using the built-in sort function in the programming language (e.g., `sort()` in Python or `Arrays.sort()` in Java).\",\n    \"After sorting the calorie counts in descending order, you can iterate through the sorted list. For each cupcake at index $j$, calculate $2^j * calorie[j]$ and add it to the total miles. The sum of these values will be the minimum total miles Marc needs to walk.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
