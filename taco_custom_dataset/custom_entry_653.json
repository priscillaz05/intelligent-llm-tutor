You know that a single bus emits X units of smoke while a single car emits Y units of smoke in their journey from A to B.\\n\\nYou want to arrange some buses and cars to carry all these N people such that total smoke emitted is minimized. Output the minimized smoke value.\\n\\n------ Input Format ------ \\n\\n- First line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\\n- Each test case contains three integers N, X, Y - the number of people who want to travel, the units of smoke emitted by a bus and the units of smoke emitted by a car respectively.\\n\\n------ Output Format ------ \\n\\nFor each test case, output the minimum units of smoke emitted in transporting the N people.\\n\\n------ Constraints ------ \\n\\n$1 \u2264 T \u2264 1000$\\n$1 \u2264 N \u2264 1000$\\n$1 \u2264 X, Y \u2264 1000\\n\\n----- Sample Input 1 ------ \\n3\\n9 40 8\\n15 20 20\\n105 80 10\\n\\n----- Sample Output 1 ------ \\n24\\n20\\n100\\n\\n----- explanation 1 ------ \\nTest case-1: In the optimal case, we will use $3$ cars where the $1$-st and $2$-nd car will carry $4$ people each and the $3$-rd car will carry $1$ person.\\n\\nTherefore smoke emitted $= 3 \\\\times 8 = 24$ units. \\n\\nTest case-2: In the optimal case, we will use $1$ bus to carry all the $15$ people.\\n\\nTherefore smoke emitted $= 1 \\\\times 20 = 20$ units.\\n\\nTest case-3: In the optimal case, we will use $1$ bus to carry $100$ people and use $2$ cars to carry the remaining $5$ people.\\n\\nTherefore smoke emitted $= 1 \\\\times 80 + 2 \\\\times 10 = 100$ units.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"from math import ceil\\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\\n\\t(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())\\n\\tprint(min(ceil(n / 4) * b, n // 100 * a + ceil(n % 100 / 4) * b, ceil(n / 100) * a))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding Problem Constraints: Recognize that the goal is to minimize smoke emissions by selecting the optimal combination of buses and cars. Note the capacity of each vehicle type (100 for buses, 4 for cars) and their respective smoke emission rates (X for buses, Y for cars).\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Consider the case where using only cars is more efficient than using buses, or vice versa. Acknowledge the possibility of needing a combination of both vehicle types.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Compare the smoke emission of transporting all people by bus, all people by car, and a combination of both. Determine how to calculate the number of vehicles required and the total smoke emitted for each option.\\n- Implementing Cost Comparison: Account for integer division and the possibility of needing extra cars/buses to accommodate all people.
