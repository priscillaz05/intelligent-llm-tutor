Initialize a set with 0 (representing the empty subset). Iterate through each number in the input set, and for each number, add it to all the sums already in the set, adding the new sums to the set as well.  This ensures we consider all combinations of numbers.\\n- Implement and Optimize: Use a set to store the distinct sums, which automatically handles duplicates. After processing all numbers, convert the set to a sorted list and return it to satisfy the requirement of returning an increasing order list.\\n- Efficiency Considerations: This approach avoids redundant calculations and efficiently stores distinct sums. The time complexity is O(n * sum), where n is the number of elements in the array and sum is the sum of all elements. Space complexity is also O(n * sum), for storing the distinct sums in the set.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the significance of including 0 in the initial set of possible sums?\",\n    \"How does the dynamic programming or set based approach ensure all possible subset sums are considered?\",\n    \"Why is a set data structure suitable for storing the distinct sums during the calculation?\",\n    \"How does the complexity of this approach relate to the input size and the sum of input elements?\",\n    \"How does converting the set of sums to a sorted list fulfill the problem's output requirements?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Including 0 initially accounts for the empty subset, which always has a sum of 0, and it's necessary to include this as a possible sum.\",\n    \"By iterating through each number in the input and adding it to all existing sums, we effectively explore all possible combinations of numbers, ensuring we generate all possible subset sums.\",\n    \"A set automatically handles duplicates, so only distinct sums are stored, which avoids redundant calculations and ensures that the final result contains only unique values.\",\n    \"The time complexity is O(n * sum) because, in the worst case, for each number in the input (n), we might have to add it to all the sums already calculated (up to sum).
