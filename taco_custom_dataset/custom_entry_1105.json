For example, if Takayuki goes west, Kazuyuki goes east, and if Kazuyuki goes north, Takayuki goes south. Currently the two are in a department store and are in different locations. How can two people who move in the opposite direction meet as soon as possible?\\n\\nA department store is represented by a grid consisting of W horizontal x H vertical squares, and two people can move one square from north, south, east, and west per unit time. However, you cannot move outside the grid or to a square with obstacles.\\n\\nAs shown, the position of the grid cells is represented by the coordinates (x, y).\\n\\n<image>\\n\\n\\nCreate a program that inputs the grid information and the initial positions of the two people and outputs the shortest time until the two people meet. If you can't meet, or if it takes more than 100 hours to meet, print NA. The grid information is given by the numbers in rows H and columns W, and the location information of the two people is given by the coordinates.\\n\\nIf either Takayuki-kun or Kazuyuki-kun is out of the range of the obstacle or grid after moving, you cannot move, so the one who is out of the range of the obstacle or grid is the original place. But if you don't, you can move without returning to the original place.\\n\\nWhen two people meet, it means that they stay in the same square after moving. Even if two people pass each other, they do not meet.\\n\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\nA sequence of multiple datasets is given as input. The end of the input is indicated by two lines of zeros. Each dataset is given in the following format:\\n\\n\\nW H\\ntx ty\\nkx ky\\nd11 d21 ... dW1\\nd12 d22 ... dW2\\n::\\nd1H d2H ... dWH\\n\\n\\nThe first line gives the department store sizes W, H (1 \u2264 W, H \u2264 50). The second line gives Takayuki's initial position tx, ty, and the third line gives Kazuyuki's initial position kx, ky.\\n\\nThe H line that follows gives the department store information. di, j represents the type of square (i, j), 0 for movable squares and 1 for obstacles.\\n\\nThe number of datasets does not exceed 100.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nOutputs the shortest time on one line for each input dataset.\\n\\nExample\\n\\nInput\\n\\n6 6\\n2 4\\n6 2\\n0 0 0 0 1 0\\n0 1 0 0 0 0\\n0 1 0 0 0 0\\n0 0 0 1 0 0\\n0 0 0 0 0 1\\n0 0 0 0 0 0\\n3 3\\n1 1\\n3 3\\n0 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n0 0 0\\n0 0\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n3\\nNA\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"from collections import deque\\n\\ndef search(tx, ty, kx, ky, mp):\\n\\tdirect = ((-1, 0, 1, 0), (1, 0, -1, 0), (0, -1, 0, 1), (0, 1, 0, -1))\\n\\tdic = {}\\n\\tdic[tx, ty, kx, ky] = 0\\n\\tque = deque()\\n\\tque.append((0, (tx, ty, kx, ky)))\\n\\twhile que:\\n\\t\\t(dist, p) = que.popleft()\\n\\t\\t(tx, ty, kx, ky) = p\\n\\t\\tfor (dtx, dty, dkx, dky) in direct:\\n\\t\\t\\tif mp[ty + dty][tx + dtx] == 0:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(ntx, nty) = (tx + dtx, ty + dty)\\n\\t\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(ntx, nty) = (tx, ty)\\n\\t\\t\\tif mp[ky + dky][kx + dkx] == 0:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(nkx, nky) = (kx + dkx, ky + dky)\\n\\t\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(nkx, nky) = (kx, ky)\\n\\t\\t\\tif (ntx, nty, nkx, nky) not in dic:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif (ntx, nty) == (nkx, nky):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tif dist + 1 >= 100:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tprint('NA')\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tprint(dist + 1)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\treturn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdic[ntx, nty, nkx, nky] = True\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tque.append((dist + 1, (ntx, nty, nkx, nky)))\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tprint('NA')\\n\\ndef main():\\n\\twhile True:\\n\\t\\t(w, h) = map(int, input().split())\\n\\t\\tif w == 0:\\n\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\t\\t(tx, ty) = map(int, input().split())\\n\\t\\t(kx, ky) = map(int, input().split())\\n\\t\\tmp = [[1] + list(map(int, input().split())) + [1] for _ in range(h)]\\n\\t\\tmp.insert(0, [1] * (w + 2))\\n\\t\\tmp.append([1] * (w + 2))\\n\\t\\tsearch(tx, ty, kx, ky, mp)\\nmain()\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires finding the shortest time for two individuals (Takayuki and Kazuyuki) to meet in a grid, where they move in opposite directions. The grid represents a department store with obstacles, and movement is restricted to the four cardinal directions. If they cannot meet within 100 time units or cannot meet at all, the program should output 'NA'.\\n- Data Representation and Input: The input consists of grid dimensions (W, H), initial positions of Takayuki (tx, ty) and Kazuyuki (kx, ky), and a grid representation where 0 indicates a movable square and 1 indicates an obstacle. The input is a sequence of datasets terminated by two lines of zeros.\\n- Movement Rules: Takayuki and Kazuyuki move in opposite directions. If Takayuki moves north, Kazuyuki moves south, and so on. If a move would take either individual outside the grid or into an obstacle, they remain in their current position.\\n- Meeting Condition: The individuals meet when they occupy the same square after a simultaneous move. Passing each other doesn't count as meeting.\\n- Algorithm Selection: Breadth-First Search (BFS) is appropriate because we need to find the shortest path (minimum time) to a meeting point. The state space can be represented as the coordinates of both individuals (tx, ty, kx, ky). A dictionary (or set) will keep track of visited states to avoid cycles and redundant exploration. \\n- Optimization and Constraints: The problem imposes a time limit of 100. If the shortest meeting time exceeds this, the output should be 'NA'. This constraint influences the termination condition of the BFS.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How should the grid be represented in memory, considering the need to check for boundaries and obstacles?\",\n    \"How can the opposite movement directions of Takayuki and Kazuyuki be efficiently encoded and applied?\",\n    \"How to efficiently determine when Takayuki and Kazuyuki have met, given that they move simultaneously?\",\n    \"How to handle the constraint that they must meet within 100 time units, and what output is expected if they don't?\",\n    \"How can BFS be used to explore the state space of possible positions for Takayuki and Kazuyuki, considering the constraints of their movements and the grid?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The grid can be represented as a 2D array (list of lists), where each element represents a square. To simplify boundary checks, the grid can be padded with 1s (obstacles) around the edges.\",\n    \"The opposite movement directions can be encoded using tuples. For example, (1, 0) represents moving one step to the right, and (-1, 0) represents moving one step to the left. Thus, if Takayuki moves (dx, dy), Kazuyuki moves (-dx, -dy).\",\n    \"Takayuki and Kazuyuki have met if, after their simultaneous move, their coordinates are the same (ntx == nkx and nty == nky).\",\n    \"The BFS search should be terminated when the time (distance) exceeds 100. If the search completes without them meeting within 100 time units, the output should be 'NA'.\",\n    \"BFS can be used to explore possible states (tx, ty, kx, ky). Each state represents the positions of Takayuki and Kazuyuki at a given time. The search expands from the initial state by considering all possible moves (opposite directions) for each individual. A queue will maintain the states to be explored, and a set/dictionary will keep track of visited states to prevent revisiting.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
