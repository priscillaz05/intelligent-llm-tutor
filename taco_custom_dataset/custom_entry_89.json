If there are two multiples equidistant from a^b, we need to print the smaller one.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Consider cases where a^b might be 0 or negative (although constraint specifies a^b > 0). Handle the case where a^b is already a multiple of 'c'. Also consider the edge cases described in the prompt with negative exponents.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Calculate a^b. Find the nearest multiples of 'c' that are less than and greater than a^b. Compare their absolute differences to a^b and choose the closest multiple. Handle the edge case where multiple answers exist by picking the smallest one.\\n- Optimizing for Speed: Directly compute a^b. calculate quotient and remainder of (a^b)/c. Based on remainder either add or subtract the remainder to the number and print result\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do I calculate a^b when b can be negative or positive?\",\n    \"How do I handle the constraint 0 < a^b <= 10^9, especially when b is negative?\",\n    \"What happens if there are two multiples of 'c' equally close to a^b?\",\n    \"How do I efficiently find the nearest multiples of 'c' to a^b?\",\n    \"Can a, b, or c be zero, and how would that affect the calculation?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"If b is positive, use the exponentiation operator (**). If b is negative, use the exponentiation operator with the negative exponent. Handle edge cases where this operation exceeds the constraints.\",\n    \"When b is negative, a^b can be represented as 1 / (a^(-b)). Check whether the constraints are met. If not then return appropriate message\",\n    \"If the two multiples are equally close, select the smaller multiple of 'c'.\",\n    \"Calculate integer division of a^b by c to find the closest multiple below. Use the remainder to calculate the next multiple above.\",\n    \"c cannot be zero as per the problem. a and b can be zero (with restrictions): if a is 0 and b is positive, a^b is 0. If a is 0 and b is negative, it will throw division by zero exception. If b is 0, then a^b is 1.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
