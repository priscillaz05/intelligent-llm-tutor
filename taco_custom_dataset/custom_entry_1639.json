Since the result can be large, it needs to be returned modulo 10^9 + 7.\\n- Identifying the Approach: Dynamic programming appears suitable since we're dealing with subsequences and divisibility. We can maintain a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` stores the count of subsequences ending at index `j` that have a remainder `i` when divided by `N`.\\n- Defining the DP Transitions: The DP transitions need to consider two cases for each character in the string: including it in the subsequence or excluding it. When including a character at index `i`, the remainder needs to be updated based on the previous remainder and the digit's value. Excluding the character simply carries forward the count from the previous index.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Initializing the base cases of the DP array, especially for the first character, is crucial. Also, properly handling the modulo operation throughout the computation is important to avoid overflow.\\n- Space Optimization Considerations: While space optimization isn't strictly required by the problem, it might be worth considering whether the DP array can be reduced to two rows (current and previous) to save memory.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you represent the states in your dynamic programming approach, and what does each state signify?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: A 2D array `dp[i][j]` where `i` represents the remainder when divided by `N`, and `j` represents the index in the string `s`.

If excluded, the remainder remains the same as the previous index.\",\n    \"How do you deal with large results that might exceed the maximum integer value?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: Perform the modulo operation (10^9 + 7) at each step of the calculation to prevent integer overflow and ensure the final result remains within the required range.\",\n    \"How should you initialize the DP table, and what are the base cases?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: The base cases are for the first digit.
