This means sorting the operations by C_j in descending order.\\n- Optimizing Card Selection: Within each operation, only replace cards with values less than C_j. This ensures that each replacement increases the sum.\\n- Considering the Constraints: The constraints include the limit on the number of cards that can be replaced in each operation (B_j) and the overall number of cards (N). Ensure the replacement doesn't exceed the number of cards.\\n- Algorithm Selection and Data Structures: Sort the initial cards to easily identify the smallest values for replacement. Use a list of tuples (B_j, C_j) for operations and sort this list based on C_j values in descending order.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Handle cases where B_j is larger than the remaining replaceable cards after previous operations.\\n- Python Implementation details: Read in input, sort the initial cards.
