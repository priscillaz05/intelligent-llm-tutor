The ABC number of a string is defined as the number of triples (i, j, k) such that S[i] = 'A', S[j] = 'B', and S[k] = 'C', with 1 <= i < j < k <= |S|.\\n- Handling the '?' Characters: Each '?' contributes a factor of 3 to the total number of strings. The replacements need to be systematically considered to compute the sum of ABC numbers across all possible strings. Since the final answer needs to be modulo 10^9 + 7, we need to perform modulo operations during calculations to prevent overflow.\\n- Accumulating Counts: The ground truth solution uses prefix sums (acc_a, acc_c, acc_q) to efficiently calculate the number of 'A's, 'C's, and '?'s up to a given index. This helps in computing the ABC number for each generated string in an optimized manner.\\n- Optimizing Calculation: When considering a 'B' or '?' at index i, the solution calculates the contribution of this position to the total ABC number. It iterates through possible combinations of replacing the '?' with 'A', 'B', or 'C', and uses precomputed counts and powers of 3 to derive the contribution for this index.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you represent and calculate the number of possible strings given the number of '?' characters in the input string?\",\n    \"How can prefix sums be utilized to optimize the computation of ABC numbers for each possible string configuration?\",\n    \"When iterating through the string, how do you efficiently determine the contribution of each 'B' or '?' to the total sum of ABC numbers, considering all possible '?' replacements?\",\n    \"How do you handle the modulo operation to prevent integer overflow, and where should it be applied within the calculations?\",\n    \"What edge cases or initial conditions should be taken into account when implementing the solution, particularly regarding the powers of 3 and prefix sums?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The number of possible strings can be calculated as 3 raised to the power of the number of '?' characters. This is because each '?' can be replaced by one of three characters: 'A', 'B', or 'C'.\",\n    \"Prefix sums can be used to efficiently calculate the number of 'A's before a 'B' and the number of 'C's after a 'B', which is crucial for determining the number of ABC triples for each possible string. This avoids redundant counting in each iteration.\",\n    \"When encountering a 'B' or '?', the contribution can be calculated by considering all possible combinations of replacing the '?' characters. The counts of 'A's before the 'B' and 'C's after the 'B', along with the powers of 3 representing the possible combinations of '?' replacements, contribute to the total sum.\",\n    \"The modulo operation (modulo 10^9 + 7) should be applied after each multiplication and addition to prevent integer overflow. This ensures that the final result remains within the required range.\",\n    \"The initial condition for the powers of 3 array should start with 1 (3^0). Edge cases include handling strings with no '?' characters or strings where no ABC triples are possible. Also, properly initializing and updating prefix sums is important.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
