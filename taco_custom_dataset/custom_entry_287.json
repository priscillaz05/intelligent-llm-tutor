Squaring both sides gives Y^2 = x + Y, or Y^2 - Y - x = 0. Solving this quadratic equation for Y gives Y = (1 + sqrt(1 + 4x)) / 2 (only the positive root is relevant).\\n- Calculating the Expected Value of Y: The expected value E[Y] is the average of Y over all possible values of x. Since x = rand() % N, x can take on integer values from 0 to N-1. Therefore, E[Y] = (1/N) * sum((1 + sqrt(1 + 4x)) / 2) for x from 0 to N-1.\\n- Optimizing for Larger N: For larger values of N (up to 10^16), directly computing the sum for each test case might be inefficient.
