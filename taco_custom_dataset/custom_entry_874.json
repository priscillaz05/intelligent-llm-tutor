"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"There is a country with $n$ citizens. The $i$-th of them initially has $a_{i}$ money. The government strictly controls the wealth of its citizens. Whenever a citizen makes a purchase or earns some money, they must send a receipt to the social services mentioning the amount of money they currently have.\\n\\nSometimes the government makes payouts to the poor: all citizens who have strictly less money than $x$ are paid accordingly so that after the payout they have exactly $x$ money. In this case the citizens don't send a receipt.\\n\\nYou know the initial wealth of every citizen and the log of all events: receipts and payouts. Restore the amount of money each citizen has after all events.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\\\le n \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^{5}$)\u00a0\u2014 the numer of citizens.\\n\\nThe next line contains $n$ integers $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ ($0 \\\\le a_{i} \\\\le 10^{9}$)\u00a0\u2014 the initial balances of citizens.\\n\\nThe next line contains a single integer $q$ ($1 \\\\le q \\\\le 2 \\\\cdot 10^{5}$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of events.\\n\\nEach of the next $q$ lines contains a single event. The events are given in chronological order.\\n\\nEach event is described as either 1 p x ($1 \\\\le p \\\\le n$, $0 \\\\le x \\\\le 10^{9}$), or 2 x ($0 \\\\le x \\\\le 10^{9}$). In the first case we have a receipt that the balance of the $p$-th person becomes equal to $x$. In the second case we have a payoff with parameter $x$.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nPrint $n$ integers\u00a0\u2014 the balances of all citizens after all events.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n4\\n1 2 3 4\\n3\\n2 3\\n1 2 2\\n2 1\\n\\nOutput\\n3 2 3 4 \\n\\nInput\\n5\\n3 50 2 1 10\\n3\\n1 2 0\\n2 8\\n1 3 20\\n\\nOutput\\n8 8 20 8 10 \\n\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first example the balances change as follows: 1 2 3 4 $\\\\rightarrow$ 3 3 3 4 $\\\\rightarrow$ 3 2 3 4 $\\\\rightarrow$ 3 2 3 4\\n\\nIn the second example the balances change as follows: 3 50 2 1 10 $\\\\rightarrow$ 3 0 2 1 10 $\\\\rightarrow$ 8 8 8 8 10 $\\\\rightarrow$ 8 8 20 8 10\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"n = int(input())\\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\\nlast_updated = [0 for _ in range(n)]\\nq = int(input())\\npay_days = [0 for _ in range(q)]\\nfor i in range(q):\\n\\tqu = list(map(int, input().split()))\\n\\tif qu[0] == 1:\\n\\t\\t(_, p, x) = qu\\n\\t\\ta[p - 1] = x\\n\\t\\tlast_updated[p - 1] = i\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\t(_, x) = qu\\n\\t\\tpay_days[i] = x\\nfor i in range(q - 1):\\n\\tpay_days[q - i - 2] = max(pay_days[q - i - 1], pay_days[q - i - 2])\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\tprint(max(a[i], pay_days[last_updated[i]]), end=' ')\\nprint()\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding Problem Requirements: The problem involves tracking the wealth of $n$ citizens, which changes due to individual transactions (receipts) and government payouts. The task requires simulating these events and outputting the final wealth of each citizen.\\n- Identifying Data Structures: Decide appropriate data structures to efficiently store the initial wealth, the history of payouts, and the last time each citizen's wealth was updated by a receipt.\\n- Defining Algorithmic Strategy: Process events chronologically. Maintain an array representing the last payout until each event. For each citizen, determine whether their last update was before the latest applicable payout. If so, their final wealth should reflect the payout. Otherwise, their wealth should reflect their individual transaction.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Handle the case where a citizen's wealth might be affected by multiple payouts. Take into account that the payouts are not applied immediately but are considered at the very end of the simulation to determine each citizen's final wealth.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How should I store the initial wealth and subsequent wealth updates for each citizen?\",\n    \"How do I keep track of payouts and their impact over time?\",\n    \"How can I effectively determine the final wealth of each citizen, considering individual transactions and payouts?\",\n    \"What is the best way to handle multiple payouts affecting the same citizen?\",\n    \"How should the chronological order of receipts and payouts be accounted for to reconstruct the correct state?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Use an array of size $n$ to store the wealth of each citizen. When a receipt event occurs, update the appropriate element in the array.\",\n    \"Store the payout amounts in an array indexed by the event number. Propagate maximum payouts backward to determine the highest payout up to each event.\",\n    \"For each citizen, compare the last update time from receipts with the time of the latest relevant payout. Apply the maximum of the two values.\",\n    \"By propagating maximum payouts backward, ensure that each citizen is only affected by the maximum payout that occurred after their last receipt.\",\n    \"Process events in chronological order to accurately update wealth based on individual transactions. Then, use the propagated payout array to determine the final wealth based on the highest payout relevant to each citizen.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
