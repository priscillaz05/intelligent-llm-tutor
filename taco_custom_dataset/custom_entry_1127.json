If possible, we must output 'YES' along with a valid X; otherwise, we output 'NO'.\\n- Identifying Constraints and Edge Cases: We need to consider the constraints on X (1 <= X <= 2 * 10^7) and the range of elements in A (1 <= A[i] <= 10^7). An important edge case is when the input array is already a permutation of 1 to N, in which case X = N + 1 will always work.\\n- Developing an Algorithm: The general approach involves testing different values of X to see if A % X results in a permutation of 1 to N. A brute-force approach to testing all X values within the specified range is infeasible.  A more efficient approach is to derive potential candidates for X based on the differences between the elements of A and the required permutation.  We can consider the case where A[i] % X should ideally result in a number between 1 and N.  The sum of all the elements minus the intended sum might provide some insight.\\n- Optimization and Simplification: The efficiency of the algorithm is crucial, given the constraints. Precalculating a set of candidate X values and then iterating through them is a possible optimization. If we find the array A already contains all numbers from 1 to N, then choosing X=N+1 will result in A remaining the same, hence becoming a permutation. We must quickly check to determine if A is already a permutation.  If it is already a permutation then X = N+1.  This would result in A[i] % (N+1) = A[i] since A[i] <= N and thus A would remain a permutation.\\n- Implementation Details: The Python code would require efficient methods for checking if a list contains a permutation, generating potential X candidates, and verifying if a specific X transforms A into a permutation.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the definition of a permutation in the context of this problem?\",\n    \"How can we efficiently determine if an array can be transformed into a permutation by using the modulo operator?\",\n    \"What are some edge cases that need special handling, and how can those be addressed?\",\n    \"Given the constraints on the input size, how can we optimize the algorithm to avoid exceeding the time limit?\",\n    \"If the array A is already a permutation, what value of X should we choose to keep it a permutation?\",\n    \"If after applying the modulo operation A % X, if any element of A becomes 0 or > N, then is it possible for A to become a permutation?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A permutation of N integers is an array that contains each integer from 1 to N exactly once.\",\n    \"We can iterate through potential values of X within the specified range and, for each X, apply the modulo operation to the array. After that, we check if the resulting array is a permutation of integers from 1 to N.
