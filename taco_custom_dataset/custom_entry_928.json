Cell (3,    3) is under attack of 4 knights in cells (1,    2), (2,    1), (4,    1) and (5,    2), therefore Ivan will place a knight in this cell. Cell (4,    5) is initially attacked by only 3 knights in cells (2,    6), (5,    7) and (6,    6). But new knight in cell (3,    3) also attacks cell (4,    5), now it is attacked by 4 knights and Ivan will place another knight in this cell. There are no more free cells which are attacked by 4 or more knights, so the process stops. There are 9 knights in the end, which is not less than \u230a \\\\frac{7^{2}}{10} \u230b = 4.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"n = int(input())\\nanss = [(0, 0)]\\nfor i in range(1, n):\\n\\tanss.append((0, i))\\n\\tanss.append((i, 0))\\n\\tanss.append((0, -i))\\n\\tanss.append((-i, 0))\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\tprint(str(anss[i][0]) + ' ' + str(anss[i][1]))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem describes a process where knights are placed on a chessboard, and new knights are added to cells attacked by at least four knights until no such cells exist. The goal is to find an initial arrangement of 'n' knights that results in at least floor(n^2/10) knights in the final configuration.\\n- Identifying a Strategy: The crucial part is identifying a suitable initial configuration. The provided solution uses a pattern where knights are placed along the axes. This kind of star-like arrangement often leads to sufficient overlapping attack zones, thus initiating the cascade of knight placements needed to satisfy the condition.\\n- Algorithm Selection: The solution iteratively adds knights along the x and y axes, specifically at (0, i), (i, 0), (0, -i), and (-i, 0) for i from 1 to n-1, effectively creating a symmetrical arrangement around the origin (0, 0), which is also initially occupied. This method efficiently maximizes overlapping attack zones.\\n- Edge Case Handling: Consider cases where 'n' is small. The floor(n^2/10) condition implies that even for small values of 'n', a certain minimum number of knights are required in the end.\\n- Output Format: Make sure each knight's coordinates (x, y) are printed on a new line and that each coordinate is printed as a string separated by a space.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Can you explain the stopping condition for placing new knights, and how it relates to the final number of knights?\",\n    \"How does the proposed solution's pattern of placing knights along the axes contribute to maximizing the final number of knights?\",\n    \"Why is a symmetrical arrangement around the origin a good strategy for this particular problem?\",\n    \"What adjustments might be needed if the problem required different minimum counts or a different attack criteria?\",\n    \"How does the code ensure that the output meets the required format, and what potential errors could occur during output?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The stopping condition is when there are no more empty cells attacked by at least four knights. The final number of knights is the total number of knights after this process stops, which should be at least floor(n^2/10).\",\n    \"Placing knights along the axes, especially in a star-like pattern, creates numerous overlapping attack zones near the origin. This overlapping facilitates the placement of new knights according to the attack criteria, leading to a faster increase in the knight population.\",\n    \"A symmetrical arrangement helps distribute the attacks more evenly around the center, thus creating a higher concentration of attacked cells and increasing the likelihood of triggering the placement of new knights, especially near the origin.\",\n    \"If a different minimum count were required, the arrangement of initial knights might need to be adjusted to create more or fewer overlapping attack zones. Similarly, a different attack criteria (e.g., requiring 5 knights instead of 4) would necessitate a denser initial arrangement to trigger the placement of new knights.\",\n    \"The code converts the x and y coordinates to strings before printing them, separated by a space, and ensures each pair is printed on a new line. Potential errors could include incorrect formatting of the output, such as missing spaces or newlines, or exceeding the allowed coordinate range (-10^9 to 10^9).\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
