A subsequence doesn't need to be contiguous but must maintain the order of characters.\\n- Edge Cases and Constraints: Consider when no such subsequence exists (return -1). The lengths of S and T are limited to 500. This influences the complexity constraints. \\n- Algorithmic Strategy: Dynamic Programming (DP) seems suitable because we are comparing subsequences. The DP table will store the length of shortest uncommon subsequence.\\n- DP Table Definition: dp[i][j] stores the length of the shortest uncommon subsequence of S[0...i-1] that is not a subsequence of T[0...j-1].\\n- Base Cases: dp[0][j] = Infinity (or a large number like 501), as an empty string S cannot have any subsequence not in T. dp[i][0] = 1, since any single character from S will not be a subsequence of an empty string T.\\n- Recurrence Relation: Iterate through both strings. If S[i-1] is not in T[0...j-1], then dp[i][j] = 1. Otherwise, dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], 1 + dp[i-1][k]) where 'k' is the index of the last occurrence of S[i-1] in T[0...j-1]. Finding 'k' is critical and needs efficient lookup.\\n- Optimization: Precompute or memoize the last occurrences of each character of S in T to avoid repeated linear searches.\\n- Final Result: Return dp[m][n] if less than 501, else return -1.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does 'shortest uncommon subsequence' mean in the context of the problem, and how does it differ from 'shortest uncommon substring'?\",\n    \"What are the crucial base cases for the dynamic programming approach, and why are they important?\",\n    \"How do you efficiently track the last occurrence of a character in string T while building the DP table, and what data structure would you use?\",\n    \"In the recurrence relation, why do we take the minimum of dp[i-1][j] and 1 + dp[i-1][k], and what do these two terms represent?\",\n    \"What special condition do you need to check for before returning dp[m][n] as the result, and why is it necessary?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A shortest uncommon subsequence of S that is not in T is the shortest sequence of characters appearing in S in the same order (but not necessarily contiguous) that is not present as a subsequence in T. It differs from 'shortest uncommon substring' in that a substring must be contiguous.\",\n    \"The crucial base cases are dp[0][j] = Infinity (or a large value) because an empty string can't have any subsequence not in T and dp[i][0] = 1 because any single character from S is not a subsequence of an empty string T. These initializations set up the foundation for the DP calculations.\",\n    \"To efficiently track the last occurrence of a character in T, I could use a dictionary (hash map) to store the indices. Before building the DP table, iterate through T and update the dictionary with the most recent index for each character.

The minimum is taken because we want the *shortest* such subsequence.\",\n    \"Before returning dp[m][n], check if it is greater than or equal to a large number (like 501). If so, it means no uncommon subsequence was found, and you should return -1.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
