There is an energy infrastructure project planning meeting, and the government needs to know the fewest number of power plants needed to provide electricity to the entire list of cities.  Determine that number.  If it cannot be done, return -1.\\n\\nYou are given a list of city data.  Cities that may contain a power plant have been labeled $unrecognized$.  Others not suitable for building a plant are labeled $unrecognized$.  Given a distribution range of $unrecognized$, find the lowest number of plants that must be built such that all cities are served.  The distribution range limits supply to cities where distance is less than k.\\n\\nExample \\n\\n$unrecognized$ \\n\\n$unrecognized$   \\n\\nEach city is $unrecognized$ unit distance from its neighbors, and we'll use $unrecognized$ based indexing.  We see there are $unrecognized$ cities suitable for power plants, cities $unrecognized$ and $unrecognized$.  If we build a power plant at $unrecognized$, it can serve $unrecognized$ through $unrecognized$ because those endpoints are at a distance of $unrecognized$ and $unrecognized$.  To serve $unrecognized$, we would need to be able to build a plant in city $unrecognized$ or $unrecognized$.  Since none of those is suitable, we must return -1.  It cannot be done using the current distribution constraint.\\n\\nFunction Description  \\n\\nComplete the pylons function in the editor below.    \\n\\npylons has the following parameter(s):  \\n\\nint k: the distribution range  \\nint arr[n]: each city's suitability as a building site  \\n\\nReturns  \\n\\nint: the minimum number of plants required or -1  \\n\\nInput Format\\n\\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers $unrecognized$ and $unrecognized$, the number of cities in Goodland and the plants' range constant. \\n\\nThe second line contains $unrecognized$ space-separated binary integers where each integer indicates suitability for building a plant.  \\n\\nConstraints\\n\\n$unrecognized$\\nEach $unrecognized$.\\n\\nSubtask\\n\\n$unrecognized$ for $unrecognized$ of the maximum score.\\n\\nOutput Format\\n\\nPrint a single integer denoting the minimum number of plants that must be built so that all of Goodland's cities have electricity.

If it's not possible to cover all cities, return -1.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints: The range `k` determines how far a power plant can supply electricity. The array `arr` indicates whether a city can host a power plant. The goal is to find the minimum number of plants to cover all cities.\\n- Choosing an Algorithm: A greedy approach is suitable here. Iterate through the cities, and for each city, find the farthest suitable power plant to the left within the range `k`. If no such plant exists, it's impossible to cover all cities. Otherwise, place a plant at the farthest suitable city and update the covered range.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: If no suitable power plant can reach a city, return -1. If all cities are covered, return the number of plants used.\\n- Optimization Considerations: The critical step is to find the farthest suitable power plant to the left within the range `k`. We can search backwards from `last + k -1` to last-k+1 for max(j for j in range(max(0, last - k + 1), min(n, last + k)) if c[j]), where last is the current covered index.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the coverage area of a power plant in Goodland, and how does the range 'k' define this area?\",\n    \"How does the 'arr' array constrain the placement of power plants, and what does a value of 0 or 1 represent in this array?\",\n    \"What is the best strategy (greedy, dynamic programming, etc.) for determining the minimum number of power plants, and why is it suitable for this problem?\",\n    \"How can you handle cases where it is impossible to cover all cities, and what condition indicates that this is the case?\",\n    \"How do you update the covered range as you place power plants, and how does this affect your overall approach to solving the problem?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The coverage area of a power plant is defined by the range 'k', which means the plant can supply electricity to cities within a distance of k on either side.\",\n    \"The 'arr' array indicates which cities are suitable for hosting power plants. A value of 1 means a city can host a plant, while 0 means it cannot.\",\n    \"A greedy approach is suitable because you can iteratively place power plants at the farthest reachable suitable city, maximizing coverage with each plant.\",\n    \"It's impossible to cover all cities if, at any point, you cannot find a suitable power plant within range 'k' of an uncovered city. This means the leftmost uncovered city cannot be powered.\",\n    \"As you place power plants, you update the 'last' covered city. You should find the max range a powerplant can cover, and only place power plants if there are no gaps to cover to the leftmost city.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
