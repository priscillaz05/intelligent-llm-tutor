You've filled a pit with two different ferocious mythical creatures for Hercules to battle!\\n\\nThe formidable **\\\"Orthus\\\"** is a 2 headed dog with 1 tail.  The mighty **\\\"Hydra\\\"** has 5 heads and 1 tail. \\n\\nBefore Hercules goes in, he asks you \\\"How many of each beast am  I up against!?\\\".\\n\\nYou know the total number of heads and the total number of tails, that's the dangerous parts, right? But you didn't consider how many of each beast. \\n\\n## Task\\n\\nGiven the number of heads and the number of tails, work out the number of each mythical beast! \\n\\nThe data is given as two parameters. Your answer should be returned as an array:\\n```python \\n VALID ->      [24 , 15]           INVALID ->  \\\"No solutions\\\"\\n```\\n\\nIf there aren't any cases for the given amount of heads and tails - return \\\"No solutions\\\" or null (C#).\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def beasts(heads, tails):\\n\\torthus = (5 * tails - heads) / 3\\n\\thydra = tails - orthus\\n\\treturn [orthus, hydra] if orthus >= 0 and hydra >= 0 else 'No solutions'\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The task is to determine the number of Orthus and Hydra creatures given the total number of heads and tails. Each Orthus has 2 heads and 1 tail, and each Hydra has 5 heads and 1 tail.\\n- Setting up the Equations: Formulate a system of two linear equations. Let 'x' be the number of Orthus and 'y' be the number of Hydra. The equations are:\\n  2x + 5y = heads\\n  x + y = tails\\n- Solving the System of Equations: Solve the system of equations to find 'x' and 'y'.  From the second equation, x = tails - y. Substitute into the first equation: 2(tails - y) + 5y = heads. Simplify to get 3y = heads - 2 * tails, so y = (heads - 2 * tails) / 3.  Then, x = tails - y.\\n- Handling Constraints and Invalid Solutions: Check if the calculated values for 'x' and 'y' are non-negative integers. If either 'x' or 'y' is negative or not an integer, there are no valid solutions. Return \\\"No solutions\\\" in such cases.\\n- Returning the Result: If valid solutions exist, return an array [x, y] where x is the number of Orthus and y is the number of Hydra.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can we formulate the problem as a system of linear equations?\",\n    \"What conditions must be satisfied for a solution to be valid?\",\n    \"How should the result be returned if a valid solution exists?\",\n    \"What steps should be taken when the calculated numbers of Orthus and Hydra are not non-negative integers?\",\n    \"Is it possible to solve this problem by creating a program that iterates through every combination of beasts?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Let x be the number of Orthus and y be the number of Hydra. Then, we can create the equations: 2x + 5y = heads, and x + y = tails.\",\n    \"For a solution to be valid, both the number of Orthus (x) and the number of Hydra (y) must be non-negative integers.\",\n    \"If a valid solution exists, the result should be returned as an array [x, y], where x is the number of Orthus and y is the number of Hydra.\",\n    \"If the calculated number of Orthus or Hydra are negative or not integers, it means there are no solutions; the function should return \\\"No solutions\\\".\",\n    \"Yes, an iterative solution would work, by going through every combination of Orthus and hydra, which could be done with a for-loop, but is likely to be slower.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
