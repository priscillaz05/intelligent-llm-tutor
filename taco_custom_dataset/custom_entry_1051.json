Each pair of digits in the input string represents the ASCII code of a character. The function must extract these two-digit numbers and convert each to its corresponding ASCII character.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Consider edge cases such as an empty input string, an input string with an odd number of digits, or a string containing non-numeric characters. Handle invalid ASCII codes. \\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Iterate through the input string, taking two digits at a time. Convert these two digits into an integer, and then use the `chr()` function to convert the integer to its ASCII character. Concatenate these characters to form the output string.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Use a loop with a step of 2 to iterate through the input string. Ensure that the input string is valid before processing. Handle potential exceptions such as `ValueError` if the input string contains non-numeric characters.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does the `chr()` function do, and why is it relevant to this problem?\",\n    \"How would you handle the case where the input string has an odd number of digits?\",\n    \"What steps are involved in converting a two-digit string into its corresponding ASCII character?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently iterate through the input string and extract two digits at a time?\",\n    \"What should the function do if the converted integer is not a valid ASCII code (e.g., less than 65 or greater than 90 for uppercase letters)?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The `chr()` function converts an integer representing a Unicode code point to its corresponding character. It is relevant here because we need to convert the two-digit integers extracted from the string into ASCII characters.\",\n    \"If the input string has an odd number of digits, the last digit should be ignored since ASCII characters are generally represented by two digits.\",\n    \"First, the two-digit substring is extracted from the input string.
