You perform $n$ actions with this array: during the $i$-th action, the following sequence of operations appears:  Choose the maximum by length subarray (continuous subsegment) consisting only of zeros, among all such segments choose the leftmost one;  Let this segment be $[l; r]$. If $r-l+1$ is odd (not divisible by $2$) then assign (set) $a[\\frac{l+r}{2}] := i$ (where $i$ is the number of the current action), otherwise (if $r-l+1$ is even) assign (set) $a[\\frac{l+r-1}{2}] := i$. \\n\\nConsider the array $a$ of length $5$ (initially $a=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$). Then it changes as follows:  Firstly, we choose the segment $[1; 5]$ and assign $a[3] := 1$, so $a$ becomes $[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]$;  then we choose the segment $[1; 2]$ and assign $a[1] := 2$, so $a$ becomes $[2, 0, 1, 0, 0]$;  then we choose the segment $[4; 5]$ and assign $a[4] := 3$, so $a$ becomes $[2, 0, 1, 3, 0]$;  then we choose the segment $[2; 2]$ and assign $a[2] := 4$, so $a$ becomes $[2, 4, 1, 3, 0]$;  and at last we choose the segment $[5; 5]$ and assign $a[5] := 5$, so $a$ becomes $[2, 4, 1, 3, 5]$. \\n\\nYour task is to find the array $a$ of length $n$ after performing all $n$ actions.

In each step, we find the largest zero-filled subarray and assign the current iteration number to the middle element (or the element just before the middle if the subarray's length is even).\\n- Identifying Edge Cases and Constraints: The length of the array $n$ can be up to $2 * 10^5$. We need to handle cases where the length of the subarray is odd and even differently. We also must find the leftmost maximal sub-array.\\n- Choosing an Algorithm: A recursive approach can be used to break down the problem into smaller subproblems.  Each recursive call identifies the midpoint of the largest subarray and divides the remaining subarrays into two halves. Sorting the result of the recursive calls by length (descending) and then by the starting position(ascending) of the interval ensures the leftmost maximal sub-array choice. The problem guarantees that the answer is unique.\\n- Implementation Details: Recursively find the subarrays and populate them with the proper iteration value. Sort the intervals found by length (descending) and starting location (ascending). Iterate through sorted intervals to construct final array.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you find the maximum length subarray of zeros, and how do you choose the leftmost one if there are multiple?\",\n    \"How should the index be computed differently when the length of the subarray is even versus odd?\",\n    \"How would you structure the code to handle each test case efficiently without exceeding time limit?\",\n    \"What would be a recursive approach to solve this problem?\",\n    \"How can you ensure that the leftmost maximal segment is chosen?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Iterate through the array, keeping track of the current zero subarray length. If encountering a non-zero element, reset the current length. Keep track of the maximum length seen so far and its starting index.
