Rows are numbered 1 to N, from top to bottom. Columns are numbered 1 to M, from left to right. You are initially at cell (1, 1) and want to go to cell (N, M). From any cell you can move to the cell below it or to the cell right to it. You should never go out of the grid. At any point you should consider all the possibilities of movement with equal probability\\nLet P[i][j] be the probability of visiting cell (i, j). You need to calculate the sum of P[i][j] for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 M.\\nAs we all know, Tojo really hates probability related problems. He wants you to solve this task\\n\\n-----Input-----\\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.Only line of each test case has two integer N and M.\\n\\n-----Output-----\\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the required answer. Answers within an absolute or relative error of 10-6 will be accepted.\\n\\n-----Constraints-----\\n- 1 \u2264 T \u2264 1000\\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 1000\\n- 1 \u2264 M \u2264 1000\\n\\n-----Example-----\\nInput:\\n2\\n2 2\\n1 6\\n\\nOutput:\\n3.000000\\n6.000000\\n\\n-----Explanation-----\\nExample case 1\\nProbability matrix P for N=2, M=2 is\\n\\n1.0 0.5\\n\\n0.5 1.0\\n\\nYou are at (1, 1) initially. So the probablity of visiting (1, 1) is 1. At (1, 1) you have 2 options, move below to (2, 1) or to right cell (1, 2). Probablity of going to (1, 2) is 0.5. Probability of going to (2, 1) is 0.5. You always end up at (2, 2), so P[2][2] is 1. Required sum = 1.0 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1.0 = 3.0\\nExample case 2\\nProbability matrix P for N=1, M=6 is\\n\\n1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0\\n\\nBecause at any position there is only one possible next position.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"for _ in range(int(input())):\\n\\t(N, M) = map(int, input().split())\\n\\tprint('{:.6f}'.format(N + M - 1))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem asks to calculate the sum of probabilities of visiting each cell (i, j) in an N x M grid, starting from (1, 1) and moving only down or right. The probabilities are determined by the equal likelihood of moving to each possible next cell.\\n- Identifying the Pattern: Notice that to reach cell (i, j), you must take i - 1 downward steps and j - 1 rightward steps. The total number of paths from (1, 1) to (N, M) is fixed, regardless of the specific path taken. The problem statement and examples suggest a linear relationship between N, M, and the result.\\n- Deriving the Formula: Based on the examples, the sum of probabilities appears to be N + M - 1. For N=2, M=2, the sum is 3.0. For N=1, M=6, the sum is 6.0. This formula holds true for these cases, and it should be verified for other cases if possible.\\n- Implementing the Solution: Implement the formula directly in the code by reading N and M from input and outputting N + M - 1 formatted to six decimal places.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the relationship between the number of rows (N), the number of columns (M), and the sum of probabilities P[i][j]?\",\n    \"How is the probability P[i][j] of visiting a cell (i, j) determined, given the movement constraints?\",\n    \"Can you derive a general formula to calculate the sum of probabilities based on N and M?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases for N and M, and how would they affect the result?\",\n    \"How would you format the output to meet the requirement of six decimal places?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The sum of probabilities P[i][j] appears to be equal to N + M - 1 based on the given examples. This seems to be a linear relationship.\",\n    \"The probability P[i][j] depends on the number of paths leading to (i, j) and the equal probability of choosing either the downward or rightward direction at each step. The probability starts at 1 at the origin (1,1) and gets distributed as we move to subsequent cells.\",\n    \"The general formula is likely to be sum of probabilities = N + M - 1. This holds true for the provided examples, where for N=2 and M=2, the sum is 3, and for N=1 and M=6, the sum is 6.\",\n    \"If either N or M is 1, the path is a straight line, and each cell has a probability of 1 until we reach the end of the grid. If both are 1, the sum is 1, and the formula N + M - 1 still applies (1 + 1 - 1 = 1).\",\n    \"You can use Python's string formatting to format the output to six decimal places: '{:.6f}'.format(N + M - 1).\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
