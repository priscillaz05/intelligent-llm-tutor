The pattern consists of lines where each line contains a sequence of K consecutive numbers.\\n- Analyzing the Pattern: The first line starts with 2, and each subsequent number in the line is incremented by 1. The starting number of each following line is the previous line's starting number incremented by 1.  The number of digits in each line is equal to the input K.\\n- Devising an Algorithm: Use nested loops. The outer loop iterates to create each line of the pattern. The inner loop generates the numbers for each line by starting with an initial value and incrementing it K times.\\n- Handling Input and Output: Read the number of test cases T, and then for each test case, read the input K. Output the generated pattern for each K value.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you determine the starting number for each line in the pattern?\",\n    \"How can you generate the consecutive sequence of numbers within each line of the pattern?\",\n    \"What is the relationship between the input K and the number of digits printed on each line?\",\n    \"Can you explain how to handle multiple test cases in the input?\",\n    \"What are the constraints on the input values T and K, and how might these constraints affect the algorithm's efficiency?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The starting number for the first line is 2. For each subsequent line, the starting number is incremented by 1 compared to the starting number of the previous line.\",\n    \"Within each line, you can start with the line's starting number and then repeatedly increment it by 1, printing each number until you have printed K numbers.\",\n    \"The input K determines the number of digits printed on each line. Each line contains K consecutive digits.\",\n    \"To handle multiple test cases, you first read the number of test cases T. Then, you iterate T times, reading a value for K in each iteration and generating the corresponding pattern.\",\n    \"The constraints $1 \\\\leq T \\\\leq 100$ and $1 \\\\leq K \\\\leq 100$ indicate that the number of test cases and the value of K are relatively small, so the algorithm's efficiency is not a major concern. A simple nested loop approach should be sufficient.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
