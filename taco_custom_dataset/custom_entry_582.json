The exclusive or evaluates two booleans.  It then returns true if **exactly one of the two expressions are true**, false otherwise.  For example:\\n\\n## Task\\n\\nSince we cannot define keywords in Javascript (well, at least I don't know how to do it), your task is to define a function ```xor(a, b)``` where a and b are the two expressions to be evaluated.  Your ```xor``` function should have the behaviour described above, returning true if **exactly one of the two expressions evaluate to true**, false otherwise.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def xor(a, b):\\n\\treturn a != b\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding Logical Operators: Clarify the definition of the exclusive OR (XOR) operator. Understand that XOR returns true only when its inputs differ; otherwise, it returns false.\\n- Boolean Evaluation: Recognize that XOR operates on boolean values and its result is also a boolean value.\\n- Simplification of Logic: Notice that 'exactly one is true' implies 'the two inputs are not the same.'\\n- Direct Implementation: Realize that directly comparing the inequality of the two boolean inputs is the most straightforward implementation of XOR.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the defining characteristic of the XOR operator compared to other boolean operators?\",\n    \"How can you express the XOR condition using fundamental comparison or boolean operators?\",\n    \"What are the possible combinations of boolean inputs (a, b) and what should the output of XOR be for each?\",\n    \"How does checking for inequality between two boolean inputs directly relate to the definition of XOR?\",\n    \"Are there alternative ways to express XOR using other boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT)?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"XOR returns true only when exactly one of its inputs is true, differing from AND (both must be true), OR (at least one must be true), and NOT.\",\n    \"You can express XOR as 'a != b' or '(a and not b) or (not a and b)'.\",\n    \"The combinations are (True, True), (True, False), (False, True), and (False, False). XOR outputs False, True, True, and False, respectively.\",\n    \"If two boolean inputs are not equal, it means one is true and the other is false, which satisfies the 'exactly one is true' condition of XOR.\",\n    \"Yes, XOR can be expressed as '(a and not b) or (not a and b)' or '(a or b) and not (a and b)'.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
