Thus, N friends need N left shoes and N right shoes, for a total of 2*N shoes.\\n- Determining the Algorithm: Calculate the total shoes needed (2*N). Determine the number of additional left shoes required (max(0, N - M)) and the number of additional right shoes needed (N). The total number of shoes to buy is then (N - M) + N if M < N and N if M >= N. However, it simplifies to 2N - M if M < N and N otherwise.  A simpler approach is to consider that Chef needs N left shoes and N right shoes. He has M left shoes. So, if M >= N, he just needs N right shoes. If M < N, he needs N - M left shoes and N right shoes. The total shoes he needs to buy is N + max(0, N - M) or max(2N - M, N).\\n- Edge Cases: Consider the case where Chef already has enough or more left shoes than needed (M >= N). In this scenario, he only needs to buy N right shoes. Also, consider the case where M = 0. In this scenario, he needs to buy N left shoes and N right shoes, a total of 2*N shoes.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the minimum number of shoes (left and right) required for each friend?\",\n    \"If Chef already has M left shoes, how does that affect the number of shoes he needs to buy?\",\n    \"What happens if Chef has more left shoes than the number of friends?
