If the string length is odd, return the single middle character; if even, return the two middle characters.\\n- Edge Cases: Handle the cases where the string length is small (e.g., 1 character).\\n- Algorithm Selection: Determine whether the string length is even or odd using the modulo operator. Use string slicing to extract the middle character(s) based on the length.\\n- Implementation Details: Ensure the index calculation is correct to grab the desired character(s).\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the primary difference in handling odd vs. even length strings, and how does it affect the output?\",\n    \"How can you determine whether the length of a string is even or odd?\",\n    \"Explain how you would calculate the index (or indices) of the middle character(s) based on whether the string length is even or odd.\",\n    \"Are there any edge cases you need to consider (e.g., an empty string), and how would you handle them?\",\n    \"Can you explain how string slicing works, and how you would use it to extract the desired characters?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"For odd length strings, you return one character; for even length strings, you return two characters.\",\n    \"You can use the modulo operator (%). If string_length % 2 == 0, the string is even; otherwise, it's odd.\",\n    \"For odd length: the index is length // 2. For even length: the indices are length // 2 - 1 and length // 2.\",\n    \"An empty string is an edge case. The problem statement specifies a string length > 0, but it's good to be mindful. An empty string should probably return an empty string.\",\n    \"String slicing extracts a substring. string[start:end] gets the characters from index 'start' up to (but not including) index 'end'.  For example, to get the middle two characters of an even string, you'd use string[length // 2 - 1:length // 2 + 1].\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
