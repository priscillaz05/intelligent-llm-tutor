The operations are 'R' (reverse a sublist), 'A' (add to a sublist), and 'M' (multiply a sublist). The list elements are also subjected to modulo operations.\\n- Handling Multiple Test Cases: The code must handle multiple test cases, each with its input parameters (N, L, A, B, C, S).\\n- Algorithmic Implementation: The core algorithm involves iterating through the operation string S and performing corresponding operations on the list L. The 'R' operation requires reversing the relevant sublist of L. The 'A' operation involves adding A to each element of a sublist and taking modulo C. The 'M' operation multiplies each element of a sublist by B and takes modulo C. Finally, the i-th element is printed after each operation.\\n- Optimization and Modulo Arithmetic: Since the constraints allow large numbers, using modulo operator after each arithmetic operation is crucial to prevent integer overflow. Consider the efficient implementation of the reverse operation and tracking of modifications using multiplicative and additive factors.\\n- Edge cases: Be aware of the cases when N equals to 1, what initial assumptions could be wrong. If S consists of empty String.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you efficiently reverse a sublist of the input list L in-place without creating a new list?\",\n    \"How would you keep track of the cumulative additions and multiplications to the sublist L[i...N] to avoid redundant computations and potential integer overflow, given the constraints?\",\n    \"What are the critical edge cases to consider, especially regarding the input values and the operations performed on the list elements?\",\n    \"Given the constraints on the input values (up to 10^18), how does the choice of data types and modular arithmetic influence the implementation?\",\n    \"How can you optimize the code to reduce the time complexity, especially with nested loops or repeated operations within the main loop?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"You can reverse the sublist using the two-pointer technique within the given range [i, N-1]. This involves swapping elements from the start and end of the sublist until the pointers meet in the middle.\",\n    \"Using multiplicative and additive factors can efficiently track the cumulative operations. Instead of directly modifying the list elements, maintain a multiplicative factor (initialized to 1) and an additive factor (initialized to 0). Update these factors based on 'A' and 'M' operations, and apply them to the list elements when necessary, always taking the modulo with C.\",\n    \"Edge cases include an empty operation string S, or when A and B are 0 or 1, respectively. Also, consider the case when C is 1, resulting in all elements becoming 0 after the modulo operation. Also, zero length input.\",\n    \"Use appropriate data types (e.g., long long in C++ or int in Python) to handle large numbers. Employ modular arithmetic after each operation to prevent integer overflow. Perform all additions, multiplications, and modulo operations carefully to avoid precision loss or overflow issues.\",\n    \"Optimize by reducing redundant calculations. Avoid creating new lists when reversing. Utilize the multiplicative and additive factors to minimize computations within the loop. Consider alternative implementations for the reverse operation if the list is very large to reduce the complexity of the algorithm if it's possible.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
