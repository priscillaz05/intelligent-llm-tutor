The constraints state that `n` and `m` can be very large (up to 10^16), which means a direct iteration through all numbers from 1 to `n` would be too slow.\\n- Identifying Optimizations: Notice that only the last digit of the multiples of `m` matters, and these last digits form a repeating pattern.  The pattern repeats every 10 multiples of `m`. Therefore, the key optimization is to find this pattern and use it to calculate the sum efficiently.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: Calculate the last digits of the first 10 multiples of `m`.  Store these last digits in a list. Calculate how many full cycles of 10 multiples of `m` occur within the range 1 to `n`.  Multiply the sum of the digits in one cycle by the number of full cycles. Then, add the sum of the remaining digits (less than 10) that don't form a full cycle.\\n- Implementation Details: Pay attention to handling large input values by using integer division and modulo operations carefully. Calculate `n // m` (number of multiples of m) and `(n // m) // 10` (number of full cycles), and `(n // m) % 10` (number of remaining elements).\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you approach this problem considering the large constraints on `n` and `m` (up to 10^16), which makes a direct iterative approach infeasible?\",\n    \"What pattern can be observed in the last digits of multiples of `m`, and how can this pattern be used to optimize the solution?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the number of complete cycles of the repeating pattern within the range 1 to `n`, and how do you use this information to calculate the sum?\",\n    \"How do you handle the remaining elements that don't form a complete cycle in the calculation?\",\n    \"What are the key data structures needed to store the repeating pattern and calculate the sum efficiently?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Given the large constraints, iterating through all numbers from 1 to `n` is not feasible. The approach must involve identifying patterns or using mathematical formulas to optimize the calculation.\",\n    \"The last digits of multiples of `m` form a repeating pattern. This pattern typically repeats every 10 multiples of `m`. The sum of the last digits within one repeating block can be calculated and reused.\",\n    \"To calculate the number of complete cycles, compute `n // m` (which is the number of multiples of m less than n). Then `(n // m) // 10` gives the number of full cycles. Multiply the sum of the repeating pattern by this number to get a partial sum.\",\n    \"The remaining elements are the ones beyond the full cycles. The number of remaining elements is `(n // m) % 10`.  Calculate the sum of the last digits of these remaining multiples and add it to the partial sum.\",\n    \"A list to store the repeating pattern of last digits is crucial.  Variables to keep track of the sum, the number of full cycles, and the number of remaining elements are also needed.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
