It contained so many different letters, that the letters were marked by numbers, but at the same time each letter could be met in the string at most 10 times. Bob didn't like that string, because it contained repeats: a repeat of length x is such a substring of length 2x, that its first half coincides character by character with its second half. Bob started deleting all the repeats from the string. He does it as follows: while it's possible, Bob takes the shortest repeat, if it is not unique, he takes the leftmost one, and deletes its left half and everything that is to the left of this repeat.\\n\\nYou're given the string seen by Bob. Find out, what it will look like after Bob deletes all the repeats in the way described above.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first input line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 105) \u2014 length of the string. The following line contains n space-separated integer numbers from 0 to 109 inclusive \u2014 numbers that stand for the letters of the string. It's guaranteed that each letter can be met in the string at most 10 times.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nIn the first line output the length of the string's part, left after Bob's deletions. In the second line output all the letters (separated by a space) of the string, left after Bob deleted all the repeats in the described way.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nInput\\n\\n6\\n1 2 3 1 2 3\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n3\\n1 2 3 \\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n7\\n4 5 6 5 6 7 7\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n1\\n7\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def pow(x, exp, mod):\\n\\tres = 1\\n\\twhile exp:\\n\\t\\tif exp & 1:\\n\\t\\t\\tres = res * x % mod\\n\\t\\tx = x * x % mod\\n\\t\\texp >>= 1\\n\\treturn res\\nMOD = 2 ** 121 - 1\\nM = int(1000000000.0) + 1\\nn = int(input())\\nvals = list(map(int, input().split()))\\ngroups = dict()\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\tgroups.setdefault(vals[i], []).append(i)\\npowsA = [1]\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\tpowsA.append(powsA[-1] * M % MOD)\\nhashes = [0] * (n + 1)\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\thashes[i + 1] = (hashes[i] * M + vals[i]) % MOD\\n\\ndef get_hash(p, l):\\n\\tres = hashes[p + l] - hashes[p] * powsA[l] % MOD\\n\\tif res < 0:\\n\\t\\tres += MOD\\n\\telif res > MOD:\\n\\t\\tres -= MOD\\n\\treturn res\\nbest = 0\\ni = 0\\nwhile i < n:\\n\\tval = vals[i]\\n\\tfor j in groups[val]:\\n\\t\\tif j <= i:\\n\\t\\t\\tcontinue\\n\\t\\tl = j - i\\n\\t\\tif j + l <= n and get_hash(i, l) == get_hash(j, l):\\n\\t\\t\\tbest = max(best, j)\\n\\t\\t\\ti = j - 1\\n\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\ti += 1\\nres = vals[best:]\\nprint(len(res))\\nprint(' '.join(map(str, res)))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires identifying and removing repeats from a given sequence of numbers. A repeat is defined as a substring of length 2x where the first half is identical to the second half. The removal process involves finding the shortest, leftmost repeat and deleting the left half and everything to the left of it.\\n- Identifying Algorithm Strategy: The algorithm should iterate through the string, checking for repeats at each position. For each position, it needs to find the shortest repeat starting from that position. Once a repeat is found, the string needs to be updated by removing the left portion of the repeat and everything to the left of it. This process continues until no more repeats exist.\\n- Data Structure Selection: A dictionary can be used to store the indices of each number, which will allow the algorithm to efficiently search for potential repeats. Hashing can be used to compare substrings in constant time.\\n- Optimizing Repeat Detection: To efficiently determine whether a substring is a repeat, a hashing technique can be applied. This can avoid direct element-by-element comparison, which would lead to a higher time complexity. Specifically, a rolling hash can be precomputed for all possible substrings.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What defines a repeat in the context of the problem, and how is it different from a simple duplicate?\",\n    \"How should you handle the case where multiple repeats of the same length exist within the string? Which one should be removed?\",\n    \"Can you suggest a method to efficiently compare substrings to determine if they are equal, especially when dealing with long substrings?\",\n    \"How do you ensure that the algorithm terminates, and what condition signals that no more repeats can be removed?\",\n    \"After identifying a repeat, what steps are necessary to update the string correctly according to the problem's requirements?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A repeat is a substring of length 2x where the first x characters are exactly the same as the next x characters. This is different from a simple duplicate because it refers to a repeating sequence of characters, not just the presence of the same character multiple times.\",\n    \"If multiple repeats of the same length exist, the leftmost one should be removed. This is a crucial part of the problem statement and dictates the order of operations.\",\n    \"A hashing technique, such as using a rolling hash or pre-computing hashes for all substrings, can allow for efficient comparison of substrings in O(1) time.\",\n    \"The algorithm terminates when there are no more repeats in the string. This can be checked by iterating through the string and attempting to find repeats at each position until no repeat is found in an entire pass.\",\n    \"After identifying a repeat at index i with length x, you need to remove the substring from the beginning of the string up to index i + x (inclusive). This involves updating the string to only contain the portion after the removed part.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
