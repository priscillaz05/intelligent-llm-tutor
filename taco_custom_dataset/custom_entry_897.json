Non-overlapping means that for any two selected intervals i and j, either interval i ends before interval j starts, or vice-versa. The goal is to maximize the total profit of the selected intervals.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints: The most important constraint is the non-overlapping requirement, meaning that once we choose an interval, we cannot choose any other interval that overlaps with it. The intervals are defined by their start and end times and associated profits.\\n- Choosing the right Algorithm/Data Structure: Sorting the intervals by their end times is a crucial initial step. Dynamic programming is a suitable approach because it allows us to build up the solution incrementally by considering smaller subproblems first. A dp array of size equal to maximum end time is used to store the optimal profit at each point.\\n- Implementation Details: Sorting the intervals by end times enables us to efficiently consider the intervals in a specific order. The dynamic programming part involves iterating through the sorted intervals and, for each interval, deciding whether including the interval will increase the overall profit. The dp[i] keeps track of the max profit till end time i. The final answer is the max profit till the maximum end time.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you define non-overlapping intervals, and why is this constraint important?\",\n    \"What is the significance of sorting the intervals by their end times?\",\n    \"How can dynamic programming be applied to solve this problem, and what subproblems will you consider?\",\n    \"How does your solution handle the cases where including an interval might not result in a higher profit?\",\n    \"What is the time and space complexity of your approach, and can you explain any bottlenecks in your solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Non-overlapping intervals are defined as intervals where the end time of one interval is less than or equal to the start time of the other interval. The non-overlapping constraint is important because it limits the number of intervals that can be included in the optimal solution.\",\n    \"Sorting by end times allows us to process intervals in such a way that when considering an interval, we already know the maximum profit achievable from non-overlapping intervals that end before the start of the current interval. This makes dynamic programming easier to implement.\",\n    \"Dynamic programming can be applied by building a table where each entry represents the maximum profit achievable up to a certain time. We consider each interval and decide whether to include it in the solution or not based on whether including it increases the overall profit, ensuring that we do not include any overlapping intervals.\",\n    \"If including an interval does not result in a higher profit (meaning the profit from the interval plus the maximum profit achievable before it is less than the current maximum profit for the end time of the interval), then the interval is not included, and we keep the current maximum profit.\",\n    \"The time complexity is dominated by sorting (O(n log n)) and the dynamic programming iteration (O(M*n)), where M is the max end time and n is no. of intervals. Space complexity is O(M) due to the dp table. The bottleneck could be the dynamic programming step if M is extremely large. We can reduce M by discretizing time.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
