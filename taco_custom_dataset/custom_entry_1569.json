There are four types of commands it can perform:  U \u2014 move from the cell (x, y) to (x, y + 1);  D \u2014 move from (x, y) to (x, y - 1);  L \u2014 move from (x, y) to (x - 1, y);  R \u2014 move from (x, y) to (x + 1, y).\\n\\nIvan entered a sequence of n commands, and the robot processed it. After this sequence the robot ended up in the starting cell (0, 0), but Ivan doubts that the sequence is such that after performing it correctly the robot ends up in the same cell. He thinks that some commands were ignored by robot. To acknowledge whether the robot is severely bugged, he needs to calculate the maximum possible number of commands that were performed correctly. Help Ivan to do the calculations!\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains one number n \u2014 the length of sequence of commands entered by Ivan (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100).\\n\\nThe second line contains the sequence itself \u2014 a string consisting of n characters.

The goal is to maximize the number of executed commands. The robot can move up, down, left, or right.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Consider cases where the number of 'U' commands doesn't match 'D' or 'L' doesn't match 'R'. Only pairs of opposite commands count toward the solution. If the counts are unequal, only some can be used to return to the origin. Edge cases, like an empty command string, also need to be considered.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Count the number of 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R' commands. The maximum number of usable 'U' and 'D' commands is twice the minimum of the count of 'U' and 'D'. Similarly, the maximum number of usable 'L' and 'R' commands is twice the minimum of the count of 'L' and 'R'. Sum these two results to get the final answer.\\n- Implementing the Solution: Read the input. Iterate through the commands and count 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'. Calculate the minimum number between 'U' and 'D', then multiply by 2. Calculate the minimum number between 'L' and 'R', then multiply by 2. Sum these two results and print the result.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do the 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R' commands affect the robot's position, and what condition must be met for the robot to return to the origin?\",\n    \"If the number of 'U' commands is not equal to the number of 'D' commands, how does this affect the calculation of the maximum number of correctly performed commands?\",\n    \"Why is it necessary to take the minimum of the count of 'U' and 'D' (and 'L' and 'R') and multiply by 2, rather than simply adding up the counts?\",\n    \"What edge cases should be considered, such as an empty sequence of commands, and how should the algorithm handle these cases?\",\n    \"Can you describe the algorithm in terms of its time and space complexity?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Each command moves the robot one unit in the corresponding direction. 'U' increases the y-coordinate, 'D' decreases the y-coordinate, 'L' decreases the x-coordinate, and 'R' increases the x-coordinate. For the robot to return to the origin (0, 0), the number of 'U' commands must equal the number of 'D' commands, and the number of 'L' commands must equal the number of 'R' commands.\",\n    \"If the number of 'U' and 'D' commands are not equal, only the smaller number of these commands can be used in pairs to return to the origin along the y-axis. The excess commands cannot be used to return to the origin, so they are not counted towards the maximum number of correctly performed commands. The same applies to 'L' and 'R'.\",\n    \"We take the minimum of 'U' and 'D' (and 'L' and 'R') because we need equal numbers of opposite direction commands to cancel each other out and bring the robot back to the origin. Multiplying by 2 accounts for the fact that each valid pair consists of one command in each direction.\",\n    \"An edge case is an empty sequence of commands. In this case, the robot is already at the origin, and the maximum number of correctly performed commands is 0. The algorithm should explicitly handle this case by returning 0 if the input string is empty.\",\n    \"The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the command string, because it iterates through the string once to count the commands. The space complexity is O(1) because it uses a fixed number of variables to store the counts, regardless of the input size.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
