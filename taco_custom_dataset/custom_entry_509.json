Return the largest-valued odd integer (as a string) that is substring of the given string S.\\nNote : A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

It emphasizes that a substring must be contiguous, and a null string is also a valid substring.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Consider the case where no odd number exists in the string. Must return an empty string in that situation. Consider how to efficiently check each substring without generating all possible substrings.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: The most efficient approach is to iterate the string backward. Once an odd digit is encountered, return the substring from the start of the string up to and including that digit.\\n- Implementing Efficient Backward Traversal: Starting from the end of the string, iterate backward until an odd digit is found. Slice the string from the beginning to the index of the odd digit + 1. If no odd digit is found, return an empty string.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean to find the largest-valued odd integer substring, and how do you define 'largest-valued' in this context?\",\n    \"What should you return if the input string contains no odd digits at all?\",\n    \"What is the most efficient way to search for the largest odd integer substring without generating every possible substring?\",\n    \"Why is iterating from the end of the string more efficient than starting from the beginning?\",\n    \"How do you construct the substring once you find an odd digit in the input string?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"It means finding the longest possible substring that represents an odd number. In terms of string comparison, the substring with more digits is considered larger, or if the lengths are equal, it means the substring representing a bigger number.\",\n    \"If the input string has no odd digits, the problem states to return an empty string.\",\n    \"The most efficient way is to iterate through the string from right to left and stop as soon as the first odd digit is encountered. This is because any substring ending with an odd digit will be an odd number, and moving from right to left ensures that we find the longest such substring first.\",\n    \"Iterating from the end ensures that the first odd digit encountered will be part of the largest possible odd substring, since the substring extends from the start to that digit. This way, we avoid checking every possible substring.\",\n    \"Once an odd digit is found at index `i`, the substring is constructed by slicing the input string from the start (index 0) to `i + 1`, as string slicing in Python excludes the upper bound index.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
