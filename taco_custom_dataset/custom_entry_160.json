At point $i$, you can do the following:\\n\\nMove left one unit: it costs $1$ coin.\\n\\nMove right one unit: it costs $1$ coin.\\n\\nUse a teleporter at point $i$, if it exists: it costs $a_i$ coins. As a result, you can choose whether to teleport to point $0$ or point $n+1$. Once you use a teleporter, you can't use it again.\\n\\nYou have $c$ coins, and you start at point $0$. What's the most number of teleporters you can use?\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 1000$) \u2014 the number of test cases.

You are left with $6-1-1-1-1 = 2$ coins, and wherever you teleport, you won't have enough coins to use another teleporter. You have used two teleporters, so the answer is two.\\n\\nIn the second test case, you go four units to the right and use the teleporter to go to $n+1$, then go three units left and use the teleporter at index $6$ to go to $n+1$, and finally, you go left four times and use the teleporter. The total cost will be $4+6+3+4+4+9 = 30$, and you used three teleporters.\\n\\nIn the third test case, you don't have enough coins to use any teleporter, so the answer is zero.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import bisect\\n\\ndef f(arr, c):\\n\\tn = len(arr)\\n\\ttotal = 0\\n\\tstart = []\\n\\tfor i in range(n):\\n\\t\\tstart.append(arr[i] + (i + 1))\\n\\t\\tarr[i] += min(i + 1, n - i)\\n\\tsorted_arr = sorted(arr)\\n\\tpref = [sorted_arr[0]]\\n\\tfor i in range(1, n):\\n\\t\\tpref.append(pref[-1] + sorted_arr[i])\\n\\tfor i in range(n):\\n\\t\\tif c - start[i] >= 0:\\n\\t\\t\\tindex = bisect.bisect_left(pref, c - start[i])\\n\\t\\t\\tif index >= n:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindex -= 1\\n\\t\\t\\tif pref[index] > c - start[i]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindex -= 1\\n\\t\\t\\tif index == -1:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttotal = max(total, 1)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontinue\\n\\t\\t\\tif sorted_arr[index] >= arr[i]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindex = index = bisect.bisect_left(pref, c - (start[i] - arr[i]))\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif index >= n:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tindex -= 1\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif pref[index] > c - (start[i] - arr[i]):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tindex -= 1\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcur = index + 1\\n\\t\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcur = index + 2\\n\\t\\t\\ttotal = max(total, cur)\\n\\treturn total\\nk = int(input())\\nres = []\\nwhile k > 0:\\n\\tnc = input().split(' ')\\n\\t(n, c) = (int(nc[0]), int(nc[1]))\\n\\ttemp = input().split(' ')\\n\\tarr = []\\n\\tfor num in temp:\\n\\t\\tarr.append(int(num))\\n\\tres.append(f(arr, c))\\n\\tk -= 1\\nfor x in res:\\n\\tprint(x)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem asks to find the maximum number of teleporters that can be used given a starting point, a cost to use each teleporter, a cost to move between points, and a total coin budget.\\n- Defining Costs:  To use a teleporter at point `i`, you need to travel from your current position to `i` and pay the teleporter cost `a_i`. Then, using a teleporter takes you to either 0 or n+1.\\n- Identifying Optimization Strategies: To maximize the number of teleporters used, it is necessary to pick teleporters with the lowest overall cost. A greedy or dynamic programming approach should be considered.\\n- Addressing Edge Cases and Constraints:  The problem involves several constraints like the coin limit, the teleporter costs, and the need to calculate the cost of moving between points. Also, the choice of teleporting to 0 or n+1 affects future costs, so this is an important optimization factor. The fact that teleporters can't be reused after use is also crucial.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the main constraints and limitations of this problem, and how do they affect the solution's design?\",\n    \"How can we represent the total cost of using a teleporter at a specific location, considering both the movement cost and the teleporter cost?\",\n    \"How does the choice of teleporting to either 0 or n+1 impact the total cost and subsequent teleporter usage?\",\n    \"What algorithmic strategy can be employed to efficiently determine the maximum number of teleporters that can be used within the given coin limit?\",\n    \"How can we handle different test cases efficiently within the provided code structure?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The main constraints are the coin limit `c`, the number of teleporters `n`, the teleporter costs `a_i`, and the cost of moving between points. These constraints dictate the need for an optimal strategy to select the most teleporters within the budget.\",\n    \"The total cost of using a teleporter at location `i` includes the cost to travel from the current position (0 initially, and potentially 0 or n+1 after teleporting) to `i` plus the teleporter cost `a_i`. This also includes choosing whether to teleport to 0 or n+1, which will determine future travel costs.\",\n    \"The choice of teleporting to either 0 or n+1 after using a teleporter affects the subsequent cost of reaching other teleporters. Choosing the closer endpoint for future teleporters might save coins and allow for using more teleporters overall.\",\n    \"A greedy or dynamic programming approach can be employed. A possible greedy strategy involves sorting teleporters by their total cost (movement + teleporter cost), and then iterating through the sorted list, picking teleporters as long as the coin limit is not exceeded. A dynamic programming approach might involve building a table representing the maximum number of teleporters used with varying coin amounts and positions.\",\n    \"The code iterates through each test case. The input for each case includes `n`, `c`, and an array of teleporter costs. Efficiently processing each test case within the loop and storing the results in a list ensures correct output for all cases.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
