He decided to generate a random permutation this way: he takes identity permutation of numbers from 1 to n and then 3n times takes a random pair of different elements and swaps them. Alex envies Petr and tries to imitate him in all kind of things. Alex has also come up with a problem about random permutation. He generates a random permutation just like Petr but swaps elements 7n+1 times instead of 3n times. Because it is more random, OK?!\\n\\nYou somehow get a test from one of these problems and now you want to know from which one.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nIn the first line of input there is one integer n (10^{3} \u2264 n \u2264 10^{6}).\\n\\nIn the second line there are n distinct integers between 1 and n \u2014 the permutation of size n from the test.\\n\\nIt is guaranteed that all tests except for sample are generated this way: First we choose n \u2014 the size of the permutation. Then we randomly choose a method to generate a permutation \u2014 the one of Petr or the one of Alex. Then we generate a permutation using chosen method.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nIf the test is generated via Petr's method print \\\"Petr\\\" (without quotes). If the test is generated via Alex's method print \\\"Um_nik\\\" (without quotes).\\n\\nExample\\n\\nInput\\n\\n5\\n2 4 5 1 3\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nPetr\\n\\nNote\\n\\nPlease note that the sample is not a valid test (because of limitations for n) and is given only to illustrate input/output format.

The key is to analyze the permutation and infer the number of swaps performed.\\n- Identifying Cycles: A permutation can be decomposed into cycles. The number of swaps needed to sort a cycle of length k is k-1. The total number of swaps needed to generate a permutation is the sum of (k-1) for all cycles.\\n- Parity Check: The difference between the number of swaps performed by Petr and Alex is 7n+1 - 3n = 4n+1, which is always odd. So, we need to determine the parity of the number of swaps required to obtain the given permutation from the identity permutation.\\n- Cycle Detection and Counting: Decompose the given permutation into disjoint cycles. For each cycle of length k, it takes k-1 swaps to transform it back to the identity permutation. Sum up all (k-1) to get the total number of swaps. Then take modulo 2 of this sum and compare it with 3n mod 2.  If they are equal, print Petr, otherwise, print Um_nik.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the relationship between the number of cycles in a permutation and the number of swaps required to generate it from the identity permutation?\",\n    \"How can you decompose a given permutation into disjoint cycles?\",\n    \"What is the parity difference between the number of swaps performed by Petr and Alex?\",\n    \"How does the parity of the number of swaps relate to the final answer (Petr or Um_nik)?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"If a permutation can be decomposed into cycles of lengths k1, k2, ..., km, then the number of swaps required to generate it from the identity permutation is (k1-1) + (k2-1) + ... + (km-1).\",\n    \"Start with an element, say 1.
