In between cooking two of them, he decided to relax and play a card game with his friend.\\n\\nThe game is played with cards that have integer *ranks* written on them. There may be multiple cards with the same rank. At the beginning of the game, Chef gets $N$ cards with ranks $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\\\ldots, a_{N}$ and his friend gets $N$ cards with ranks $b_{1}, b_{2}, \\\\ldots, b_{N}$.\\n\\nThe game is played in turns. The players alternate turns and in each turn, one player is the *attacker* and the other is the *defender*. In the first turn, Chef is the attacker. The roles in each subsequent turn depend on the result of the previous turn.\\n\\nIn each turn, the attacker chooses one of his cards and puts it on the table. The defender must either give up this turn or beat this card by choosing one of his cards with a strictly higher rank and putting it on the table. Then, the attacker must give up the turn or choose another of his cards such that its rank is equal to the rank of any card on the table, then the defender must give up or beat this card, and so on until one player gives up the turn. If both players still have cards afterwards, the game proceeds to the next turn with the following rules:\\nIf the attacker gave up, all cards on the table are discarded. In the next turn, the roles of the players are swapped: the attacker becomes the defender and vice versa.\\nIf the defender gave up, he takes all cards on the table, which he can use in the subsequent turns just like the remaining cards which he did not put on the table. In the next turn, the roles are left unchanged.\\n\\nThe game ends when at least one player does not have any cards at the start of some turn. If the attacker gave up the last turn and both players do not have any cards, a draw is announced. Otherwise, the player that ran out of cards wins.\\n\\nChef and his friend want to end the game with a draw. Determine if they can do that.\\n\\nNote that there are two subtasks and your goals in them are different: in the first subtask, Chef does not have much time, so the goal is to get a draw in one turn, while in the second subtask, it is sufficient to get a draw in any number of turns.\\n\\n------  Input ------\\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $T$ and $S$ denoting the number of test cases and the subtask.

All cards are discarded afterwards.\\n\\nExample case 2: At least two turns are necessary to reach a draw. In the first turn, Chef can choose a card with rank $1$, his friend can beat it with a card with rank $3$, then Chef can choose a card with rank $3$ and his friend can beat it with a card with rank $5$. Then, Chef gives up and all these cards are discarded. In the next turn, Chef's friend is the attacker, he chooses the last card with rank $2$ and Chef can beat it with his last card with rank $4$.\\n\\nExample case 3: The game can end in a draw in five turns as follows:\\nChef chooses a card with rank $5$ and his friend gives up and takes it.\\nChef chooses a card with rank $4$ and his friend beats it with a card with rank $5$. Chef gives up and both cards are discarded.\\nChef's friend chooses a card with rank $1$, Chef takes it.\\nChef's friend chooses a card with rank $2$, Chef beats it with a card with rank $6$.\\nChef chooses a card with rank $1$ and his friend beats it with a card with rank $3$.\\n\\nExample case 4: It is impossible to reach a draw at all.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def shift(a, l, r):\\n\\tcarry = a[l]\\n\\ta[l] = a[r]\\n\\tfor i in range(l + 1, r + 1):\\n\\t\\ttemp = carry\\n\\t\\tcarry = a[i]\\n\\t\\ta[i] = temp\\n(t, s) = map(int, input().split())\\nans = ['' for i in range(t)]\\nfor i in range(t):\\n\\tn = int(input())\\n\\tarr = list(map(int, input().split()))\\n\\tbrr = list(map(int, input().split()))\\n\\tarr.sort()\\n\\tbrr.sort()\\n\\tif s == 1:\\n\\t\\tflag = True\\n\\t\\tdic1 = {}\\n\\t\\tdic2 = {}\\n\\t\\tfor j in brr:\\n\\t\\t\\tdic2[j] = 1\\n\\t\\tif brr[0] <= arr[0]:\\n\\t\\t\\tflag = False\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tdic1[arr[0]] = 1\\n\\t\\t\\tdic1[brr[0]] = 1\\n\\t\\t\\tfor j in range(1, n):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttry:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ta = dic1[arr[j]]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tif brr[j] <= arr[j]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tflag = False\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdic1[brr[j]] = 1\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texcept:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttry:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ta = dic2[arr[j]]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfor k in range(j, n):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tif brr[k] == arr[j]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tshift(brr, j, k)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tif brr[j] <= arr[j]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tflag = False\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdic1[arr[j]] = 1\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdic1[brr[j]] = 1\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\texcept:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tflag = False\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\t\\tif flag:\\n\\t\\t\\tans[i] = 'YES'\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tans[i] = 'NO'\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tflag = True\\n\\t\\tdic = {}\\n\\t\\tfor j in arr:\\n\\t\\t\\ttry:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdic[j] += 1\\n\\t\\t\\texcept:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdic[j] = 1\\n\\t\\tfor j in brr:\\n\\t\\t\\ttry:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdic[j] += 1\\n\\t\\t\\texcept:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdic[j] = 1\\n\\t\\tfor j in dic:\\n\\t\\t\\tif dic[j] > n:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tflag = False\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\t\\tif flag:\\n\\t\\t\\tasame = 1\\n\\t\\t\\tbsame = 1\\n\\t\\t\\tasmall = 1\\n\\t\\t\\tbsmall = 1\\n\\t\\t\\tcrr = [0 for j in range(2 * n)]\\n\\t\\t\\tcounter = 0\\n\\t\\t\\tfor j in arr:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcrr[counter] = j\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcounter += 1\\n\\t\\t\\tfor j in brr:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcrr[counter] = j\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcounter += 1\\n\\t\\t\\tcrr.sort()\\n\\t\\t\\tfor j in range(n):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif crr[j] != arr[j]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tasmall = 0\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\t\\t\\tfor j in range(n):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif crr[j] != brr[j]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbsmall = 0\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\t\\t\\tfor j in arr:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif j != arr[0]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tasame = 0\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\t\\t\\tfor j in brr:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif j != brr[0]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbsame = 0\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\t\\t\\tif n == 2:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif arr[1] == brr[0]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tflag = True\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telif asame == 1 and asmall == 1:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tflag = True\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telif asmall + bsmall == 0:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tflag = True\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tflag = False\\n\\t\\t\\telif bsmall * (asame + bsame) != 0:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tflag = False\\n\\t\\tif flag:\\n\\t\\t\\tans[i] = 'YES'\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tans[i] = 'NO'\\nfor i in ans:\\n\\tprint(i)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Game Rules: The game involves two players, Chef and his friend, who play cards in turns. The goal is to determine if they can reach a draw where both run out of cards.\\n- Identifying Subtasks: Recognize the two subtasks: (1) achieve a draw in one turn, and (2) achieve a draw in any number of turns.\\n- Analyzing Subtask 1 (Draw in one turn): This requires Chef to start as the attacker, and each of Chef's cards must be beaten by the friend's card, and the friend must also run out of cards in that one turn. This requires sorting both players' cards and ensuring that each card Chef plays is strictly smaller than the corresponding card played by the friend.\\n- Analyzing Subtask 2 (Draw in any number of turns):  For a draw to be possible in any number of turns, the total number of occurrences of each card rank must be less than or equal to N. This ensures neither player can have all the cards of a single rank, preventing one player from always defending or attacking.\\n- Addressing Edge Cases: Handle cases like when the arrays have duplicate values and when N=2 to determine the edge cases. Consider the possible moves and strategies to lead to a draw.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"For subtask 1, how do you ensure a draw in one turn, and what conditions must be satisfied by Chef's and his friend's cards?\",\n    \"For subtask 2, what properties must the combined set of card ranks have to make a draw possible in any number of turns?\",\n    \"In subtask 1, how do you handle cases where the cards are not sorted, and what adjustments might be needed?\",\n    \"How do you handle the condition where a player may 'give up' a turn, and how does this affect the subsequent turns and roles of the players?\",\n    \"If there are duplicate card ranks, how does it change the strategy for both subtask 1 and subtask 2?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"In subtask 1, sort both players' cards. Each of Chef's cards must be strictly less than his friend's corresponding card. This means a[i] < b[i] for all i from 0 to N-1.\",\n    \"In subtask 2, the count of each distinct card rank must be less than or equal to N. If any rank appears more than N times in the combined set of cards, it's impossible to reach a draw, because one player will always have more cards than the other.\",\n    \"If the cards are not initially sorted, sorting is a necessary preprocessing step to ensure that Chef's cards are always less than his friend's cards in the right order.\",\n    \"If a player gives up, the roles change (attacker becomes defender) or remain the same (attacker remains attacker) for the next turn. Cards on the table are discarded or taken depending on who gives up the turn. This will affect subsequent turns and strategies.\",\n    \"Duplicate card ranks can affect possible strategies. In subtask 1, it can be handled by adjusting the positions of friend's card to ensure a[i] < b[i]. In subtask 2, duplicate card ranks require ensuring that the count of each rank doesn't exceed N for a draw to be possible.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
