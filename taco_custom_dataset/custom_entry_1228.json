The land it has chosen incidentaly has some abandoned college buildings which IIST wants to use. The administration decide the value of the building based on the amount of work that has to be done to get it in shape (lower amount of work, higher value). The security experts want to tear down some of the buildings and use the bricks to build a boundary wall. \\n\\nThe director has chosen you to write a program which determines the buildings which needs to be demolished to maximise the value while fulfilling the above criterion. \\n\\nInput Format: \\n\\nThe first line contains the number of test cases, T.\\n\\nThe next T cases contains information about hypothetical plots.\\n\\nEach test case starts with a single integer n, 2 \u2264 n \u2264 15, the number of abandoned buildings in the plot. The buildings are identified by consecutive integers 1 to n. Each of the subsequent lines contains 4 integers x_i , y_i , v_i , l_i that describe a single building. (x_i, y_i) is the position of the building in the plane, v_i is its value, and l_i is the length of boundary wall that can be built using the bricks from the building. v_i and l_i are between 0 and 10,000.\\n\\nOutput Format:\\n\\nFor each test case, compute a subset of the buildings such that, using the bricks from the buildings from that subset, the remaining buildings can be enclosed in a single boundary. Find the subset with a minimum value. If more than one such minimum-value subset exists, choose one with the smallest number of buildings. \\n\\nDisplay, as shown below, the identity of each building to be demolished, and the length of the excess boundary (accurate to two fractional digits).\\n\\nSample Input:  \\n\\n2\\n\\n6\\n\\n0 0 8 3\\n\\n1 4 3 2\\n\\n2 1 7 1\\n\\n4 1 2 3\\n\\n3 5 4 6\\n\\n2 3 9 8\\n\\n3\\n\\n3 0 10 2\\n\\n5 5 20 25\\n\\n7 -3 30 32\\n\\nSample Output: \\n\\n2 4 5\\n\\n3.16\\n\\n2\\n\\n15.00\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import math\\nfrom itertools import permutations as p\\n\\ndef diff(li1, li2):\\n\\tli_dif = [i for i in li1 if i not in li2]\\n\\treturn li_dif\\n\\ndef segments(b):\\n\\tpoly = [(i[0], i[1]) for i in b]\\n\\treturn zip(poly, poly[1:] + [poly[0]])\\n\\ndef perimeter(poly):\\n\\treturn abs(sum((math.hypot(x0 - x1, y0 - y1) for ((x0, y0), (x1, y1)) in segments(poly))))\\n\\ndef av(b):\\n\\treturn sum([i[3] for i in b])\\n\\ndef val(b):\\n\\treturn sum([i[2] for i in b])\\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\\n\\tb = []\\n\\tfor _ in range(int(input())):\\n\\t\\tb.append(list(map(int, input().split())))\\n\\tperm = []\\n\\tfor i in range(1, len(b)):\\n\\t\\tfor e in p(b, i):\\n\\t\\t\\tperm.append(e)\\n\\tperm.sort(key=lambda x: val(x))\\n\\tyes = []\\n\\tfor i in perm:\\n\\t\\tif av(i) >= perimeter(diff(b, i)):\\n\\t\\t\\tgood = val(i)\\n\\t\\t\\tyes.append(i)\\n\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\tprint(' '.join([str(b.index(i) + 1) for i in yes[0]]))\\n\\tx = round(av(yes[0]) - perimeter(diff(b, yes[0])), 2)\\n\\tprint(f'{x:.2f}')\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The goal is to determine which buildings to demolish to minimize the value lost while ensuring the remaining buildings can be enclosed by a boundary wall constructed from the demolished buildings' bricks. The primary optimization is minimizing the value of demolished buildings, with a secondary optimization of minimizing the number of demolished buildings if multiple solutions have the same value.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints: The length of the boundary wall built from demolished buildings must be greater than or equal to the perimeter of the polygon formed by the remaining buildings. The problem involves finding a subset of buildings to demolish.\\n- Choosing an Algorithmic Approach: An exhaustive search or a greedy algorithm combined with some heuristics is a good option since n <= 15. We'll need to generate all possible subsets of buildings that can be demolished. For each subset, we check if the total length of the wall that can be built from the demolished buildings is enough to enclose the remaining buildings. If it does, we evaluate based on the value and size of the subset.\\n- Implementing Geometric Calculations: Calculating the perimeter of the buildings that are remaining requires the use of the distance formula (Euclidean distance) between building positions. Implementing the perimeter calculation correctly is crucial.\\n- Optimizing for Multiple Solutions: If multiple subsets satisfy the condition (wall length >= perimeter), choose the subset with the smallest total value. If there are still multiple subsets with the same value, choose the one with the fewest buildings demolished.\\n- Edge Cases: Consider cases where all buildings must be demolished (perimeter is zero).\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you calculate the perimeter of the remaining buildings given their coordinates?\",\n    \"How do you generate all possible subsets of buildings to demolish efficiently?\",\n    \"How do you compare different subsets of buildings to demolish, prioritizing the minimum value and then the smallest number of buildings?\",\n    \"How do you handle the edge case where all buildings must be demolished to meet the condition?\",\n    \"How can you optimize the computation of the perimeter, given that the number of buildings is relatively small (n <= 15)?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The perimeter is calculated by summing the Euclidean distances between the coordinates of adjacent buildings in the remaining set. The buildings can be treated as vertices of a polygon, and the perimeter is the sum of the lengths of its sides. The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2).\",\n    \"One way to generate all possible subsets efficiently is using bit manipulation. Since n <= 15, you can represent each subset as a binary number where each bit corresponds to a building. If the bit is set to 1, the building is included in the subset; otherwise, it's not. Iterate from 0 to 2^n - 1, and for each number, create a corresponding subset.\",\n    \"You can compare subsets based on their total value (sum of the values of demolished buildings). If two subsets have the same total value, compare them based on the number of demolished buildings. The subset with the smaller value is preferred, and if the values are equal, the subset with the fewer buildings is preferred.\",\n    \"If demolishing all buildings satisfies the condition, the perimeter of the remaining buildings is 0. This might be the optimal solution if the total value of all buildings is small. You should include this scenario in your search.\",\n    \"Since n is small, you can precompute the distances between all pairs of buildings or use straightforward methods since the impact on execution time will be minor.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
