Array $b$ is sorted in ascending order ($b_i < b_{i + 1}$ for each $i$ from $1$ to $m - 1$).\\n\\nYou have to divide the array $a$ into $m$ consecutive subarrays so that, for each $i$ from $1$ to $m$, the minimum on the $i$-th subarray is equal to $b_i$. Note that each element belongs to exactly one subarray, and they are formed in such a way: the first several elements of $a$ compose the first subarray, the next several elements of $a$ compose the second subarray, and so on.\\n\\nFor example, if $a = [12, 10, 20, 20, 25, 30]$ and $b = [10, 20, 30]$ then there are two good partitions of array $a$:   $[12, 10, 20], [20, 25], [30]$;  $[12, 10], [20, 20, 25], [30]$. \\n\\nYou have to calculate the number of ways to divide the array $a$.

The array 'b' is sorted in ascending order. The goal is to find the number of ways to divide 'a' satisfying this condition, modulo 998244353.\\n- Identifying Constraints and Edge Cases: The lengths of arrays 'a' and 'b' are up to 2 * 10^5. The values in the arrays are up to 10^9. The array 'b' is sorted in ascending order. We need to handle cases where no valid partition exists, which would result in 0.\\n- Choosing an Approach: The solution iterates backward through the array 'a', using a suffix minimum array to efficiently determine the minimum element in the potential subarrays from each index onwards. It compares the suffix minimum with the required minimum values in array 'b' to count valid ways to split the array 'a' into subarrays.\\n- Implementing the Solution: A suffix minimum array `suf` is constructed. The code then iterates backward through the `suf` array comparing values with elements of array `b`. Variables `cr` and `ct` keep track of the current index in `b` and the count of possible split points respectively. Each valid partition increments a counter, and the number of ways is calculated through modulo multiplication.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for the array 'b' to be sorted in ascending order, and how does it affect our approach to the problem?\",\n    \"How would you define a 'suffix minimum array' for array 'a', and how would that help find the minimum value of a subarray ending at a particular index?\",\n    \"What are the necessary conditions for a partition of array 'a' to be valid, according to array 'b'?\",\n    \"When iterating through the suffix minimum array, how can we identify the locations where we can potentially split array 'a' into valid subarrays?\",\n    \"In what situations would it not be possible to form a valid partition of array 'a' given array 'b', and how would the code identify such situations?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Since array 'b' is sorted, it means that each element `b[i]` is strictly less than `b[i+1]`. This means the minimum values of subarrays in 'a' must also be strictly increasing as we proceed through the partition.\",\n    \"The suffix minimum array `suf[i]` is the minimum value in 'a' from index i to the end of 'a'. `suf[i] = min(a[i], a[i+1], ..., a[n-1])`. This helps us determine the minimum of a potential subarray ending at a given split point efficiently.\",\n    \"For a partition to be valid, for each i-th subarray, the minimum value within that subarray must be exactly equal to `b[i]`.\",\n    \"While iterating through `suf`, we look for indices where `suf[i]` is equal to the required minimum `b[cr]` for the current subarray.  When `suf[i]` is less than `b[cr]`, a new subarray must begin prior to index `i`, and `ct` stores the number of choices where the split can be placed.\",\n    \"A valid partition is not possible if the constructed array 'b' does not align with the array 'a', which can occur if (1) at any point, there is no index `i` such that `suf[i] == b[cr]`. This means we cannot satisfy the minimum value requirement for the current subarray. (2) If at the end, not all elements of b have been matched (cr != -1), then return 0.  (3) If ct == 0 and a split needs to happen, then that is an error.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
