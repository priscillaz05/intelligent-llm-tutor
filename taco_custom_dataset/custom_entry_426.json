This informs the choice of data structures and algorithms. An efficient approach is needed to avoid TLE.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: A boolean array/list `ok` can be used to mark numbers as divisible or not divisible by smaller numbers. We iterate through the sorted unique elements of the sequence.  For each element, we mark its multiples as divisible.  If an element is not marked as divisible by any smaller number and its count is exactly 1 (i.e., it is not a duplicate), it's a valid number, and we increment the count.\\n- Implementation Considerations: The need to handle duplicate numbers arises. Sorting the input array helps in processing the numbers efficiently. Using a dictionary to count the occurrences of each number is important for counting only unique numbers.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the core condition for a number in the sequence to be counted towards the final answer?\",\n    \"How do the constraints influence the choice of algorithm and data structures?\",\n    \"Why is it necessary to consider the duplicates in the sequence, and how does the proposed solution handle them?\",\n    \"How does the boolean array help in efficiently determining whether a number is divisible by any other number in the sequence?\",\n    \"What are the potential bottlenecks in terms of time complexity, and how does the solution address them?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A number should be counted if no other number in the sequence divides it.\",\n    \"The size of N (up to 2 * 10^5) and A_i (up to 10^6) suggests using efficient data structures and algorithms to avoid exceeding the time limit.
