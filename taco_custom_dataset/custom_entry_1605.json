We need to generate Fibonacci numbers, check if they are even, and add them to the sum if they meet the condition.\\n- Identifying Key Properties of Fibonacci Numbers: Note that every third Fibonacci number is even. This optimization can significantly reduce the number of calculations.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Employ an iterative approach to generate Fibonacci numbers until a number greater than N is found. Utilize the property that even Fibonacci numbers occur at indices that are multiples of 3.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Initialize the first few Fibonacci numbers and an accumulator to store the sum of even Fibonacci numbers. Iterate, calculating the next even Fibonacci number using the fib(3*n) formula and adding to the sum until the number exceeds N.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the Fibonacci numbers and how are they generated?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: Fibonacci numbers start with 1 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers.\",\n    \"What are the conditions that a Fibonacci number must satisfy to be included in the final sum?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: A Fibonacci number must be even and less than or equal to the input number N.\",\n    \"How can you optimize the generation of Fibonacci numbers to find only the even ones?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: Since every third Fibonacci number is even, you can generate every third number and only check these.\",\n    \"What initial values are needed to start generating the Fibonacci sequence?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: You need the first two Fibonacci numbers, 1 and 1, or the first even Fibonacci number which is 2 if generating every third number.\",\n    \"How do you efficiently generate only the even Fibonacci numbers based on the property that every third Fibonacci number is even?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: Use the property that fib(3n) is always even to generate only even numbers and check if they are <= N.
