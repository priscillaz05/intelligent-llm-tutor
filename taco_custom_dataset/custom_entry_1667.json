This needs to be done efficiently, considering potentially large input sizes.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: A standard LIS algorithm only provides the length of the LIS, not necessarily the LIS that maximizes the sum. The challenge is to find an LIS that yields the largest sum among all possible LISes.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: The standard dynamic programming approach for LIS needs to be adapted. Consider storing not only the length of the LIS ending at each index but also the maximum sum achievable for an LIS of that length. A combination of dynamic programming and binary search could be used to optimize the process.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Need to store the longest increasing subsequence ending at the current element. Keep track of the sums and the subsequences that lead to those sums. Also, edge cases like empty arrays or arrays with only decreasing elements must be considered.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the key properties of a longest increasing subsequence (LIS), and how does finding the LIS that maximizes the sum differ from a standard LIS problem?\",\n    \"If there are multiple LISes, how do you ensure that you're selecting the one with the maximum sum?\",\n    \"What algorithmic approach might efficiently find the LIS and compute its sum in a single traversal or a minimal number of passes through the input array?\",\n    \"What data structures could be employed to store intermediate calculations, such as LIS lengths and subsequence sums, to facilitate efficient lookup and updates during the traversal?\",\n    \"What edge cases or specific input scenarios would demand special attention during the algorithm's implementation?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"An LIS is an increasing subsequence of maximum length within a given sequence. In this case, we want to find the LIS for which the sum of its elements is the maximum among all possible LISes.\",\n    \"To ensure selecting the LIS with the maximum sum, keep track of the maximum sum encountered so far and update it whenever a longer LIS or an LIS with a greater sum is found.\",\n    \"Dynamic programming combined with binary search can efficiently find the LIS and compute its sum.
