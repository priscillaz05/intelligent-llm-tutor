The sum replaces the two digits. We want to find the reduction that yields the largest possible result.\\n- Identifying the Key Strategy: To maximize the resulting number, we should start from the rightmost digits. If the sum of two digits is greater than or equal to 10, then replace those digits. If no such pair exists, take the first two digits.\\n- Edge Cases and Constraints: The input number doesn't contain leading zeros. The input number x is between 10 and 10^200000. The sum should not have leading zeros.\\n- Optimization: The best strategy is to find the rightmost pair of digits that sums to 10 or more, then replace them with the sum.
