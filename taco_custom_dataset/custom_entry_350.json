The goal is to find the original Dracula, who is slightly heavier than the others, using a balance scale before the Earth Five warriors defeat him.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nN\\n\\nThe integer N (2 \u2264 N \u2264 2,000,000,000) is written on the first line of the input.

Each weighing compares the weights of groups of Draculas on the left and right sides of the balance.\\n- Selecting an Algorithm:  The most efficient approach is a ternary search strategy. This involves dividing the Draculas into three groups and comparing two of the groups on the balance scale. This allows us to narrow down the potential location of the original Dracula to one of the three groups.  Specifically, each weighing effectively triples the number of draculas that can be handled.\\n- Optimizing the Solution: The goal is to determine the smallest number of weighings (k) such that 3^k >= N. This guarantees that the original Dracula can be found among N individuals.\\n- Edge cases and Optimization: The program avoids direct calculation of logarithms. Instead it uses a multiplication approach for faster computations. It incrementally multiplies n by 3 until it becomes greater than or equal to N.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the most efficient approach to find a slightly heavier item among N identical items using a balance scale?\",\n    \"How does a balance scale comparison help narrow down the search space for the heavier item?\",\n    \"Why is the ternary approach more efficient than binary search in this scenario?\",\n    \"How can you determine the minimum number of weighings required for a given number of Draculas (N)?\",\n    \"How can the code calculate the number of weighings efficiently without using logarithms?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The most efficient approach is a ternary search, which involves dividing the items into three groups and comparing the weight of two of the groups.\",\n    \"A balance scale comparison reveals which group contains the heavier item (or if it's in the group not weighed), thus narrowing down the search space by a factor of three with each weighing.\",\n    \"Because the balance scale has three possible outcomes (left heavier, right heavier, or equal), a ternary approach is more suitable, whereas a binary search is best suited to scenarios with two outcomes.\",\n    \"The minimum number of weighings can be determined by finding the smallest integer k such that 3^k >= N.\",\n    \"The code iteratively multiplies n by 3 and increments the answer until n is greater than or equal to N.
