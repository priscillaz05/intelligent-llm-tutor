Rows and columns of this board are numbered from 1 to n. The cell on the intersection of the r-th row and c-th column is denoted by (r, c).\\n\\nSome cells on the board are called blocked zones. On each cell of the board, there is written one of the following 5 characters \u2014 U, D, L, R or X \u2014 instructions for the player. Suppose that the current cell is (r, c). If the character is R, the player should move to the right cell (r, c+1), for L the player should move to the left cell (r, c-1), for U the player should move to the top cell (r-1, c), for D the player should move to the bottom cell (r+1, c). Finally, if the character in the cell is X, then this cell is the blocked zone. The player should remain in this cell (the game for him isn't very interesting from now on).\\n\\nIt is guaranteed that the characters are written in a way that the player will never have to step outside of the board, no matter at which cell he starts.\\n\\nAs a player starts from a cell, he moves according to the character in the current cell. The player keeps moving until he lands in a blocked zone. It is also possible that the player will keep moving infinitely long.\\n\\nFor every of the n^2 cells of the board Alice, your friend, wants to know, how will the game go, if the player starts in this cell. For each starting cell of the board, she writes down the cell that the player stops at, or that the player never stops at all. She gives you the information she has written: for each cell (r, c) she wrote: \\n\\n  * a pair (x,y), meaning if a player had started at (r, c), he would end up at cell (x,y). \\n  * or a pair (-1,-1), meaning if a player had started at (r, c), he would keep moving infinitely long and would never enter the blocked zone. \\n\\n\\nIt might be possible that Alice is trying to fool you and there's no possible grid that satisfies all the constraints Alice gave you. For the given information Alice provided you, you are required to decipher a possible board, or to determine that such a board doesn't exist. If there exist several different boards that satisfy the provided information, you can find any of them.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^{3}) \u2014 the side of the board.\\n\\nThe i-th of the next n lines of the input contains 2n integers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, ..., x_n, y_n, where (x_j, y_j) (1 \u2264 x_j \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 y_j \u2264 n, or (x_j,y_j)=(-1,-1)) is the pair written by Alice for the cell (i, j). \\n\\nOutput\\n\\nIf there doesn't exist a board satisfying the information that Alice gave you, print a single line containing INVALID. \\n\\nOtherwise, in the first line print VALID. In the i-th of the next n lines, print the string of n characters, corresponding to the characters in the i-th row of the suitable board you found. Each character of a string can either be U, D, L, R or X.

Each cell contains a character (U, D, L, R, or X) that dictates the movement of a player. The goal is to determine a valid board configuration, given the final destination of a player starting from each cell, as provided by Alice.  The destination can also be (-1, -1), indicating an infinite loop.\\n- Identifying the core constraints:  The primary constraint is that the board configuration must be consistent with Alice's provided end states.  If a cell contains 'R', the player must move right, and the reported end state must be reachable by following the board instructions. Another significant constraint is that the game board is n x n, so the moves should not lead the player outside the grid.\\n- Devise a high-level strategy: The overall approach involves first initializing the board with empty strings. Then, we look for cells where the player ends at the same cell they start from. These cells can be marked with 'X'.  After marking all 'X' cells, a breadth-first search (BFS) can be initiated to infer the direction characters (U, D, L, R) on other cells based on the known end states. Finally, validate the board to ensure it is possible to reach the destination by following the board characters. Handle infinite loops as (-1, -1).\\n- Handling edge cases and invalid inputs:  The cases where Alice's information is contradictory or results in players going off-board or not having a valid move based on their destination should be carefully handled and INVALID should be printed if these occur. A cell with a specified destination but an unassigned direction should be set. Also handle the infinite loop scenario (-1, -1).\\n- Algorithm Implementation: We can start by finding all cells marked with 'X'. From there, use a queue to find other cells that have these 'X' cells as their end point and assign characters such as 'U', 'D', 'L' or 'R'. If there are still unassigned cells after this BFS, then the configuration is invalid.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How should the board representation be structured, and what initial values should each cell contain?\",\n    \"How can we handle the edge case where a player's starting point is the same as their ending point?\",\n    \"How would you systematically deduce the direction characters (U, D, L, R) for other cells based on known end states and 'X' positions?\",\n    \"What validation steps should be taken after constructing the board to ensure it satisfies all of Alice's constraints?\",\n    \"How do we address and represent cells with infinite loops as described by the (-1, -1) condition?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The board can be represented as a 2D array (list of lists) where each cell initially contains an empty string. This allows us to populate it with 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', or 'X' as we determine them.\",\n    \"If a player's starting point is the same as their ending point, this indicates a blocked zone. The corresponding cell should be marked with 'X'.\",\n    \"A breadth-first search (BFS) can be used, starting from the 'X' cells. For each 'X' cell, examine its neighboring cells (up, down, left, right). If a neighbor's specified end state is the same as the 'X' cell, assign the appropriate direction character (e.g., 'U' if the neighbor is below the 'X' cell).\",\n    \"After board construction, for each cell, simulate the player's movements based on the assigned character. If the player ends up at the location Alice provided, or if there is a specified loop (-1,-1) then this portion of board satisfies the constriants. If they do not match the provided end state, the configuration is invalid.\",\n    \"Cells with infinite loops, where the provided destination is (-1, -1), should have characters assigned in such a way that the simulated movement will not result in the player landing on a cell marked 'X', and also doesn't result in stepping off the board.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
