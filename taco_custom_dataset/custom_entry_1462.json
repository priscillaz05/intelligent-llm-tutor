Chef has $N$ integers with him. To stop Doof, Chef has to find an odd number which is an integer multiple of all $N$ numbers that he has with him. Find if it is possible for Chef to prevent Dr Doof from destroying the even numbers.\\nFormally, given $N$ positive integers, find if there exists an odd number which is an integer multiple of all the given $N$ numbers. If yes, print \\\"YES\\\", otherwise \\\"NO\\\". You can print any letter in any case.\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n- First line contains $T$, number of testcases. Each testcase consists of $2$ lines.\\n- The first line of each test case consists of a positive integer $N$, denoting the number of positive integers Chef has.\\n- The second line of each test case contains $N$ space separated integers $A_i$ each denoting an integer that Chef has with him.\\n\\n-----Output-----\\nFor every test case, if there exists such an odd number, print \\\"YES\\\" on a separate line, otherwise \\\"NO\\\". The judge is case insensitive.

Only when all the numbers are odd can the LCM be odd.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Determine if all the given numbers are odd. If they are, then an odd multiple exists (the LCM itself). If at least one number is even, then no odd multiple is possible.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Consider the case when N is 1. If the single number is odd, the answer is \\\"YES\\\". If it's even, the answer is \\\"NO\\\".\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What condition must be satisfied for the existence of an odd number that is a multiple of all N given numbers?\",\n    \"How does the presence of even numbers in the input affect the possibility of finding an odd multiple?\",\n    \"What is the significance of the Least Common Multiple (LCM) in determining the existence of the odd multiple?\",\n    \"What special considerations need to be made for the case when N = 1?\",\n    \"How would you implement an efficient check to determine if all numbers in the input are odd?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"All the N given numbers must be odd.\",\n    \"If at least one number is even, the LCM of the numbers will also be even, making it impossible to find an odd multiple.\",\n    \"If all given numbers are odd, their LCM will also be odd, and the LCM can serve as the required odd multiple.\",\n    \"If N = 1, you just need to check whether that single number is odd or even.
