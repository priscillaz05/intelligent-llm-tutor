Whenever the geek jumps from stair i to stair j, the energy consumed in the jump is abs(height[i]- height[j]), where abs() means the absolute difference. return the minimum energy that can be used by the Geek to jump from stair 0 to stair N-1.\\nExample:\\nInput:\\nn = 4\\nheight = {10 20 30 10}\\nOutput:\\n20\\nExplanation:\\nGeek jump from 1st to 2nd stair(|20-10| = 10 energy lost).\\nThen a jump from the 2nd to the last stair(|10-20| = 10 energy lost).\\nso, total energy lost is 20 which is the minimum.\\nYour Task:\\nYou don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function MinimumEnergy() which takes the array height, and integer n, and returns the minimum energy that is lost.\\nExpected Time Complexity: O(n)\\nExpected Space Complexity: O(n)\\nConstraint:\\n1<=n<=100000\\n1<=height[i]<=1000\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import sys\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n\\n\\tdef minimumEnergy(self, height, n):\\n\\t\\tprev = 0\\n\\t\\tprev2 = 0\\n\\t\\tfor i in range(1, n, 1):\\n\\t\\t\\tfirst = prev + abs(height[i] - height[i - 1])\\n\\t\\t\\tsecond = sys.maxsize\\n\\t\\t\\tif i > 1:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsecond = prev2 + abs(height[i] - height[i - 2])\\n\\t\\t\\tcurr = min(first, second)\\n\\t\\t\\tprev2 = prev\\n\\t\\t\\tprev = curr\\n\\t\\treturn prev\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires finding the minimum energy used to climb n-1 stairs, where the energy consumed is the absolute difference in heights between consecutive stairs jumped. The constraint is that the climber can jump either one or two steps at a time.\\n- Identifying Potential Strategies: Dynamic Programming seems suitable because the minimum energy at any given stair depends on the minimum energy to reach the previous one or two stairs.  Since only the previous two energy values are needed, we can optimize space complexity by using two variables instead of an array.\\n- Edge Cases and Constraints: Consider the base cases for the first and second stairs. Make sure to handle cases where the number of stairs is less than 3.\\n- Implementation Details: Iterate through the stairs, calculating the energy needed to reach the current stair from the previous one and the stair before that. Update the minimum energy values accordingly.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can dynamic programming be applied to find the minimum energy required to reach each stair?\",\n    \"What are the base cases for this dynamic programming problem, especially for the first and second stairs?\",\n    \"How can the space complexity be optimized from O(n) to O(1) by using a few variables instead of an array?\",\n    \"What would be the formula to calculate the minimum energy required to reach stair 'i' from stair 'i-1' and 'i-2'?\",\n    \"What are the potential edge cases (e.g., n=1, n=2) and how should the code handle them?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Dynamic programming can be used by defining the minimum energy to reach stair 'i' as the minimum of (energy to reach 'i-1' plus energy to jump from 'i-1' to 'i') and (energy to reach 'i-2' plus energy to jump from 'i-2' to 'i').\",\n    \"The base case for n=1 is 0, since the geek starts at the 0th stair. For n=2, the minimum energy is simply the absolute difference between height[1] and height[0].\",\n    \"Instead of storing the minimum energy for each stair in an array, we can store only the minimum energy for the previous two stairs, using two variables (e.g., 'prev' and 'prev2').\",\n    \"The formula is: minEnergy[i] = min(minEnergy[i-1] + abs(height[i] - height[i-1]), minEnergy[i-2] + abs(height[i] - height[i-2])).\",\n    \"Edge cases include n=1, where the answer is 0, and n=2, where the answer is abs(height[1] - height[0]).
