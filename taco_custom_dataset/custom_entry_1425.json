"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"Mike is given a matrix A, N and M are numbers of rows and columns respectively. A1, 1 is the number in the top left corner. All the numbers in A are non-negative integers. He also has L pairs of integers (ik, jk). His task is to calculate Ai1, j1 + Ai2, j2 + ... + AiL, jL.\\n\\nUnfortunately, Mike forgot if Ai, j was a number in the i'th row and j'th column or vice versa, if Ai, j was a number in the j'th row and i'th column.\\n\\nSo, Mike decided to calculate both E1 = Ai1, j1 + Ai2, j2 + ... + AiL, jL and E2 = Aj1, i1 + Aj2, i2 + ... + AjL, iL. If it is impossible to calculate E1(i.e. one of the summands doesn't exist), then let's assume, that it is equal to -1. If it is impossible to calculate E2, then let's also assume, that it is equal to -1.\\n\\nYour task is to calculate max(E1, E2).\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains two integers N and M, denoting the number of rows and the number of columns respectively.\\n\\nEach of next N lines contains M integers. The j'th integer in the (i + 1)'th line of the input denotes Ai, j.\\n\\nThe (N + 2)'th line contains an integer L, denoting the number of pairs of integers, that Mike has.\\n\\nEach of next L lines contains a pair of integers. The (N + 2 + k)-th line in the input contains a pair (ik, jk).\\n\\n-----Output-----\\nThe first line should contain an integer, denoting max(E1, E2).\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput:\\n3 2\\n1 2\\n4 5\\n7 0\\n2\\n1 2\\n2 2\\nOutput:\\n9\\n\\nInput:\\n1 3\\n1 2 3\\n2\\n1 3\\n3 1\\nOutput:\\n-1\\n\\nInput:\\n1 3\\n1 2 3\\n2\\n1 1\\n3 1\\nOutput:\\n4\\n\\n-----Explanation-----\\n\\nIn the first test case N equals to 3, M equals to 2, L equals to 2. E1 = 2 + 5 = 7, E2 = 4 + 5 = 9. The answer is max(E1, E2) = max(7, 9) = 9;\\n\\nIn the second test case N equals to 1, M equals to 3, L equals to 2. It is impossible to calculate E1 and E2, because A3, 1 doesn't exist. So the answer is max(E1, E2) = max(-1, -1) = -1;\\n\\nIn the third test case N equals to 1, M equals to 3, L equals to 2. It is impossible to calculate E1, because A3, 1 doesn't exist. So E1 is equal to -1. E2 = 1 + 3 = 4. The answer is max(E1, E2) = max(-1,4) = 4.\\n\\n-----Scoring-----\\n\\n1 \u2264 ik, jk \u2264 500 for each test case.\\n\\nSubtask 1 (10 points): 1 \u2264 N, M, L \u2264 5, 0 \u2264 Ai, j \u2264 10;\\n\\nSubtask 2 (12 points): 1 \u2264 N, M, L \u2264 300, 0 \u2264 Ai, j \u2264 106, all the numbers in A are equal;\\n\\nSubtask 3 (20 points): 1 \u2264 N, M, L \u2264 300, 0 \u2264 Ai, j \u2264 109;\\n\\nSubtask 4 (26 points): 1 \u2264 N, M, L \u2264 500, 0 \u2264 Ai, j \u2264 109;\\n\\nSubtask 5 (32 points): 1 \u2264 N, M \u2264 500, 1 \u2264 L \u2264 250 000, 0 \u2264 Ai, j \u2264 109.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"(n, m) = map(int, input().split())\\nl = []\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\tl.append(list(map(int, input().split())))\\nans1 = 0\\nans2 = 0\\nk = int(input())\\nc = 0\\nd = 0\\nfor i in range(k):\\n\\t(a, b) = map(int, input().split())\\n\\ttry:\\n\\t\\tans1 += l[a - 1][b - 1]\\n\\texcept:\\n\\t\\tc = 1\\n\\ttry:\\n\\t\\tans2 += l[b - 1][a - 1]\\n\\texcept:\\n\\t\\td = 1\\nif c:\\n\\tans1 = -1\\nif d:\\n\\tans2 = -1\\nprint(max(ans1, ans2))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Read the dimensions of the matrix N and M.\\n- Read the matrix A.\\n- Read the number of pairs L.\\n- Read the pairs (ik, jk).\\n- Calculate E1 = A[i1][j1] + A[i2][j2] + ... + A[iL][jL].
