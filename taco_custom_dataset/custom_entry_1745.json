As archith reached staff room sir gave a smile and asked to complete this assignment in one day if not he will be suspended. Archith has low attendence so he has to complete the assignment in one day.Assignment consists of  checking a parity of numbers and there were huge no of numbers .So he asked your help to sove this problem for him.\\n\\nINPUT :\\nfirst line consists of T test cases.\\nNext T lines consists of decimal numbers N.\\n\\nOUTPUT :\\nIt should print the given number as \\\"even\\\" if the number has even number of 1's in binary form and \\\"odd\\\" if the number has odd number of 1's in binary form.\\n\\n0<T<100\\n\\n0<N<10^9\\n\\nSAMPLE INPUT\\n2\\n12\\n14\\n\\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\\neven \\nodd\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"t=eval(input());\\nwhile t:\\n\\tt-=1;\\n\\tn=eval(input());\\n\\tp=str(bin(n))\\n\\tif p.count('1')%2==0:\\n\\t\\tprint(\\\"even\\\");\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tprint(\\\"odd\\\");\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires determining the parity (even or odd) of the number of 1s in the binary representation of a given decimal number.\\n- Input and Output: The input consists of T test cases, each with a decimal number N. The output should print \\\"even\\\" if the number of 1s in N's binary form is even, and \\\"odd\\\" otherwise.\\n- Constraints: The number of test cases T is between 0 and 100, and each number N is between 0 and 10^9.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: Convert the decimal number to its binary representation. Count the number of 1s in the binary string. Determine if the count is even or odd. Print the appropriate output.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the most efficient way to convert a decimal number to its binary representation in Python?\",\n    \"How can you count the number of occurrences of a specific character in a string in Python?\",\n    \"What is the modulo operator, and how can it be used to determine if a number is even or odd?\",\n    \"How can you handle multiple test cases in a Python program?\",\n    \"Is there a better way to convert integer to binary than using bin() method?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The `bin()` function in Python can be used to convert a decimal number to its binary representation. It returns a string starting with '0b'.\",\n    \"The `count()` method of a string can be used to count the occurrences of a specific character in the string.\",\n    \"The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division. If `n % 2 == 0`, then n is even; otherwise, it is odd.\",\n    \"You can use a loop to iterate through the test cases and process each one individually.\",\n    \"There are other ways, such as bit manipulation or manual implementation. However, using bin() is concise and efficient for most use cases.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
