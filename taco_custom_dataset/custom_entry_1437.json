We are given the time he starts working on the assignments.\\n- Establishing the Core Logic: Determine whether Janmansh can complete all the assignments on time by adding the required time (3 hours) to his starting time and comparing it with the deadline (10 pm).\\n- Formulating the Condition: If the sum of starting time and 3 hours is less than or equal to 10, he can complete the assignments; otherwise, he cannot.\\n- Handling Multiple Test Cases: The code will process multiple test cases, reading a starting time for each and determining if the assignments can be completed on time.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the deadline for Janmansh to submit all three assignments?\",\n    \"How long does it take for Janmansh to complete all three assignments?\",\n    \"How can you determine whether Janmansh can complete the assignments on time based on his starting time?\",\n    \"What condition must be met for Janmansh to successfully complete the assignments before the deadline?\",\n    \"If Janmansh starts at 7 pm, will he finish on time?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The deadline for Janmansh to submit the assignments is 10 pm.\",\n    \"It takes Janmansh 3 hours to complete all three assignments.\",\n    \"By adding 3 hours to Janmansh's starting time and checking if the result is less than or equal to 10.\",\n    \"Janmansh's starting time plus 3 hours must be less than or equal to 10.\",\n    \"Yes, because 7 + 3 = 10, which is on time.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
