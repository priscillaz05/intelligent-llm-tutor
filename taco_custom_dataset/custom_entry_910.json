Every time Tanya climbs a stairway, she starts counting steps from $1$ to the number of steps in this stairway. She speaks every number aloud.

The goal is to determine the number of stairways climbed and the number of steps on each stairway, given the sequence of numbers Tanya pronounced.\\n- Identifying Key Information: The key information is that each stairway starts with the number 1. The sequence of numbers pronounced represents the number of steps in each stairway, in the order they were climbed.\\n- Devising a Solution Strategy: Iterate through the input sequence. Each time the number 1 is encountered, it signifies the start of a new stairway. Keep track of the number of stairways and the number of steps in each. If a number other than 1 is encountered, it represents an additional step in the current stairway.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Consider the case where the input sequence is empty. Also, think of scenarios with single or multiple stairways.\\n- Constructing the Output: The first line of the output is the number of stairways. The second line consists of the number of steps in each stairway, separated by spaces.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you determine when Tanya starts climbing a new stairway based on the input sequence?\",\n    \"How would you store and keep track of the number of steps for each stairway?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases or scenarios that need to be considered while solving the problem?\",\n    \"How do you structure the final output to meet the problem requirements?\",\n    \"If the input is empty, what should the output be?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Tanya starts climbing a new stairway whenever the number 1 is pronounced.\",\n    \"I can use a dictionary or a list to store the number of steps for each stairway. The dictionary (or list index) can represent the stairway number, and the value can be the number of steps.\",\n    \"The edge cases include an empty input sequence, a sequence with only one stairway, or a sequence with multiple stairways. Each of these scenarios should be handled correctly to produce the accurate output.\",\n    \"The output should have two lines. The first line contains the number of stairways, and the second line contains the number of steps for each stairway, separated by spaces.\",\n    \"If the input is empty, the number of stairways is 0, so print 0 and nothing else is needed.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
