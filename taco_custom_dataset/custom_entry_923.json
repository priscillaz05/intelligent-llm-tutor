It involves using kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum by computing difference array and choosing the max out of those difference arrays. Specifically, two difference arrays need to be considered, one when the reversed array starts at an even index and one when it starts at an odd index.\\n- Implementation Details: Implement the Kadane's algorithm to find max subarray sum of the difference array and adding it to the original even position sum.
