Your task is to find the elements whose value is equal to that of its index value ( Consider 1-based indexing ).\\nNote: There can be more than one element in the array which have the same value as its index. You need to include every such element's index. Follows 1-based indexing of the array. \\nExample 1:\\nInput:\\nN = 5\\nArr[] = {15, 2, 45, 12, 7}\\nOutput: 2\\nExplanation: Only Arr[2] = 2 exists here.\\nExample 2:\\nInput: \\nN = 1\\nArr[] = {1}\\nOutput: 1\\nExplanation: Here Arr[1] = 1 exists.\\nYour Task:  \\nYou don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function valueEqualToIndex() which takes the array of integers arr[] and n as parameters and returns an array of indices where the given conditions are satisfied.

Also, note that multiple such elements could exist, and all of them need to be included in the result.\\n- Choosing the Right Data Structures: A list is the obvious data structure to store the results to return.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Iterate through the array and check for each element if it satisfies the given condition. If it does, add it to the resultant array. Ensure that you are using 1-based indexing in the check.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Using `enumerate` is a good way to access both the index and the element without manual indexing.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is 1-based indexing, and how does it affect the code?\",\n    \"How should you handle cases where no element matches its index?\",\n    \"If multiple elements match their indices, what should be the output?\",\n    \"Can you explain the purpose of using `enumerate` in the loop?\",\n    \"What is the expected time complexity, and how does the proposed solution achieve it?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"1-based indexing means the first element is at index 1, not 0. Therefore, when comparing the element's value to its index, you need to add 1 to the array's index.\",\n    \"If no element matches its index, you should return an empty list.\",\n    \"If multiple elements match their indices, you should include all of those elements in the result list.\",\n    \"`enumerate` allows you to iterate over an array while automatically providing both the index and the value of the element, simplifying the code and reducing errors.\",\n    \"The expected time complexity is O(N), which is achieved by iterating through the array once.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
