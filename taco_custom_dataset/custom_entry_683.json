As Allen is planning out all of the different types of cars he will own and how he will arrange them, he realizes that he has a problem. \\n\\nAllen's future parking lot can be represented as a rectangle with 4 rows and n (n \u2264 50) columns of rectangular spaces, each of which can contain at most one car at any time. He imagines having k (k \u2264 2n) cars in the grid, and all the cars are initially in the second and third rows. Each of the cars also has a different designated parking space in the first or fourth row. Allen has to put the cars into corresponding parking places.\\n\\n<image> Illustration to the first example.\\n\\nHowever, since Allen would never entrust his cars to anyone else, only one car can be moved at a time. He can drive a car from a space in any of the four cardinal directions to a neighboring empty space. Furthermore, Allen can only move one of his cars into a space on the first or fourth rows if it is the car's designated parking space. \\n\\nAllen knows he will be a very busy man, and will only have time to move cars at most 20000 times before he realizes that moving cars is not worth his time. Help Allen determine if he should bother parking his cars or leave it to someone less important.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 50, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 2n), representing the number of columns and the number of cars, respectively.\\n\\nThe next four lines will contain n integers each between 0 and k inclusive, representing the initial state of the parking lot. The rows are numbered 1 to 4 from top to bottom and the columns are numbered 1 to n from left to right.\\n\\nIn the first and last line, an integer 1 \u2264 x \u2264 k represents a parking spot assigned to car x (you can only move this car to this place), while the integer 0 represents a empty space (you can't move any car to this place).\\n\\nIn the second and third line, an integer 1 \u2264 x \u2264 k represents initial position of car x, while the integer 0 represents an empty space (you can move any car to this place).\\n\\nEach x between 1 and k appears exactly once in the second and third line, and exactly once in the first and fourth line.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nIf there is a sequence of moves that brings all of the cars to their parking spaces, with at most 20000 car moves, then print m, the number of moves, on the first line. On the following m lines, print the moves (one move per line) in the format i r c, which corresponds to Allen moving car i to the neighboring space at row r and column c.\\n\\nIf it is not possible for Allen to move all the cars to the correct spaces with at most 20000 car moves, print a single line with the integer -1.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nInput\\n\\n4 5\\n1 2 0 4\\n1 2 0 4\\n5 0 0 3\\n0 5 0 3\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n6\\n1 1 1\\n2 1 2\\n4 1 4\\n3 4 4\\n5 3 2\\n5 4 2\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n1 2\\n1\\n2\\n1\\n2\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n-1\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n1 2\\n1\\n1\\n2\\n2\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n2\\n1 1 1\\n2 4 1\\n\\nNote\\n\\nIn the first sample test case, all cars are in front of their spots except car 5, which is in front of the parking spot adjacent. The example shows the shortest possible sequence of moves, but any sequence of length at most 20000 will be accepted.\\n\\nIn the second sample test case, there is only one column, and the cars are in the wrong order, so no cars can move and the task is impossible.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"(n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))\\ntable = []\\nfor row in range(4):\\n\\ttable.append(list(map(int, input().split())))\\nmoves = []\\n\\ndef make_move(start, finish):\\n\\tmoves.append((table[start[0]][start[1]], finish[0] + 1, finish[1] + 1))\\n\\ttable[finish[0]][finish[1]] = table[start[0]][start[1]]\\n\\ttable[start[0]][start[1]] = 0\\n\\ndef move_all_to_places():\\n\\tfor pos in range(n):\\n\\t\\tif table[1][pos] == table[0][pos] and table[1][pos]:\\n\\t\\t\\tmake_move((1, pos), (0, pos))\\n\\t\\tif table[2][pos] == table[3][pos] and table[2][pos]:\\n\\t\\t\\tmake_move((2, pos), (3, pos))\\nmove_all_to_places()\\nfound = False\\nfor pos in range(n):\\n\\tif table[1][pos] == 0:\\n\\t\\tfound = True\\n\\t\\tbreak\\n\\tif table[2][pos] == 0:\\n\\t\\tfound = True\\n\\t\\tbreak\\nif not found:\\n\\tprint(-1)\\n\\texit()\\nfor cnt in range(20000):\\n\\tif table[1][0] != 0 and table[2][0] == 0:\\n\\t\\tmake_move((1, 0), (2, 0))\\n\\t\\tif n == 1:\\n\\t\\t\\tcontinue\\n\\tfor pos in range(1, n):\\n\\t\\tif table[1][pos - 1] == 0 and table[1][pos] != 0:\\n\\t\\t\\tmake_move((1, pos), (1, pos - 1))\\n\\tmove_all_to_places()\\n\\tif table[1][n - 1] == 0 and table[2][n - 1] != 0:\\n\\t\\tmake_move((2, n - 1), (1, n - 1))\\n\\tfor pos in range(n - 2, -1, -1):\\n\\t\\tif table[2][pos + 1] == 0 and table[2][pos] != 0:\\n\\t\\t\\tmake_move((2, pos), (2, pos + 1))\\n\\tmove_all_to_places()\\nif len(moves) > 20000:\\n\\tprint(-1)\\n\\texit()\\nprint(len(moves))\\nfor m in moves:\\n\\tprint(*m)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem describes a parking lot with 4 rows and n columns. There are k cars initially in rows 2 and 3, and they need to be moved to their designated spots in rows 1 and 4. The goal is to find a sequence of moves (at most 20000) to park all cars correctly.\\n- Defining Constraints and Rules: Cars can only move to adjacent empty spaces in four cardinal directions. A car can only move to a space in row 1 or 4 if it's its designated parking spot. Each car has a unique designated parking spot, and each car's initial and final positions are unique.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: Implement a function to make a move and update the parking lot state. A function is used to move cars directly above or below their designated spots. Then repeatedly attempt to shift empty spaces and cars in rows 2 and 3 to enable more direct moves. The solution prioritizes moving cars directly to their target spots when possible.\\n- Implementing the Parking Logic: The solution involves an iterative approach, attempting to shift cars and empty spaces within rows 2 and 3 until as many cars as possible are moved to their destination rows 1 and 4. Each iteration attempts to slide the empty spaces to either the left or right, to make way for movements.\\n- Handling Impossibility Conditions: The solution checks if it is impossible to move all cars to their spots, it prints -1 and exits. The code implicitly handles scenarios where some cars can be moved to their spots but others can't.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you represent the parking lot efficiently in your code, and how will you keep track of the car positions and empty spaces?\",\n    \"How can you move cars to their assigned spots only when permitted, given the constraints of the problem?\",\n    \"What strategy can you use to move the cars around, especially when cars block each other or the empty spaces are not in optimal positions?\",\n    \"How do you make sure that your solution doesn't exceed the move limit of 20000?\",\n    \"How would you identify unsolvable instances, and when should you terminate and output -1?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"I can represent the parking lot using a 2D list (4xN). Each element in the list would be an integer, where 0 represents an empty space and a value between 1 and k represents a car. Car positions are tracked implicitly by the location of these integers.\",\n    \"I will have a function to check if a move is valid. Only move a car to rows 1 or 4 if that cell is designated for that car and only move to adjacent empty spaces.\",\n    \"Iteratively attempt to shift empty spaces to one side or another of rows 2 and 3, to create a clear path for cars to move to their designated rows 1 and 4. Keep trying to make simple moves until the board is solved or the move limit is reached.\",\n    \"Maintain a counter for the number of moves. If the move count exceeds 20000 during processing, stop further processing and output -1.\",\n    \"If there are no empty spaces in row 2 or 3, and not every car is above or below it's destination, or after a certain number of iterations through a moving algorithm, we can not move any car to its desired position then it's unsolvable. Print -1.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
