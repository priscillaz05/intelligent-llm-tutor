Then, he puts on Square s a stone of the same color as the square.\\nKuro and Shiro will play a game using this board and infinitely many black stones and white stones. In this game, Kuro and Shiro alternately put a stone as follows, with Kuro going first:\\n - Choose an empty square adjacent to a square with a stone on it. Let us say Square i is chosen.\\n - Put on Square i a stone of the same color as the square.\\n - If there are squares other than Square i that contain a stone of the same color as the stone just placed, among such squares, let Square j be the one nearest to Square i. Change the color of every stone between Square i and Square j to the color of Square i.\\nThe game ends when the board has no empty square.\\nKuro plays optimally to maximize the number of black stones at the end of the game, while Shiro plays optimally to maximize the number of white stones at the end of the game.\\nFor each of the cases s=1,\\\\dots,n, find the expected value, modulo 998244353, of the number of black stones at the end of the game.\\n\\n-----Notes-----\\nWhen the expected value in question is represented as an irreducible fraction p/q, there uniquely exists an integer r such that rq=p ~(\\\\text{mod } 998244353) and 0 \\\\leq r \\\\lt 998244353, which we ask you to find.\\n\\n-----Constraints-----\\n - 1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 2\\\\times 10^5\\n\\n-----Input-----\\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\\nn\\n\\n-----Output-----\\nPrint n values.\\nThe i-th value should be the expected value, modulo 998244353, of the number of black stones at the end of the game for the case s=i.\\n\\n-----Sample Input-----\\n3\\n\\n-----Sample Output-----\\n499122178\\n499122178\\n499122178\\n\\nLet us use b to represent a black square and w to represent a white square.\\nThere are eight possible boards: www, wwb, wbw, wbb, bww, bwb, bbw, and bbb, which are chosen with equal probability.\\nFor each of these boards, there will be 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 3, 2, and 3 black stones at the end of the game, respectively, regardless of the value of s.\\nThus, the expected number of stones is (0+1+0+2+1+3+2+3)/8 = 3/2, and the answer is r = 499122178, which satisfies 2r = 3 ~(\\\\text{mod } 998244353) and 0 \\\\leq r \\\\lt 998244353.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"N = int(input())\\nmod = 998244353\\ninv4 = 249561088\\nA = [inv4, 0, 3]\\nfor i in range(N):\\n\\tA.append(9 * A[-1] - 24 * A[-2] + 16 * A[-3])\\n\\tA[-1] %= mod\\nA[0] -= inv4\\nB = [0 for i in range(N)]\\nfor i in range(N):\\n\\tx = i\\n\\ty = N - i - 1\\n\\tif x <= y:\\n\\t\\tB[x] = A[i]\\n\\t\\tB[y] = A[i]\\nP = N * pow(2, N - 2 + mod - 1, mod)\\nfor i in range(N):\\n\\tB[i] += P\\n\\tB[i] %= mod\\nQ = pow(2, N - 1, mod)\\nQinv = pow(Q, mod - 2, mod)\\nfor i in range(N):\\n\\tB[i] *= Qinv\\n\\tB[i] %= mod\\nfor i in range(N):\\n\\tprint(B[i])\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem describes a game played on a board of n squares, each colored black or white with equal probability. A stone is placed on square s, and players alternate placing stones on adjacent squares. When a stone is placed, all stones between it and the nearest stone of the same color change color. The goal is to find the expected number of black stones at the end of the game, modulo 998244353, for each possible starting position s.\\n- Identifying Key Components: The core mechanics involve probability, optimal game play (Kuro maximizing black stones and Shiro maximizing white stones), and modular arithmetic.\\n- Simplifications and Edge Cases: Need to consider how the value of s affects the game and the expected outcome. The optimal strategy of Kuro and Shiro is crucial, and needs to consider edge cases where N is small.\\n- Efficient Calculation: The expected value should be calculated modulo 998244353.\\n- Formulating Solution: Precompute some values and store it in an array to be used later in the computation.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does the initial placement of the stone on square 's' influence the game's outcome and the final expected value?\",\n    \"What strategies should Kuro and Shiro employ to maximize their respective stone counts, and how does this affect the overall calculation of the expected value?\",\n    \"Considering the board's probabilistic coloring, how does the probability distribution of black and white squares impact the calculation of the expected number of black stones?\",\n    \"How can we effectively handle modular arithmetic to ensure that the final expected value is calculated correctly modulo 998244353?\",\n    \"Are there any symmetries or patterns in the game that could simplify the calculation of the expected value for different values of 's'?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The initial placement on square 's' determines the starting point from which the board fills up. It may or may not affect the final number of black stones given optimal play and the color-flipping mechanic. Some positions might lead to more control for Kuro or Shiro.\",\n    \"Kuro should try to create contiguous blocks of black stones, especially near the starting stone, to maximize black dominance. Shiro should aim to disrupt these blocks and create white blocks. The optimal strategy depends on the initial board coloring.\",\n    \"Since each square is colored black or white with equal probability, the board has a uniform distribution of colors initially. The initial board configuration affects the optimal game play.\",\n    \"Use modulo arithmetic in every calculation. Apply the modulo operator (%) after every addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Use modular inverse for division.\",\n    \"Yes, there might be symmetries. For example, if n is even, s=i and s=n-i+1 should result in the same expected values. \"\n  ]\n}\n```"
