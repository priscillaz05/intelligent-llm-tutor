If such a node doesn't exist (i.e., the node with the key is the rightmost node at its level), return a node with the value -1.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Consider edge cases such as an empty tree, a tree where the key is not found, or a tree where the key is the last node on its level.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Employ a level-order traversal (Breadth-First Search) to iterate through the tree level by level.  Store the nodes in a level temporarily. This allows easy checking of adjacent nodes.\\n- Implementing Level Order Traversal: Use a queue to manage the nodes to be visited.  After processing a level, add a special 'level end' marker to the data. This aids in identifying the end of a level, crucial for finding the 'next right' node. Scan through the collected level data to find the next element after the key, while handling the level end condition.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean to find the 'next right' node of a given key in a binary tree, and what should you return if there is no such node?\",\n    \"What edge cases should you handle, such as an empty tree, a key not found in the tree, or the key being the rightmost node on its level?\",\n    \"What algorithmic approach might you consider for traversing the tree to efficiently find the next right node?\",\n    \"How can you effectively use a queue to perform a level-order traversal?\",\n    \"How will you identify the boundary between levels to determine whether the next node after the key exists on the same level, or whether you should return a node with the value -1?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Finding the 'next right' node means finding the node immediately to the right of the node with the given key on the same level of the tree.
