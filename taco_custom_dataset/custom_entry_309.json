Thankfully, Masha found somewhere a revolver with a rotating cylinder of n bullet slots able to contain exactly k bullets, now the boys have a chance to resolve the problem once and for all. \\n\\nSasha selects any k out of n slots he wishes and puts bullets there. Roma spins the cylinder so that every of n possible cylinder's shifts is equiprobable. Then the game starts, the players take turns, Sasha starts: he puts the gun to his head and shoots. If there was no bullet in front of the trigger, the cylinder shifts by one position and the weapon is given to Roma for make the same move. The game continues until someone is shot, the survivor is the winner. \\n\\nSasha does not want to lose, so he must choose slots for bullets in such a way as to minimize the probability of its own loss. Of all the possible variant he wants to select the lexicographically minimal one, where an empty slot is lexicographically less than a charged one. \\n\\nMore formally, the cylinder of n bullet slots able to contain k bullets can be represented as a string of n characters. Exactly k of them are \\\"X\\\" (charged slots) and the others are \\\".\\\" (uncharged slots). \\n\\nLet us describe the process of a shot. Suppose that the trigger is in front of the first character of the string (the first slot). If a shot doesn't kill anyone and the cylinder shifts, then the string shifts left. So the first character becomes the last one, the second character becomes the first one, and so on. But the trigger doesn't move. It will be in front of the first character of the resulting string.\\n\\nAmong all the strings that give the minimal probability of loss, Sasha choose the lexicographically minimal one. According to this very string, he charges the gun. You have to help Sasha to charge the gun. For that, each xi query must be answered: is there a bullet in the positions xi?\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line contains three integers n, k and p (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1018, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 p \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of slots in the cylinder, the number of bullets and the number of queries. Then follow p lines; they are the queries. Each line contains one integer xi (1 \u2264 xi \u2264 n) the number of slot to describe.\\n\\nPlease do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit numbers in \u0421++.

The program needs to answer p queries, each asking whether a given slot should contain a bullet or not.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints and Optimizations:  The lexicographical minimization strategy and the even/odd nature of n seem to play a crucial role. We need to place the bullets such that the empty slots come first in the lexicographical order. Also, n being even or odd impacts the number of effective slots to consider.  If n is odd, the last slot is always filled.  If n is even, we distribute as evenly as possible.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy:  The given solution calculates `ak` and `an`. `ak` seems to represent the effective number of bullets to consider and `an` represents the effective number of slots to consider for even distribution. Then for each query position `v`, it calculates an index `idx` and compares it to `ak` to determine if a bullet should be placed or not. The even/odd position of the slot `v` also seems to affect the bullet placement. Let's break down the calculation of `idx`.  The intuition behind this is to distribute the bullets as evenly as possible across the even slots. If `n` is even, there will be bullets only in even positions.  If `n` is odd, the last position is always a bullet. So we are looking if a given `v` contains a bullet or not. It has to do with distributing the `k` bullets among the `n` slots.\\n- Edge Case Handling: Need to handle the edge cases when k is zero or when the query is on the last slot and n is odd. When k is zero, all the positions are empty. When v = n and k != 0, then last slot is always a bullet (when n is odd).\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Could you explain the significance of n being even or odd and how that affects the placement of bullets?\",\n    \"How is the `idx` calculated, and what does it represent in relation to the optimal bullet placement?\",\n    \"What is the significance of finding the lexicographically minimal string, and how does the algorithm achieve that?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases that need to be handled, and what would be the expected behavior in each of those cases?\",\n    \"Can you describe the intuition behind why we are considering only even slots in the general approach?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"If n is odd, the last slot is always filled with a bullet. If n is even, the bullets are distributed as evenly as possible, prioritizing filling the even-numbered slots before moving to odd-numbered slots.\",\n    \"`idx` is a calculated index that determines if a bullet should be placed at slot `v`. It is based on the position of `v` and whether it's even or odd. The calculation attempts to distribute the bullets evenly across the available slots and determine if the current slot falls within the range of bullets.\",\n    \"The problem requires us to choose the lexicographically smallest configuration that minimizes Sasha's probability of getting shot. The algorithm achieves this by prioritizing placing bullets in the later slots, thus making the earlier slots empty whenever possible. If `n` is even it means it needs to minimize having bullets earlier on in the string\",\n    \"The main edge cases are when k is 0 (all slots are empty), or when v is the last slot (which should be filled if n is odd). If k is 0 every slot should be empty. If v == n, then it depends if n is odd or even. If n is odd, the last slot is filled. If n is even then it depends on calculating the `idx` and comparing against `ak`.\",\n    \"We are considering only the even slots because the optimal arrangement aims to have empty slots in earlier positions, resulting in the lexicographically smallest solution.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
