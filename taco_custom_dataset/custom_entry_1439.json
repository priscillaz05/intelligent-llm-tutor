This means the greatest common divisor (GCD) of each adjacent pair must be 1.\\n- Identifying Core Logic: The core logic involves iterating through the array and checking the GCD of each adjacent pair. If the GCD is not 1, it indicates that the pair is not co-prime, and an insertion is needed.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Iterate through the array and calculate the GCD of each adjacent pair. Keep a running count of the number of insertions required.\\n- Implementation Considerations: The GCD calculation should be efficient. The loop should correctly access adjacent elements.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for two numbers to be co-prime, and how do you determine if two numbers are co-prime?\",\n    \"How would you calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers efficiently in Python?\",\n    \"How do you iterate through the array to check all adjacent pairs and determine if they are co-prime?\",\n    \"How do you keep track of the number of insertions needed to make all adjacent pairs co-prime?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases to consider, such as an empty array or an array with only one element?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Two numbers are co-prime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1.
