Since we love Reza Shiri and his songs, we never download them for free. Reza Shiri\u2019s songs must be purchased from authorised stores. However, what if there is not enough money to buy all the songs?\\n\\nThere are $N$ songs (numbered $1$ through $N$) and $M$ albums (numbered $1$ through $M$) available. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th song has *greatness* $v_{i}$, price $p_{i}$ and belongs to the album $a_{i}$. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th album has price $b_{i}$. If we buy an album, then all songs from this album count as bought. It is also possible to buy any songs individually.\\n\\nYour task is simple \u2015 given the budget $P$ (the amount of money we have), calculate the maximum total greatness of songs we can buy.

We can buy songs individually or as part of albums. Buying an album gives us all the songs in that album.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints and Variables: We have N songs, M albums, and a budget P. Each song has a price p_i and greatness v_i, and belongs to album a_i. Each album has a price b_i.\\n- Devising an Algorithmic Approach: We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. The core idea is to build a DP table where dp[i][j] represents the maximum greatness we can achieve considering the first i songs and spending at most j money.\\n- Handling Albums: When processing each album, we have two options: either buy the album or not. If we buy the album, we get all the songs in it, contributing to the total greatness. If not, we consider each song in the album individually.\\n- Defining the DP Transitions: The transition involves checking for each song/album whether buying it is optimal given the current budget and updating the DP table accordingly.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you represent the 'greatness' and 'price' information for each song and album in your code?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: I would use lists or dictionaries to store the greatness and price values for each song and album. For example, I could use a list of tuples to store the (price, greatness) for each song, and a dictionary to map album IDs to their prices and the list of songs they contain.\",\n    \"What is the significance of N, M, and P, and how will they affect your algorithm's time complexity?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: N represents the number of songs, M represents the number of albums, and P represents the budget. These variables directly impact the time complexity, as the DP table's size depends on N and P. The algorithm's time complexity will likely be O(N*P) or O(M*P), depending on how albums are handled.\",\n    \"How would you handle the case where buying an album is more cost-effective than buying individual songs in that album?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: During the dynamic programming process, I would consider both options: buying individual songs and buying the album. I would choose the option that yields the maximum greatness for the given budget.\",\n    \"How do you avoid double-counting greatness if a song is part of an album and also bought individually?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: I'll keep track of the songs already bought as part of an album (e.g., using a set). Before adding the greatness of an individually bought song, I'll check if it's already in the set. If so, I'll skip it to avoid double-counting.\",\n    \"If the problem constraints were significantly larger (e.g., N, M, P up to 10^5 or 10^6), how would this impact your approach, and what optimizations might be necessary?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: With larger constraints, the O(N*P) approach might become too slow. I might need to explore other algorithmic techniques, such as greedy approaches or approximation algorithms, depending on the specific characteristics of the input data. Additionally, I might need to optimize memory usage to handle the larger data sizes.\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"I would use lists or dictionaries to store the greatness and price values for each song and album.
