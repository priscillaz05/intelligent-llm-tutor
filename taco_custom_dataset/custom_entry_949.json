After a big meal, they took a small break then started playing games.\\n\\nKuro challenged Katie to create a game with only a white paper, a pencil, a pair of scissors and a lot of arrows (you can assume that the number of arrows is infinite). Immediately, Katie came up with the game called Topological Parity.\\n\\nThe paper is divided into $n$ pieces enumerated from $1$ to $n$. Shiro has painted some pieces with some color. Specifically, the $i$-th piece has color $c_{i}$ where $c_{i} = 0$ defines black color, $c_{i} = 1$ defines white color and $c_{i} = -1$ means that the piece hasn't been colored yet.\\n\\nThe rules of the game is simple. Players must put some arrows between some pairs of different pieces in such a way that for each arrow, the number in the piece it starts from is less than the number of the piece it ends at. Also, two different pieces can only be connected by at most one arrow. After that the players must choose the color ($0$ or $1$) for each of the unpainted pieces. The score of a valid way of putting the arrows and coloring pieces is defined as the number of paths of pieces of alternating colors. For example, $[1 \\\\to 0 \\\\to 1 \\\\to 0]$, $[0 \\\\to 1 \\\\to 0 \\\\to 1]$, $[1]$, $[0]$ are valid paths and will be counted. You can only travel from piece $x$ to piece $y$ if and only if there is an arrow from $x$ to $y$.\\n\\nBut Kuro is not fun yet. He loves parity. Let's call his favorite parity $p$ where $p = 0$ stands for \\\"even\\\" and $p = 1$ stands for \\\"odd\\\". He wants to put the arrows and choose colors in such a way that the score has the parity of $p$.\\n\\nIt seems like there will be so many ways which satisfy Kuro. He wants to count the number of them but this could be a very large number. Let's help him with his problem, but print it modulo $10^{9} + 7$.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $p$ ($1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 50$, $0 \\\\leq p \\\\leq 1$) \u2014 the number of pieces and Kuro's wanted parity.\\n\\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $c_{1}, c_{2}, ..., c_{n}$ ($-1 \\\\leq c_{i} \\\\leq 1$) \u2014 the colors of the pieces.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the number of ways to put the arrows and choose colors so the number of valid paths of alternating colors has the parity of $p$.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n3 1\\n-1 0 1\\n\\nOutput\\n6\\nInput\\n2 1\\n1 0\\n\\nOutput\\n1\\nInput\\n1 1\\n-1\\n\\nOutput\\n2\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first example, there are $6$ ways to color the pieces and add the arrows, as are shown in the figure below.

The arrows must go from smaller numbered pieces to larger numbered pieces. The score is the number of alternating color paths.\\n- Identifying Constraints:  The number of pieces $n$ is at most 50.  The color of a piece is either 0 (black), 1 (white), or -1 (uncolored). The parity $p$ is either 0 (even) or 1 (odd). The answer needs to be modulo $10^9 + 7$.\\n- Defining the Solution Space:  For each uncolored piece, we have two choices: color it 0 or 1.  For any two pieces $i$ and $j$ where $i < j$, we can either put an arrow from $i$ to $j$ or not.  Since there are at most $50$ pieces, the number of possible colorings and arrow placements can be very large. A dynamic programming approach is likely needed.\\n- Devising a Dynamic Programming Strategy: The core idea is to construct a DP table where dp[i][j][ob][ow] stores the number of ways to color the first i pieces and put arrows such that the parity of alternating paths is j (0 or 1), ob indicates if there is an occurrence of black color, and ow indicates if there is an occurrence of white color.\\n- Base Cases and Transitions: Initialize dp[0][0][0][0] = 1, as there is one way to have no pieces with score 0 and no black or white color. Then iterate through each piece. If the piece has a defined color, the calculations are more straightforward. If a piece does not have a defined color, we consider both possibilities (color 0 or 1). The transitions will consider whether a black or white color is previously present and the number of ways arrows can be constructed, using powers of 2.\\n- Handling the Modulo: The modulo operation must be performed after each calculation to prevent integer overflow.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean by topological parity, and what are we counting in this problem?\",\n    \"How can we handle uncolored pieces to make a correct count?\",\n    \"Since $n$ can be up to 50, what algorithmic approach is feasible?\",\n    \"How can the rule about arrows only pointing from smaller index to larger index be used?\",\n    \"How do you handle a scenario where the calculated count becomes very large during the recursion?\",\n    \"What are the base conditions for the DP and how the transition can be formulated?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Topological parity refers to the parity (even or odd) of the number of alternating color paths in the graph constructed by the pieces and arrows. We are counting the number of configurations of coloring the uncolored pieces and adding arrows such that the total number of alternating color paths has the desired parity.\",\n    \"For each uncolored piece, we have two choices: color it black (0) or white (1). We need to consider both possibilities and update the count accordingly. We will add the counts computed for each possibility.\",\n    \"Given $n <= 50$, it is likely that an exponential or factorial solution is too slow. Dynamic programming approach is probably the most feasible way to solve this problem. We would build up solutions from the first piece, considering each piece up to $n$.\",\n    \"This rule helps in structuring our solution because it implies a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where edges (arrows) only go from smaller indices to larger indices.  We can process the pieces in increasing order of their indices, and the number of possible arrow placements between previous pieces is a power of 2 (either an arrow is present or not between each pair).\",\n    \"We need to perform the modulo operation ($10^9 + 7$) after each arithmetic operation (addition, multiplication) to prevent integer overflow and keep the count within the acceptable range.\",\n    \"The base case is dp[0][0][0][0] = 1 which signifies there is 1 way (doing nothing) to arrive at 0 pieces. Then, the transition from state i-1 to state i will depend on whether color nums[i] is defined or undefined and will depend on previous colors and whether path parities are consistent given arrow placement. We also need to keep track whether a black color and white color are present.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
