For example second player of chosen group next to first player of chosen group, third player next to second and similarly last player next to second last player of chosen group. Basically You've to choose a contiguous group of players.\\nAfter choosing a group, players can be paired if they have the same T-Shirt number (one player can be present in at most one pair), finally the chosen group is called \u201cgood\u201d if at most one player is left unmatched. Your task is to find the size of the maximum \u201cgood\u201d group.\\nFormally, you are given a string $S=s_{1}s_{2}s_{3}...s_{i}...s_{n}$ where $s_{i}$ can be any digit character between $'0'$ and $'9'$ and $s_{i}$ denotes the number written on the T-Shirt of $i^{th}$ player. Find a value $length$ such that there exist pair of indices $(i,j)$ which denotes $S[i...j]$ is a \u201cgood\u201d group where $i\\\\geq1$ and $j\\\\leq S.length$ and $i\\\\leq j$ and $(j-i+1)=length$ and there exist no other pair $(i\u2019,j\u2019)$ such that $(j\u2019-i\u2019+1)>length$ and $S[i'...j']$ is a \\\"good\\\" group.\\n\\n-----Input:-----\\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases.

The length of the string can be up to 10^5, so a naive approach of checking all possible substrings individually might be too slow.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: A dynamic programming approach can be used. A 2D array can store the counts of each digit in each substring. Iterate through all possible start and end indices of the substrings. For each substring, calculate the count of each digit and check if at most one digit has an odd count.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Implement the algorithm to efficiently compute the digit counts for each substring and determine if a substring is 'good' based on the counts. Track and update the maximum length of a 'good' substring found so far.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you define a 'good' group of players, and what are the constraints on the number of unmatched players?\",\n    \"How do you handle the constraint that the players must be in consecutive order?\",\n    \"What is the most efficient approach to identify and check all possible groups?\",\n    \"How do you maintain and update the counts of digits to determine if a substring is 'good'?\",\n    \"How do you handle the edge cases, such as when the input string is empty?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A 'good' group is a contiguous sequence of players in which at most one digit appears an odd number of times, meaning at most one player is left unmatched.\",\n    \"The consecutive order means we only consider substrings of the input string where the indices are contiguous. For example, if the string is '12345', valid groups are '1', '12', '123', '23', '234', '345', and so on.\",\n    \"The most efficient approach is to iterate through all possible start and end indices of the substrings, potentially using dynamic programming to avoid recomputing digit counts for overlapping substrings. An alternative approach may use prefix computations.\",\n    \"One way is to use a 2D array or a dictionary to store the counts of each digit for each substring. This can be computed efficiently by adding/subtracting digit counts as the substring's endpoints are moved. Another way would be using a prefix approach and computing counts based on differences between end and start prefixes.\",\n    \"If the input string is empty, the maximum length of a good group is 0.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
