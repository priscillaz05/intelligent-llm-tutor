"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"We've got a message from the **Librarian**. As usual there're many `o` and `k` in it and, as all codewarriors don't know \\\"Ook\\\" language we need that you translate this message.\\n\\n**tip** : it seems traditional \\\"Hello World!\\\" would look like :\\n`Ok, Ook, Ooo?  Okk, Ook, Ok?  Okk, Okk, Oo?  Okk, Okk, Oo?  Okk, Okkkk?  Ok, Ooooo?  Ok, Ok, Okkk?  Okk, Okkkk?  Okkk, Ook, O?  Okk, Okk, Oo?  Okk, Ook, Oo?  Ook, Ooook!`\\n\\nYour task is to implement a function `okkOokOo(okkOookk)`, that would take the `okkOookk` message as input and return a decoded human-readable string.\\n\\n*eg*:\\n```python\\nokkOokOo('Ok, Ook, Ooo!')  # -> 'H'\\nokkOokOo('Ok, Ook, Ooo?  Okk, Ook, Ok?  Okk, Okk, Oo?  Okk, Okk, Oo?  Okk, Okkkk!')  # -> 'Hello'\\nokkOokOo('Ok, Ok, Okkk?  Okk, Okkkk?  Okkk, Ook, O?  Okk, Okk, Oo?  Okk, Ook, Oo?

Map these to binary and convert to ASCII.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: First split the input string by '?'.  Then convert each word to its binary representation using the provided mapping. Convert the binary to an integer, and convert the integer to its ASCII character. Join the characters together for the final output.\\n-Edge Cases/Constraints: 'O', 'o', 'k' are case-insensitive.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you convert 'o' and 'k' to binary to be further processed?\",\n    \"How to split the string to get the 'encoded' words?\",\n    \"How to transform the message to its decoded version?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"You need to map 'O' or 'o' to '0' and 'k' to '1'. A dictionary would be a helpful tool for this.\",\n    \"Use the 'split' function with '?' as the delimiter.\",\n    \"Iterate through the message's 'words', transforming each one.
