Order matters, so \\\"AB\\\" and \\\"BA\\\" are considered different sequences.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints: The length of tiles is limited to 7. The tiles consist of uppercase English letters.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Dynamic programming or backtracking can be used. Since the length is small, backtracking with pruning can be more straightforward. We need to avoid duplicate permutations, which can be handled by counting character frequencies.\\n- Implementation Details: Maintain a count of each tile. The backtracking function generates sequences, ensuring to only use available tiles. The result is incremented for each valid sequence generated.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can we avoid generating duplicate sequences if the same character appears multiple times in tiles?\",\n    \"What's the base case for the recursive/backtracking function?\",\n    \"How can you optimize the backtracking process to reduce redundant computations?\",\n    \"What data structure can efficiently track the counts of different tiles?\",\n    \"How do you handle the constraint that the result should not include the empty sequence?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"By using a frequency count of each character. Before processing a character in the backtracking step, decrement its count, process the sequence, and then increment it back when backtracking. This avoids generating duplicate sequences.\",\n    \"The base case is when all the tiles have been used, but since we're generating non-empty sequences, we stop as soon as a sequence has been created, and increment the global count.\",\n    \"Use a frequency count to avoid redundant calculations by considering only the unique characters. Memoization is not applicable since the sequence matters, and therefore, the order of character selection changes the problem instance.\",\n    \"A dictionary or a Counter object (from the collections module) can be used to efficiently track the count of each tile.\",\n    \"The problem asks to return the number of non-empty sequences. We can count all possible sequences, including the empty one, and subtract 1 from the final count to exclude the empty sequence.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
