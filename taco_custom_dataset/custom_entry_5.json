In just intonation, which is one of the scales used for tuning musical instruments, the ratio of the frequencies of the sounds is a sequence of humming numbers of 24, 27, 30, 32, 36, 40, 45, 48.\\n\\nCreate a program that takes integers m and n as inputs and outputs the number of humming numbers that are m or more and n or less.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nA sequence of multiple datasets is given as input.

The problem asks to count the Hamming numbers within a given range [m, n].\\n- Generating Hamming Numbers: Create a method to generate all possible Hamming numbers up to a certain limit. Since m and n are up to 1,000,000, generate all Hamming numbers <= 1,000,000.\\n- Optimizing Generation: Use nested loops to generate all combinations of powers of 2, 3, and 5. Use a set to avoid duplicates and improve efficiency. Convert the set to a list and sort the list.\\n- Counting Hamming Numbers within Range: Use binary search to find the index of the first Hamming number >= m and the index of the first Hamming number > n.  The difference between these indices will give the count of Hamming numbers within the range [m, n].\\n- Handling Input: Read the input pairs (m, n) until a line with a single zero is encountered.

To avoid generating numbers larger than the limit, we can calculate the maximum powers of 2, 3, and 5 such that 2^i * 3^j * 5^k <= limit.\",\n    \"A set is ideal for storing generated Hamming numbers because it automatically handles duplicates and offers efficient lookup.\",\n    \"Binary search can find the index of the first Hamming number >= m (using bisect_left) and the index of the first Hamming number > n (using bisect_right). The difference between these indices gives the number of Hamming numbers within [m, n].\",\n    \"The program should use a while loop that continues to read input until a ValueError occurs, indicating the end of input (a single line of zero).\",\n    \"One way to optimize the number of iterations is to pre-calculate the maximum powers of 2, 3, and 5 such that their product does not exceed the upper limit of the range (1,000,000 in this case).
