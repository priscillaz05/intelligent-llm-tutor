Bran like candies so much, so Arya is going to give him some Candies.\\n\\nAt first, Arya and Bran have 0 Candies. There are n days, at the i-th day, Arya finds a_{i} candies in a box, that is given by the Many-Faced God. Every day she can give Bran at most 8 of her candies. If she don't give him the candies at the same day, they are saved for her and she can give them to him later.\\n\\nYour task is to find the minimum number of days Arya needs to give Bran k candies before the end of the n-th day. Formally, you need to output the minimum day index to the end of which k candies will be given out (the days are indexed from 1 to n).\\n\\nPrint -1 if she can't give him k candies during n given days.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10000).\\n\\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 100).\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nIf it is impossible for Arya to give Bran k candies within n days, print -1.\\n\\nOtherwise print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of days Arya needs to give Bran k candies before the end of the n-th day.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n2 3\\n1 2\\n\\nOutput\\n2\\nInput\\n3 17\\n10 10 10\\n\\nOutput\\n3\\nInput\\n1 9\\n10\\n\\nOutput\\n-1\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first sample, Arya can give Bran 3 candies in 2 days.\\n\\nIn the second sample, Arya can give Bran 17 candies in 3 days, because she can give him at most 8 candies per day.\\n\\nIn the third sample, Arya can't give Bran 9 candies, because she can give him at most 8 candies per day and she must give him the candies within 1 day.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"(n, m) = map(int, input().split())\\nc = list(map(int, input().split()))\\ni = 0\\nl = 0\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\tl += c[i]\\n\\tm -= min(l, 8)\\n\\tl -= min(l, 8)\\n\\tif m <= 0:\\n\\t\\tprint(i + 1)\\n\\t\\tbreak\\nelse:\\n\\tprint(-1)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: Realize that Arya has candies each day and can give at most 8 candies to Bran each day. Any remaining candies from previous days are saved. The goal is to find the minimum number of days to give Bran k candies.\\n- Initial Algorithm Strategy: Iterate through the days, accumulating candies. On each day, give Bran the minimum of the accumulated candies and 8. Subtract the candies given from k. If k becomes 0 or negative, the number of days has been found. If after n days, k is still positive, it's impossible.\\n- Special Edge Cases and Constraints: Ensure the code handles the case where it is not possible to give away k candies within n days. Print -1 in such cases.\\n- Optimization and Edge Handling: Take into account that the candies can accumulate, and on any day, the sister gives either all the accumulated candies if they are less than 8 or 8 if they are greater. Accumulate candies each day and then give a maximum of 8 candies to Bran.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you approach this problem, focusing on how candies accumulate and how the maximum candies given each day affect the solution?\",\n    \"What are the key variables you would use, and how would they track the state of the problem (candies available, candies needed, days passed)?\",\n    \"How would you handle the constraint that Arya can only give a maximum of 8 candies each day?\",\n    \"What conditions would lead to the output being -1, indicating it's impossible to give Bran k candies?\",\n    \"How would you structure your code to iterate through each day, update the number of candies Arya has, give candies to Bran (up to 8), and check if Bran has received enough candies?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Iterate through each day, accumulating the candies found. Each day, give Bran up to 8 candies, using the minimum of accumulated candies and 8. Reduce k by the number of candies given each day.\",\n    \"Variables: n (number of days), k (candies Bran needs), candies_available (accumulated candies), days_passed (number of days iterated).\",\n    \"Each day, determine the amount given to Bran as min(candies_available, 8).\",\n    \"If, after iterating through all n days, k is still greater than 0, output -1.\",\n    \"A for loop iterating through n days. Inside the loop, update candies_available by adding the candies found that day. Calculate candies_given as min(candies_available, 8), subtract candies_given from k, subtract candies_given from candies_available. Check if k <= 0, and if so, print the current day and exit the loop. If the loop completes without k <= 0, print -1.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
