"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"Mishka started participating in a programming contest. There are $n$ problems in the contest. Mishka's problem-solving skill is equal to $k$.\\n\\nMishka arranges all problems from the contest into a list. Because of his weird principles, Mishka only solves problems from one of the ends of the list. Every time, he chooses which end (left or right) he will solve the next problem from. Thus, each problem Mishka solves is either the leftmost or the rightmost problem in the list.\\n\\nMishka cannot solve a problem with difficulty greater than $k$. When Mishka solves the problem, it disappears from the list, so the length of the list decreases by $1$. Mishka stops when he is unable to solve any problem from any end of the list.\\n\\nHow many problems can Mishka solve?\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line of input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\\\le n, k \\\\le 100$) \u2014 the number of problems in the contest and Mishka's problem-solving skill.\\n\\nThe second line of input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\\\le a_i \\\\le 100$), where $a_i$ is the difficulty of the $i$-th problem. The problems are given in order from the leftmost to the rightmost in the list.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nPrint one integer \u2014 the maximum number of problems Mishka can solve.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n8 4\\n4 2 3 1 5 1 6 4\\n\\nOutput\\n5\\n\\nInput\\n5 2\\n3 1 2 1 3\\n\\nOutput\\n0\\n\\nInput\\n5 100\\n12 34 55 43 21\\n\\nOutput\\n5\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first example, Mishka can solve problems in the following order: $[4, 2, 3, 1, 5, 1, 6, 4] \\\\rightarrow [2, 3, 1, 5, 1, 6, 4] \\\\rightarrow [2, 3, 1, 5, 1, 6] \\\\rightarrow [3, 1, 5, 1, 6] \\\\rightarrow [1, 5, 1, 6] \\\\rightarrow [5, 1, 6]$, so the number of solved problems will be equal to $5$.\\n\\nIn the second example, Mishka can't solve any problem because the difficulties of problems from both ends are greater than $k$.\\n\\nIn the third example, Mishka's solving skill is so amazing that he can solve all the problems.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"(n, k) = map(int, input().split())\\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\\nans = 0\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\tif A[i] > k:\\n\\t\\tbreak\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tans += 1\\nif i != n - 1:\\n\\tfor j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\\n\\t\\tif A[j] > k:\\n\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tans += 1\\nprint(ans)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: Recognize that Mishka solves problems from either end of a list as long as his skill level $k$ is greater than or equal to the problem's difficulty.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints: Understand that the list shrinks after each solved problem, and Mishka stops when he cannot solve any problems from either end.\\n- Devising a Two-Pointer Approach: Use two pointers (left and right) to iterate from both ends of the list. Count how many problems Mishka can solve from each end until he encounters a problem he cannot solve.\\n- Accounting for Overlap: Consider the case where Mishka might solve all problems from both ends, and handle cases to avoid double-counting if the pointers meet in the middle.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What conditions determine whether Mishka can solve a problem from either end of the list?\",\n    \"How does solving a problem affect the list and the solving process?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently track the number of problems Mishka solves from both ends?\",\n    \"What edge cases should be considered to ensure correct problem-solving counts?\",\n    \"If all problems can be solved, how do you avoid double-counting problems solved from both ends?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Mishka can solve a problem if his solving skill $k$ is greater than or equal to the difficulty of the problem.\",\n    \"Solving a problem removes it from the list, shortening the list by one. This potentially reveals new problems at the ends.\",\n    \"Use two pointers starting from both ends, moving inwards and incrementing a counter each time a problem is solved.\",\n    \"Consider cases where Mishka cannot solve any problems from either end initially, or when all problems can be solved.\",\n    \"If all problems can be solved, the final counter value should be the total number of problems.  Special care is needed if the two pointers 'meet', to avoid overcounting a single problem.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
