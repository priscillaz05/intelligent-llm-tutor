Crucially, the result needs to be modulo 998244353.\\n- Identifying Key Computational Challenges: The core challenge is efficiently computing f(T) for every possible subset T, without explicitly iterating through all subsets.  This suggests a need for a more clever, counting-based approach.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy Selection: Realize that the brute-force approach to enumerate all subsets is O(2^N * N), which will timeout given N <= 2*10^5. The provided solution code includes a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) and coordinate compression which is crucial for efficient calculation. The code iterates twice, once sorting by y and another time after reversing the sorted order, and applies the BIT to find the number of x coordinates less than a particular value.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Coordinate compression will map the distinct x-coordinates to a smaller range to efficiently use the BIT. The `update` and `getvalue` functions for the BIT are important for efficient calculation of the number of points to the left during the iteration. The initial value of ANS needs to be calculated correctly as well.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does the function f(T) represent and how is it calculated?\",\n    \"What is the naive approach to solve this problem and why it may not be efficient?\",\n    \"The provided solution uses coordinate compression.

This is O(2^N * N) which is not efficient for large N because there are 2^N subsets of N elements.\",\n    \"Coordinate compression maps the original x-coordinates to a smaller, consecutive range of integers. This improves efficiency by reducing the memory footprint and allows the use of BIT data structures on smaller index ranges.\",\n    \"A Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) is a data structure used for efficiently calculating prefix sums in an array. In this solution, it's used to count the number of points with x-coordinates less than or equal to a given value within a certain y-coordinate range.\",\n    \"Sorting the points by y-coordinate helps to iterate through the points from bottom to top (and vice versa after reversing).

It is used to keep the results within a manageable range and prevent integer overflow, since the sum of f(T) can be very large. The problem requires the output modulo 998244353.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
