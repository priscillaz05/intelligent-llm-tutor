Please determine if S is Chef's favourite.\\n\\nNote: A substring is a continuous part of string which can be obtained by deleting some (may be none) character's from the beginning and some (may be none) character's from the end.\\n\\n------ Input Format ------ \\n\\n- The first line of the input contains an integer T - the number of test cases.

Be aware that there might be multiple occurrences of both substrings.\\n- Devising a Strategy: Determine a method to find the first occurrence of 'chef'. Then, check if 'code' appears before that first 'chef'. The problem statement only requires checking if *every* chef has a code before it, so we can stop after finding the first chef without a code before it.\\n- Implementation Details: Use the `find` method in Python to locate the substrings. Consider using the optional start and end parameters in `find` to constrain the search efficiently.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the substrings we need to search for, and what does it mean for the string to be Chef's favorite?\",\n    \"What happens if 'chef' appears before 'code' in the string? What should the output be in that case?\",\n    \"How can you optimize the search for the substrings 'code' and 'chef' using the `find` method, and what parameters might be useful?\",\n    \"Is it necessary to check all occurrences of 'chef'? Why or why not?\",\n    \"What are the possible return values of the `find` method and what do they indicate in the context of this problem?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"We need to search for the substrings 'code' and 'chef'. A string is Chef's favorite if every instance of 'chef' has an instance of 'code' appearing before it.\",\n    \"If 'chef' appears before 'code', the output should be 'WA' since that means there is at least one instance of 'chef' that doesn't have 'code' before it.\",\n    \"We can use the `find` method with the start and end parameters to constrain the search space. Specifically, we can search for 'chef' first. If found at index k, we can then search for 'code' from index 0 to k. This will check if 'code' appears before 'chef'.\",\n    \"No, it is not necessary to check all occurrences of 'chef'. If we find even one 'chef' that doesn't have 'code' before it, then we can immediately output 'WA' because not *every* chef has a code before it.\",\n    \"The `find` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring if found, or -1 if not found. So if find('code') returns a value >= 0 and less than index of first chef, then output should be AC\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
