This limits the length of foodchain which is defined to be the highest level receiving non-zero energy.\\n\\nE is the energy at the lowest tropic level. Given E and K for an ecosystem, find the maximum length of foodchain.\\n\\nNote: \\\\lfloor x \\\\rfloor denoted the floor function, and it returns the greatest integer that is less than or equal to x (i.e  rounds down to the nearest integer). For example, \\\\lfloor 1.4 \\\\rfloor = 1, \\\\lfloor 5 \\\\rfloor = 5, \\\\lfloor -1.5 \\\\rfloor = -2, \\\\lfloor -3 \\\\rfloor = -3 , \\\\lfloor 0 \\\\rfloor = 0.\\n\\n------ Input Format ------ \\n\\n- First line will contain T, number of testcases.

For the second level energy becomes \\\\lfloor \\\\frac{5} {3} \\\\rfloor = 1 units. So the length of foodchain is $2$ since from the next level onwards $0$ units of energy will be received.\\n\\nTestCase $3$: The energy at different levels is:\\n- Level $1$- $10$ units\\n- Level $2$- \\\\lfloor \\\\frac{10} {2} \\\\rfloor = 5$ units\\n- Level $3$- \\\\lfloor \\\\frac{5} {2} \\\\rfloor = 2$ units\\n- Level $4$- \\\\lfloor \\\\frac{2} {2} \\\\rfloor = 1$ units\\n- Level $5$- \\\\lfloor \\\\frac{1} {2} \\\\rfloor = 0$ units\\n\\nSo the answer is $4$, since it is the last level to receive non-zero energy.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"for z in range(int(input())):\\n\\t(a, b) = map(int, input().split())\\n\\tc = 1\\n\\tx = 0\\n\\twhile a // b > 0:\\n\\t\\ta = a // b\\n\\t\\tc += 1\\n\\tprint(c)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem asks to determine the length of a food chain given an initial energy E and a reduction factor K. The length of the food chain is the number of trophic levels with non-zero energy, where each level's energy is the floor of the previous level's energy divided by K.\\n- Identifying Core Logic: The core logic involves repeatedly dividing the current energy by K and taking the floor until the energy becomes zero. The number of divisions performed is the length of the food chain.\\n- Edge Cases and Constraints:  E and K are integers within a specific range. We must deal with the floor function correctly. Consider the condition when E becomes zero or less than K, at which point the chain ends.\\n- Algorithm Selection: A simple iterative approach will suffice, as the problem requires repeating a division operation and counting how many times the energy is non-zero after each division.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does the energy at each trophic level relate to the energy at the previous level, and what function is used to calculate it?\",\n    \"What condition should be checked in the loop to determine when to stop calculating energy levels?\",\n    \"How do the constraints on E and K affect the choice of data types and the potential for integer overflow?\",\n    \"What happens when the initial energy E is less than K?\",\n    \"Can you explain the purpose of the floor function \\\\lfloor x \\\\rfloor and how it impacts the calculations in this problem?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The energy at each level is the floor of the energy at the previous level divided by K, represented as \\\\lfloor \\\\frac{Energy_{previous}}{K} \\\\rfloor.\",\n    \"The loop should stop when the floor of the energy at the current level divided by K is equal to zero.\",\n    \"Since E and K can be as large as 10^9, using integers is safe as the divisions will always result in smaller numbers. No overflow issues will occur. Data type int is sufficient.\",\n    \"If the initial energy E is less than K, then the next energy level will be \\\\lfloor \\\\frac{E}{K} \\\\rfloor = 0, hence the length of the food chain will be 1.\",\n    \"The floor function \\\\lfloor x \\\\rfloor returns the largest integer less than or equal to x. It effectively truncates the decimal part of the division, ensuring that the energy at the next level is always an integer. It is essential as the problem states that energy transfer is calculated using the floor function.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
