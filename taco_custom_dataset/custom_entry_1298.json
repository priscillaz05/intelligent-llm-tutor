In this case the turtle moves along the straight line and accepts commands \\\"T\\\" (\\\"turn around\\\") and \\\"F\\\" (\\\"move 1 unit forward\\\").\\n\\nYou are given a list of commands that will be given to the turtle. You have to change exactly n commands from the list (one command can be changed several times). How far from the starting point can the turtle move after it follows all the commands of the modified list?\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line of input contains a string commands \u2014 the original list of commands. The string commands contains between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive, and contains only characters \\\"T\\\" and \\\"F\\\".\\n\\nThe second line contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 50) \u2014 the number of commands you have to change in the list.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nOutput the maximum distance from the starting point to the ending point of the turtle's path.

'T' means turn around, and 'F' means move one unit forward.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints: We need to modify exactly n commands. The commands string is relatively short (up to 100 chars), and n is also limited (up to 50).\\n- Choosing Algorithmic Strategy: Dynamic Programming appears suitable, as we can explore different combinations of command changes to find the maximum possible distance. We can define a state that represents the current command, the number of changes made so far, and the current direction the turtle is facing.\\n- Implementation Details: We need to track the position of the turtle as well as its direction. A memoization technique can be used to avoid recomputation of the same states. Edge cases to consider are when no changes are allowed (n=0). The result can be negative.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does 'n' represent in the problem and how does it constrain the possible solutions?\",\n    \"How do the 'T' and 'F' commands affect the turtle's position and direction?\",\n    \"Why is dynamic programming a suitable approach for this problem?\",\n    \"What states do you need to define in your dynamic programming solution, and how do they interact with each other?\",\n    \"What edge cases should be handled specifically, and how should they be addressed?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"'n' represents the exact number of commands that must be changed. This limits the search space by requiring every valid solution to involve precisely 'n' changes to the input command string.\",\n    \"'T' changes the turtle's direction (positive to negative, or negative to positive). 'F' moves the turtle one unit forward in its current direction.\",\n    \"Dynamic programming is suitable because it allows exploration of different change combinations. Each subproblem considers the optimal distance with a given number of changes from a prefix of the command string.\",\n    \"The states should include the current position in the command string, the number of changes made so far, and the current direction of the turtle (positive or negative). The interaction between states occurs as the program iterates through the commands, making or not making a change, and updating the position and direction accordingly.\",\n    \"If n = 0, the algorithm should calculate the final position without any changes to the commands. If the final distance is negative, consider returning the absolute value because we want the distance from the starting point\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
