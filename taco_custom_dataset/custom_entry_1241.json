If the input is a string that cannot be converted to a number, it should return \\\"Error\\\".\\n- Handling Data Types: Determine how to handle different data types, specifically distinguishing between numeric values and strings.\\n- Error Handling: Recognize the importance of error handling when the input is not a valid number.\\n- Implementation Strategy: Try to directly perform the arithmetic operation. If a TypeError occurs (indicating that the input is not a number or cannot be coerced into one), catch the exception and return 'Error'.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What should the function return if the input is a number?\",\n    \"What type of error should be caught if the input is not a number?\",\n    \"How can you ensure that the function handles strings appropriately in a language-agnostic way?\",\n    \"How would this function behave with a very large number, and are there any potential overflow issues?\",\n    \"Why is it important to handle the specific TypeError in this context?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The function should return the result of the input number multiplied by 50 and increased by 6 (input * 50 + 6).\",\n    \"A TypeError should be caught.\",\n    \"By attempting the arithmetic operation directly and catching the potential TypeError if the input is a non-numeric string.\",\n    \"The function would behave normally as long as the result does not overflow. If the result overflows it will be dependent on the language implementation.\",\n    \"It's important because a TypeError specifically indicates an operation on incompatible data types (e.g., trying to multiply a string). This ensures that we correctly identify and handle cases where the input is not a valid number.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
