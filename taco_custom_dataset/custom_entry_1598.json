Then check if the number of remaining zeros is at least 3.\\n- Edge Cases and Constraints: Take into account edge cases like empty arrays or arrays with no zeros. Also understand that if there is not equal number of elements before and after the middle zeros the array is not hollow.\\n- Verifying the Conditions: After identifying a potential hollow section, ensure that it comprises only zeros and has a length of at least 3 to satisfy the hollow array conditions.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the necessary conditions for an array to be considered 'hollow' according to the problem statement?\",\n    \"How would you approach identifying the 'middle' of the array in this context?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently check if all remaining elements after stripping are zeros?\",\n    \"What edge cases should be considered, and how would you handle them to avoid incorrect results?\",\n    \"How would your approach change if there were no zeros in the array, or if the zeros were not in the center?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"An array is 'hollow' if it has three or more consecutive zeros in the middle, with an equal number of non-zero elements preceding and following the zeros, and all zeros are in the center of the array.\",\n    \"You can identify the 'middle' by iteratively removing non-zero elements from both ends of the array until you are left with a sub-array that ideally contains only the zero elements.
