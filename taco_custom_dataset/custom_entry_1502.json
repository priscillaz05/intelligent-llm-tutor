"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"Your task is very simple. Just write a function `isAlphabetic(s)`, which takes an input string `s` in lowercase and returns `true`/`false` depending on whether the string is in alphabetical order or not.\\n\\nFor example, `isAlphabetic('kata')` is False as 'a' comes after 'k', but `isAlphabetic('ant')` is True.\\n\\nGood luck :)\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def alphabetic(s):\\n\\treturn sorted(s) == list(s)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The task is to determine if a given string is in alphabetical order.\\n- Identifying Edge Cases: Consider empty strings or strings with single characters, which are inherently in alphabetical order.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy:  One can compare the input string to its sorted version. If they are the same, the string is in alphabetical order.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Convert the string to a list of characters and compare it to the sorted list of the string's characters.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What constitutes a string being in alphabetical order?\",\n    \"What should be returned for an empty string or a string with only one character?\",\n    \"Can you suggest a straightforward approach to determine if a string is alphabetically sorted?\",\n    \"How can the sorted version of the string be efficiently compared to the original string?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A string is in alphabetical order if each character is the same as or comes before the character that follows it, according to lexicographical order.\",\n    \"An empty string or a string with a single character should return true, as they are trivially in alphabetical order.\",\n    \"One approach is to sort the string and then compare it to the original. If the sorted string is identical to the original, the string is in alphabetical order.\",\n    \"The string can be converted to a list of characters, sorted using the sorted() function, and then compared to the original list of characters using the == operator.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
