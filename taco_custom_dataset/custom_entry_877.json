Also, consider the constraint where at least one element has to be deleted.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: A sliding window approach could be used. Alternatively, iterate through the array, keep track of consecutive 1s before and after a 0. When encountering a zero, update the maximum length seen so far by considering the sum of the number of 1s before and after the current 0.\\n- Implementing the Solution: Consider the cases where there are consecutive zeros. Reset the `tot` variable, and assign the previous `tot` value to the `prev` variable. If no 0 is present, return the length of the array minus one since an element must be deleted. In the end, return the largest value between `prev + tot` and the previous result stored in the `ans` variable.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean to return the \\\"size of the longest non-empty subarray containing only 1's\\\"?\",\n    \"How should the code handle the edge case when all the numbers are 1's?\",\n    \"How should the code handle the edge case when there are no 1's?\",\n    \"How would you modify the array and keep track of the longest sub-array of consecutive 1's after removing one number?\",\n    \"After deleting an element, what are some key variables that you need to keep track of?\",\n    \"How does the deletion operation alter the array with respect to consecutive subarrays of 1's?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"It implies finding the maximum number of contiguous 1's in the modified array after the single deletion.\",\n    \"If all numbers are 1's, since we need to delete one element, the length of the longest subarray of 1s would be len(nums)-1.\",\n    \"If there are no 1's, then there is no subarray of 1's, so return 0.\",\n    \"I would keep track of consecutive 1s before a 0, consecutive 1s after a 0, and keep track of the current maximum subarray.
