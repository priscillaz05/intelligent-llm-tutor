It is necessary to trail this cheese to the Jerry's house. There are several entrances in the Jerry's house. Each entrance is a rounded hole having its own radius R. Could you help Jerry to find suitable holes to be survive?\\n\\nYour task is to create a program which estimates whether Jerry can trail the cheese via each hole. The program should print \\\"OK\\\" if Jerry can trail the cheese via the corresponding hole (without touching it). Otherwise the program should print \\\"NA\\\".\\n\\nYou may assume that the number of holes is less than 10000.\\n\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe input is a sequence of datasets. The end of input is indicated by a line containing three zeros.

The goal is to determine if the cheese can pass through a given hole without touching it.\\n- Input Processing: Recognize that the input consists of cheese dimensions (A, B, C), the number of holes (n), and the radius of each hole (Ri).\\n- Determining Cheese Cross-Section: Realize that the smallest cross-section of the cheese must fit through the hole. Since the cheese is a rectangular prism, the smallest cross-section is defined by the two smallest dimensions. Sort the dimensions to easily determine the smallest.\\n- Calculating Diagonal: Calculate the diagonal of the smallest cross-section. The diagonal is the longest possible dimension that must fit through the hole.\\n- Comparing Diagonal with Hole Diameter: Determine if the cheese can fit through the hole by comparing the diagonal of the smallest face with the diameter of the hole. If the diameter of the hole is greater than the diagonal of the rectangle formed by the smallest two sides, print 'OK'. Otherwise, print 'NA'.\\n- Handling End of Input: Recognize that the input ends with a line containing three zeros (0 0 0).\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you determine the smallest face of the cheese parallelepiped?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the diagonal of a rectangle given its sides?\",\n    \"What condition must be met for the cheese to fit through the hole?\",\n    \"How do you handle the end of the input?\",\n    \"Why is it important to consider the smallest cross-section of the cheese instead of any other cross-section?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Sort the dimensions A, B, and C. The two smallest values represent the dimensions of the smallest face.\",\n    \"The diagonal can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: diagonal = sqrt(side1^2 + side2^2).\",\n    \"The diameter of the hole (2 * radius) must be greater than the diagonal of the smallest face of the cheese.\",\n    \"The input ends when a line containing three zeros (0 0 0) is encountered. The program should terminate when this line is read.\",\n    \"Considering the smallest cross-section ensures that if the cheese can fit through the hole, it will fit regardless of the orientation.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
