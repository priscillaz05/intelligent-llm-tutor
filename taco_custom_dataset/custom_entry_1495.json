In other words, D = 12345678910111213141...\\n\\nYou are given a string S. Find the position of the first occurrence of S in D that satisfies one additional constraint: at least one integer that was concatenated to form D occurs entirely within S.\\n\\n------ Input ------ \\n\\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\\nThe first line of each test case contains a string of digits S.\\n\\nIt is guaranteed that S will occur satisfying the given condition somewhere in D.\\n\\n------ Output ------ \\n\\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the minimal position number where S occurs in D under the given condition, modulo 10^{9}+7.

This is because the part 298299300301 doesn't contain any integer completely in it - neither 299, nor 300.

The critical constraint is that S must contain at least one complete integer from D.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints: The constraint that S must contain a complete integer is crucial. We need to consider substrings of S that could represent integers. We also need to find the *minimal* position.\\n- Choosing an Algorithmic Approach:  Iterate through possible lengths of integers K that could be within S. For each length K, try all possible starting positions N within S. Check if the substring S[N:N+K] represents a valid integer.  If it does, construct a string D' by concatenating integers starting from the integer represented by S[N:N+K].  Compare D' with S to find the earliest match.\\n- Optimizing and Avoiding Pitfalls:  Handle the edge case where an integer starts with 0. Efficiently calculate the starting position of the matching string by calculating the length of the initial part of D. Apply the modulo operator at the end, as required.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the main condition that needs to be satisfied by string S in order for it to be a valid match within the infinite string D?\",\n    \"How do we efficiently determine if a substring of S represents a complete integer from the infinite string D?\",\n    \"How do we calculate the starting position of the matching substring in D, considering that D is constructed by concatenating integers?\",\n    \"What edge cases or constraints need to be considered to ensure an accurate and efficient solution?\",\n    \"How should the modulo operation be applied to ensure the output meets the required format?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"String S must contain at least one complete integer that was concatenated to form D.\",\n    \"Iterate through all possible lengths K of integers within S and starting positions N.

This can be done using the calc(w) function mentioned in the solution.  Then subtract the start position (N).\",\n    \"The edge case where an integer starts with '0' is invalid. Also, consider efficiency by breaking the loop if the answer is already found. Also, we should add a possible starting integer beyond the string.\",\n    \"Apply the modulo operator (10^9 + 7) to the final result to ensure the output remains within the specified range.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
