The input first contains the number of test cases T, followed by the inputs for each test case.\",\n    \"The modulo operator (%) gives the remainder when dividing by 10, effectively extracting the last digit. Integer division (//) by 10 removes the last digit from the number.\",\n    \"A while loop is used because the number of digits is not known in advance, and the loop continues as long as the number N is greater than 0.\",\n    \"The termination condition is N > 0. The loop continues as long as there are digits left to process. When N becomes 0, all digits have been processed, and the loop terminates.\",\n    \"The sum of digits is initialized to 0. This ensures that the sum starts from zero and accumulates the value of each digit correctly as the loop progresses.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
