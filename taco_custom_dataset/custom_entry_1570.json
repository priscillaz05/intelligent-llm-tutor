In a given matrix of non-negative integers, it is necessary to replace each value of $0$ with some positive integer so that the resulting matrix is increasing and the sum of its elements is maximum, or find that it is impossible. It is guaranteed that in a given value matrix all values of $0$ are contained only in internal cells (that is, not in the first or last row and not in the first or last column).\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"(n, m) = map(int, input().split())\\na = [[0 for i in range(m)] for j in range(n)]\\nsum1 = 0\\nfg = 0\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\ta[i] = list(map(int, input().split()))\\nfor i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):\\n\\tfor j in range(m - 1, 0, -1):\\n\\t\\tif a[i][j] == 0:\\n\\t\\t\\ta[i][j] = min(a[i + 1][j], a[i][j + 1]) - 1\\n\\t\\tif a[i][j] <= a[i - 1][j] or a[i][j] <= a[i][j - 1]:\\n\\t\\t\\tfg = 1\\n\\t\\t\\tbreak\\nif fg != 1:\\n\\tfor i in range(n):\\n\\t\\tfor j in range(m):\\n\\t\\t\\tsum1 += a[i][j]\\n\\tprint(sum1)\\nelse:\\n\\tprint(-1)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem Requirements: Understand the definition of an increasing matrix. Identify the goal of replacing 0s with positive integers to maximize the sum while maintaining the increasing property. Recognize that zeros only appear in internal cells.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Recognize that replacing zeros greedily might not always lead to a valid increasing matrix. A potential pitfall is ending up with a value that violates the increasing row or column constraint.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Start filling the matrix from the bottom right corner towards the top left. When encountering a zero, determine the maximum possible value based on the values below and to the right of it. Check after the filling process that the increasing row and column constraints are met.\\n- Implementing the Solution: Iterate through the matrix from the bottom right to the top left. If an element is 0, set it to min(element below, element to the right) - 1. After filling, iterate to ensure increasing condition.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for a matrix to be 'increasing' in this problem?\",\n    \"Why are the zeros only located in the internal cells of the matrix?\",\n    \"What is the best strategy for replacing the zeros to maximize the sum while ensuring that the matrix remains increasing?\",\n    \"How can you ensure that the chosen value for a zero doesn't violate the increasing constraints?\",\n    \"After filling all the zeros, what is the next important step to validate that the final matrix satisfies the problem's conditions?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A matrix is 'increasing' if each row strictly increases from left to right, and each column strictly increases from top to bottom.\",\n    \"The problem states that zeros are only in internal cells as a constraint, which affects how we approach filling the matrix, avoiding boundary issues.\",\n    \"Start from the bottom-right corner and fill upwards and to the left.
