This is done because the sum is constant when we choose a[i] + a[n-i-1]. After sorting the employee array, pairing the lowest knowledge employee with the highest knowledge employee, the second lowest with the second highest, and so on will result in minimizing the difference between the team with the highest knowledge level and the team with the lowest knowledge level.\\n- Implementation Details: We'll read the input, sort the employee knowledge levels, form the teams, calculate the team knowledge levels, sort these levels, and output the difference between the maximum and minimum.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the objective function we're trying to minimize in this problem?\",\n    \"Why does sorting the employee knowledge levels help in solving this problem?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the knowledge level of a team?\",\n    \"After calculating each team's knowledge level, what do you need to do to find the lowest possible difference?\",\n    \"What edge cases, if any, might cause issues with the described approach?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The objective function is the difference between the highest team knowledge level and the lowest team knowledge level.  The goal is to minimize this difference.\",\n    \"Sorting allows us to pair the employees with the lowest knowledge level with those of the highest knowledge level, creating teams where the sum of the knowledge level is closest to the same for all the teams, hence minimizing the difference.\",\n    \"The knowledge level of a team is simply the sum of the knowledge levels of the two employees forming the team.\",\n    \"After calculating the knowledge level of each team, you sort the knowledge levels, and the difference between the largest (maximum) and smallest (minimum) knowledge level will be the minimum possible difference.\",\n    \"There are no real edge cases given the constraints. The number of employees is always even, and their knowledge levels are within a defined range.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
