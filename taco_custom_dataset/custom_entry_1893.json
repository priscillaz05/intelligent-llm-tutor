Create a program that takes a certain number as input and outputs a row of abacus beads. However, the number of digits of the abacus to be displayed is 5 digits, and the arrangement of beads from 0 to 9 is as follows using'*' (half-width asterisk),''(half-width blank), and'=' (half-width equal). It shall be expressed as.\\n\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\nMultiple test cases are given.

The abacus has 8 rows, with rows 1 and 2 representing the 5's place (0 or 5) and rows 4-8 representing the 1's place (0-4). The third row consists of `=` characters.\\n- Input handling: The program needs to handle multiple test cases. It should read an integer from the input, and print the abacus representation. An empty line must be printed between test cases.\\n- Abacus representation logic: For each digit, determine which `*` need to be replaced with spaces based on the value of the digit. If the digit is greater than or equal to 5, set the appropriate asterisk on the top rows to space, and remove the amount above 5 in the bottom rows to space. If it is less than 5, only remove the correct lower beads.\\n- Digit extraction: The number must be processed digit by digit, from right to left. The modulo operator (%) can extract the last digit, and integer division (//) removes it.\\n- Array initialization: Use a 2D array to represent the abacus. Each digit occupies one column of the abacus representation. Initially fill the array with `*`. Change it to contain the required characters.\\n- Output: Print the rows of the array, joining the characters in each row into a single string.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you handle multiple test cases in the input and ensure a blank line between the output of each test case?\",\n    \"How should I represent the abacus structure, including the fixed '=====' row and the positions for '*' and ' ' based on the input number?\",\n    \"How do you convert a given decimal number into an abacus representation, taking into account the 5-based and 1-based bead arrangements?\",\n    \"How can I extract digits from the input number and map each digit to the correct bead positions in the abacus representation?\",\n    \"What are the boundary and edge cases, such as input numbers with less than 5 digits or invalid inputs, and how should the program handle them?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"I can use a `while` loop along with a `try-except` block to read inputs until an exception occurs, indicating the end of the input. Before each new abacus representation, except for the first, print an empty line. Use a flag to avoid printing a blank line before the first test case.\",\n    \"Use a 2D array (list of lists) to represent the abacus. Initialize it with '*' characters. Replace the characters in rows 1, 2, and 4-8 based on the value of each digit. Row 3 should be initialized with '====='.\",\n    \"For each digit, check if it is greater than or equal to 5. If so, replace the '*' in the corresponding column of the first row with a space. Then, calculate the remainder when dividing by 5 and determine which '*' characters in rows 4-8 should be replaced with spaces based on that remainder. If the digit is less than 5, only alter the '*' in the lower rows. Make sure to work on the digits from right to left.\",\n    \"Use the modulo operator (%) to extract the last digit and integer division (//) to remove it. Iterate through the digits of the number from right to left (ones place to the ten-thousands place), and for each digit, determine the corresponding bead positions to be changed from '*' to ' '.\",\n    \"Numbers with fewer than 5 digits will effectively have leading zeros, and these digits should be processed as zeros. Since the prompt does not require error handling for invalid input like non-integer, the except case can just break the read loop.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
