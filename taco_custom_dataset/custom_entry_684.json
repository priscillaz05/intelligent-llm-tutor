The remaining parts are combined forming a new table. For example, after removing the second column from the table\\n\\nabcd\\n\\nedfg\\n\\nhijk\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nwe obtain the table:\\n\\nacd\\n\\nefg\\n\\nhjk\\n\\n\\n\\n\u00a0\\n\\nA table is called good if its rows are ordered from top to bottom lexicographically, i.e. each row is lexicographically no larger than the following one.

Understand what it means for rows to be lexicographically non-decreasing (each row is no larger than the one below it).\\n- Developing a Strategy: Iterate through the columns. For each column, check if removing it would make the table 'good' so far. If a column makes two consecutive rows out of order lexicographically, remove it.\\n- Optimization Considerations: If a column is removed, adjust the column index to account for the change in size of the rows.\\n- Edge Cases: Consider the case where the table is already good, or when all columns need to be removed. An empty table (after removing all columns) is defined as 'good'.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for rows to be ordered lexicographically?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently check if removing a column makes the table 'good' so far?\",\n    \"When a column is removed, how should the indexing be adjusted?\",\n    \"What edge cases should be considered?\",\n    \"How is lexicographical order checked if the strings are of different lengths?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"It means that each row is lexicographically no larger than the following row. Specifically, for any two consecutive rows, row i should be less than or equal to row i+1.\",\n    \"Iterate through the rows of the table up to the current column being considered.

If at any point, row i is greater than row i+1 lexicographically, the column must be removed.\",\n    \"Since the column is removed, the length of each row decreases by one. Therefore, the column index must be adjusted by subtracting the number of columns previously removed.\",\n    \"The edge cases include an already good table (no columns need to be removed), a table where all columns need to be removed to make it 'good'.
