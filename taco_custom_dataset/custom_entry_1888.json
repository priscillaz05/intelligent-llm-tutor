The volume is given by  V = (1/3) * pi * h * (R^2 + Rr + r^2)  where R and r are the radii of the top and bottom circles, respectively, and h is the height.\\n- Applying Diameters: Convert diameters to radii by dividing by 2. Rewrite the formula in terms of diameters d1 and d2:  V = (h/12) * pi * (d1^2 + d1*d2 + d2^2)\\n- Implementation Details: Translate the formula into Python code, handling the necessary imports for the pi constant. Ensure the result is rounded to two decimal places as requested.\\n- Handling Constraints: Consider the constraint that all inputs are positive numbers, which simplifies the error handling process since negative or zero values are not possible inputs.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What geometric shape does the cup resemble, and what formula can be used to calculate its volume?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: The cup resembles a frustum of a cone, and the volume can be calculated using the frustum volume formula.\",\n    \"How do you convert the diameters of the top and bottom into values that can be used in the volume formula?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: The diameters need to be converted to radii by dividing each by 2.
