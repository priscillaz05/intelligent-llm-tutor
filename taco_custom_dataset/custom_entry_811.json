Realize the transition between these states is crucial for optimization.\\n- Choosing Dynamic Programming: Given the constraints and the overlapping subproblems (i.e., optimal profit up to a certain day), dynamic programming is a natural choice. The optimal profit on a given day depends on the optimal profits from the previous days.\\n- Handling Cooldown: Understand that after selling, you must have a one-day cooldown before buying again. This affects the state transitions in the dynamic programming approach. Specifically, if you sell on day `i`, you can only buy again on day `i+2` or later.\\n- Defining DP States: Define two arrays: `buys[i]` to represent the maximum profit at day `i` if you are holding a stock after buying, and `sells[i]` to represent the maximum profit at day `i` if you are not holding a stock after selling (or cooling down).\\n- Formulating Recurrence Relations: Derive recurrence relations for `buys[i]` and `sells[i]`.  `sells[i]` can be `sells[i-1]` (no transaction today) or `buys[i-1] + prices[i]` (selling the stock today).  `buys[i]` can be `buys[i-1]` (no transaction today) or `sells[i-2] - prices[i]` (buying the stock today, accounting for the cooldown).\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do the constraints (no concurrent transactions and cooldown period) affect the algorithmic approach?\",\n    \"How would you define the states in a dynamic programming solution, considering the buying, selling, and cooldown periods?\",\n    \"How do you formulate the recurrence relations for the buys and sells states to calculate the maximum profit?\",\n    \"How can you initialize the base cases for the dynamic programming arrays, considering the first few days of stock prices?\",\n    \"How can you ensure that the algorithm considers all possible transaction sequences to find the global maximum profit?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The constraints force consideration of states (buying, selling, cooldown) and dependencies between transactions. The no-concurrent-transactions rule means you can only buy after selling, and the cooldown necessitates tracking profits from at least two days prior when buying again.\",\n    \"We can define two states: buys[i] representing max profit at day i while holding a stock, and sells[i] representing max profit at day i without holding a stock (having sold or cooled down).\",\n    \"sells[i] = max(sells[i-1], buys[i-1] + prices[i]) - either no transaction today, or sell today. buys[i] = max(buys[i-1], sells[i-2] - prices[i]) - either no transaction today, or buy today after cooldown.\",\n    \"buys[0] = -prices[0] (buying on day 0). sells[0] = 0 (no profit yet).
