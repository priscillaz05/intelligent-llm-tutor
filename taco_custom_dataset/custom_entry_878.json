This is because the number of factors of 2 will always be greater than or equal to the number of factors of 5.\\n- Developing an Algorithm: Implement a function to count the number of trailing zeros in a factorial (count factors of 5). Utilize a binary search to efficiently find the smallest 'm' for a given 'n'.\\n- Optimization and Edge Cases: Optimize the zero-counting function using logarithms to efficiently determine the upper bound of the powers of 5 to check.

Since 10 = 2 * 5, and there are always more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeros is equal to the number of factors of 5 in the prime factorization of the factorial.\",\n    \"To efficiently calculate the number of trailing zeros, you can sum the number of multiples of 5, 25, 125, and so on, up to m. This can be done by summing (m // 5) + (m // 25) + (m // 125) + ....\",\n    \"Binary search would be the most efficient algorithm because the number of trailing zeros is a monotonically increasing function of m. It allows you to quickly narrow down the range of possible values for 'm'.\",\n    \"Because the problem states that such a number `m` will exist, we want to make sure we find the smallest.
