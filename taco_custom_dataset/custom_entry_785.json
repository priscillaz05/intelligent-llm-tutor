Help him sort a list (ArrayList in java) full of textbooks by subject, so he can study before the test.\\n\\nThe sorting should **NOT** be case sensitive\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def sorter(textbooks):\\n\\treturn sorted(textbooks, key=str.lower)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: Recognize the need to sort a list of textbook titles alphabetically, ignoring case.\\n- Choosing a Sorting Strategy: Select a sorting method that allows for custom key functions to handle the case-insensitive sorting requirement.\\n- Implementing Case-Insensitive Comparison: Use the `str.lower()` method as the key function to compare strings in a case-insensitive manner.\\n- Returning Sorted List: Ensuring the function returns the sorted list of textbooks.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for the sorting to be case-insensitive, and why is this important in this context?\",\n    \"Which sorting method in Python allows you to specify a custom key for comparison, and how can it be used here?\",\n    \"How does the `str.lower()` function help in achieving case-insensitive sorting?\",\n    \"What should the function return after the textbooks are sorted?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Case-insensitive sorting means that the sorting algorithm should treat uppercase and lowercase letters as equal. This is important because textbook titles may have inconsistent capitalization, and we want to ensure they are sorted alphabetically regardless of case.\",\n    \"The `sorted()` function in Python allows you to specify a custom key using the `key` parameter. This is suitable here because we can use the `str.lower()` function as the key to perform case-insensitive comparisons.\",\n    \"The `str.lower()` function converts a string to lowercase. By using it as the key for sorting, we are effectively comparing the lowercase versions of the textbook titles, ensuring that the sorting is case-insensitive.\",\n    \"The function should return the sorted list of textbooks.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
