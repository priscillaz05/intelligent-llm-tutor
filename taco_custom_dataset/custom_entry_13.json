According to Strange, Chef will live for $L$ years in total. If he wants to go to heaven, he must spend at least $50\\%$ of his life years doing good deeds. He also shows them his future using a string $S$ of length $L$ where $S_{i} = 0$ means the $i$-th year will be counted as bad as per the rule books of heaven and $S_{i} = 1$ means the $i$-th year will be counted as good.\\n\\nAlso, Strange can use his special powers to make Chef end his life earlier than that planned by god, i.e, he can choose some $L'$ ($1\u2264 L'\u2264 L$) and make him live for only $L' $ years. Strange wants Chef to succeed, so if there is any choice of $L'$ that allows Chef to go to heaven, he will do so.\\n\\nTell whether Chef can go to heaven.\\n\\n------ Input ------\\n\\nThe first line contains an integer $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. \\nEach test case contains two lines of input.\\nThe first line contains a single integer $L$.\\nThe second line contains a string $S$ of length $L$, consisting of symbols 0 and 1.\\n\\n------ Output ------\\nFor each test case, output the answer in a single line: \\\"YES\\\" if Chef can go to heaven and \\\"NO\\\" if not (without quotes).\\n\\nYou may print each character of each string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings \\\"yEs\\\", \\\"yes\\\", \\\"Yes\\\" and \\\"YES\\\" will all be treated as identical).\\n\\n------ Constraints ------\\n$1 \u2264 L \u2264 10^{5}$\\nThe sum of $L$ over all tests does not exceed $10^{6}$\\n\\n------ Subtasks ------\\n\\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\\n\\n----- Sample Input 1 ------ \\n3\\n\\n2\\n\\n10\\n\\n3\\n\\n001\\n\\n4\\n\\n0100\\n----- Sample Output 1 ------ \\nYES\\n\\nNO\\n\\nYES\\n----- explanation 1 ------ \\nTest case 1: If Chef lives for the complete $2$ years, he will have a total of $1$ good year which is $\\\\frac{1 * 100}{2} = 50\\\\%$ of his life, and hence he will go to heaven.\\n\\nTest case 2: There's no way Chef can go to heaven.\\n\\nTest case 3: If Chef lives for $2$ years, he will have a total of $1$ good year which is $\\\\frac{1 * 100}{2} = 50\\\\%$ of his life, and hence he will go to heaven.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"for i in range(0, int(input())):\\n\\tn = int(input())\\n\\tl = list(input())\\n\\tt = 0\\n\\ta = 0\\n\\tb = 0\\n\\tfor j in range(0, n):\\n\\t\\tt = t + 1\\n\\t\\tif l[j] == '0':\\n\\t\\t\\ta = a + 1\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tb = b + 1\\n\\t\\tif b >= t / 2:\\n\\t\\t\\tprint('YES')\\n\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\t\\telif j == n - 1 and b < t / 2:\\n\\t\\t\\tprint('NO')\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tcontinue\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires determining if Chef can go to heaven by living a certain number of years (L') such that at least 50% of those years are 'good' (represented by '1' in the string S).\\n- Identifying Potential Strategies: Iterate through possible values of L' from 1 to L. For each L', calculate the number of good years and check if the percentage of good years is at least 50%. If a valid L' is found, output 'YES'. Otherwise, if no such L' exists, output 'NO'.\\n- Edge Case Handling: Consider the case when no '1' is present in the string. In such scenarios, irrespective of L', it's not possible to have >= 50% '1's. Also, consider L = 1, if S[0] = '1', then YES else NO.\\n- Optimizing the Calculation: For each L', calculating the number of '1's can be done in O(L') time. The overall time complexity is O(L^2) in the worst case. In the given solution, the program breaks after it finds one scenario where Chef can go to heaven. It reduces computational costs in some cases.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the constraints on the length of the string L?\",\n    \"What does it mean for Chef to go to heaven in terms of the '0' and '1' characters in the string?\",\n    \"How would you approach the problem if L is very large, like 10^5?\",\n    \"What edge cases should you handle?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the percentage of good years for a given L'?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"L is between 1 and 10^5, and the sum of L over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\",\n    \"Chef goes to heaven if at least 50% of the years he lives are good, i.e., represented by '1' in the string S.\",\n    \"If L is large, iterating through all possible L' values from 1 to L and calculating the number of '1's for each L' may be time-consuming. Consider using a cumulative sum to make calculating the percentage of ones more efficient. However, the provided ground truth solution is accepted, thus efficiency is not the most critical concern.\",\n    \"Edge cases include when the string S contains only '0's, or when L = 1. When S contains only 0's, the answer is always NO. When L=1, answer is YES if S[0] = '1' else NO.\",\n    \"For a given L', iterate through the first L' characters of S, count the number of '1's (good years), and divide by L'. If this fraction is >= 0.5, Chef goes to heaven for that L'.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
