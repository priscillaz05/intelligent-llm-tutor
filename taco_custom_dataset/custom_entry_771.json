As you may know this algorithm shuffles the sequence randomly until it is sorted. Johnny decided that we don't need to shuffle the whole sequence every time. If after the last shuffle several first elements end up in the right places we will fix them and don't shuffle those elements furthermore. We will do the same for the last elements if they are in the right places. For example, if the initial sequence is (3, 5, 1, 6, 4, 2) and after one shuffle Johnny gets (1, 2, 5, 4, 3, 6) he will fix 1, 2 and 6 and proceed with sorting (5, 4, 3) using the same algorithm. Johnny hopes that this optimization will significantly improve the algorithm. Help him calculate the expected amount of shuffles for the improved algorithm to sort the sequence of the first n natural numbers given that no elements are in the right places initially.\\n\\n------ Input ------ \\n\\nThe first line of input file is number t - the number of test cases.

The modification involves fixing elements at the beginning and end of the sequence that are already in the correct positions after each shuffle.\\n- Identifying Key Components: The core of the problem is understanding how many permutations leave no element in its original position, and how this changes as we 'fix' elements at the beginning and end.\\n- Developing an Algorithm: We can precompute the expected number of shuffles for each n up to 150. To compute the expected number of shuffles for n, we will need to calculate the number of derangements of n (permutations where no element is in its original position) and also consider the recursion implied by fixing elements at the beginning and end after each shuffle. The expected number of shuffles E(n) can be calculated recursively using the number of derangements of smaller arrays.\\n- Implementing in Python: Implement the recursive relation using dynamic programming to make it efficient. Pre-compute factorials, derangements, and the expected values and print the requested result.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the key differences between the original bogosort and the improved version described in the problem?\",\n    \"How does 'fixing' elements at the start and end of the sequence after each shuffle affect the calculation of the expected number of shuffles?\",\n    \"What is a derangement and why is it important in solving this problem?\",\n    \"How can dynamic programming techniques optimize the solution to calculate the expected amount of shuffles for different values of n?\",\n    \"How do I represent the expected number of shuffles as an irreducible fraction in Python?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The improved bogosort fixes correctly placed elements at the beginning and end of the sequence after each shuffle, which reduces the size of the sequence to be shuffled in subsequent iterations.\",\n    \"Fixing elements reduces the size of the array being shuffled, which changes the probabilities and expected number of shuffles needed for the remaining unsorted segment.\",\n    \"A derangement is a permutation of a set where no element appears in its original position. It is important because it represents the case where a shuffle requires further shuffles.\",\n    \"Dynamic programming helps by storing previously calculated values for smaller subproblems (smaller values of n), preventing redundant calculations and improving efficiency.\",\n    \"I can use the fractions module in Python to represent and simplify the expected number of shuffles as an irreducible fraction. This involves calculating the numerator and denominator and then reducing the fraction to its simplest form.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
