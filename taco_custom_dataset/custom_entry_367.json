She became good friends with local flea residents and played beautiful music for them every day.\\n\\nIn return, the fleas made a bigger ukulele for her: it has $n$ strings, and each string has $(10^{18} + 1)$ frets numerated from $0$ to $10^{18}$. The fleas use the array $s_1, s_2, \\\\ldots, s_n$ to describe the ukulele's tuning, that is, the pitch of the $j$-th fret on the $i$-th string is the integer $s_i + j$.\\n\\nMiyako is about to leave the kingdom, but the fleas hope that Miyako will answer some last questions for them.\\n\\nEach question is in the form of: \\\"How many different pitches are there, if we consider frets between $l$ and $r$ (inclusive) on all strings?\\\"\\n\\nMiyako is about to visit the cricket kingdom and has no time to answer all the questions.

The pitch at fret j on string i is s_i + j. The main challenge is to efficiently count distinct pitches for multiple queries.\\n- Data Structures and Preprocessing: Since n and q are up to 100,000, and the fret values and tuning can be up to 10^18, direct calculation for each query might be too slow. Sorting the tuning values (s_i) could help identify overlapping pitch ranges.\\n- Algorithm Design: A sweep line approach combined with precomputation might be optimal. Calculate the differences between consecutive sorted s_i values (stoppers). Process queries offline, sorting them by the range size (r - l). Use a variable to maintain the number of overlapping pitches as we increment the query range.\\n- Optimizations and Edge Cases: The key optimization is to avoid iterating through all the strings for each query. We need to find a way to precompute or incrementally update the number of distinct pitches as the fret range changes. Integer overflows with large numbers can be an issue that has to be dealt with. The constraints given in the prompt should allow for reasonable execution time.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does sorting the tuning values (s_i) help in efficiently counting the distinct pitches?\",\n    \"Can you describe the sweep line approach in more detail and how it reduces the computational complexity?\",\n    \"What data structure can be used to efficiently track the number of distinct pitches as the range changes?\",\n    \"What are the crucial steps to consider to avoid integer overflows when dealing with large values?\",\n    \"How does sorting the queries by range size help optimize the process?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Sorting tuning values helps to identify the differences between the minimum pitches of the strings. This allows us to efficiently determine overlaps in pitch ranges as we consider different fret ranges for the queries.\",\n    \"The sweep line approach involves processing the queries in a specific order (e.g., by range size) and maintaining state that is incrementally updated. This avoids recalculating distinct pitches from scratch for each query. You add or remove intervals from the sweep line as the range increases.\",\n    \"A counter or a set can be used to track the number of distinct pitches efficiently as the range changes. A counter might be enough because the numbers are consecutive. If the numbers were not consecutive, a set or hashmap would be a better way to keep track of distinct values.\",\n    \"Use appropriate data types (e.g., long long in C++, or Python's arbitrary-precision integers) to store large values. When performing arithmetic operations, ensure that intermediate results also fit within the data type's range to prevent overflow.\",\n    \"Sorting the queries by range size allows for incremental computation of distinct pitches. As we move from a smaller range to a larger range, we can reuse previously computed information and only update the count for the additional frets, leading to better performance.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
