If 'i' is a common divisor, check if 'A/i' and 'B/i' are also common divisors to optimize. \\n- Handling Edge Cases: Recognize that 1 is always a common divisor if both A and B are positive. Consider cases where either A or B might be 0 (although the constraints specify they are not, good practice to consider).\\n- Efficiently Counting Divisors: Use a loop to check for divisibility and manage counting logic.
