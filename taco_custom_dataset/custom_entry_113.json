This is because the divisors of p^2 (where p is a prime) are 1, p, and p^2.\\n- Identifying Constraints: Understand that the queries range from 1 to 10^12, which means directly iterating and checking each number up to 10^12 is not feasible. Also, realize that we need to precompute and store valid numbers.\\n- Selecting an Algorithm: Since the numbers with three divisors are squares of prime numbers, we need to find prime numbers whose squares are less than or equal to the query. An efficient way to do this is to generate a list of primes up to the square root of the maximum query value and then for each query, count how many primes have squares less than or equal to that query.\\n- Optimizing for Efficiency: Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to efficiently generate prime numbers. Then, precompute the squares of the primes to avoid recalculating repeatedly during each query. Finally, store the squares of primes and use binary search to count the number of squares less than the given query for each query.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Why are numbers with exactly three divisors always squares of prime numbers?\",\n    \"What is the most efficient way to find a list of prime numbers up to a certain limit?\",\n    \"How can you optimize the process of finding the count of numbers with three divisors for multiple queries?\",\n    \"What range of prime numbers needs to be considered when query[i] can go up to 10^12?\",\n    \"How does the `bisect_left` function help in finding the solution efficiently?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A number has exactly three divisors if and only if it's the square of a prime number (p^2).
