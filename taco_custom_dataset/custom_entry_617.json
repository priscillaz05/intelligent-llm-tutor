Understand that a number is \\\"Very Cool\\\" if its Coolness is greater than or equal to K. The goal is to count the number of Very Cool integers within the range [1, R].\\n- Converting to Binary: Convert each number in the range [1, R] to its binary representation.\\n- Counting \\\"101\\\" occurrences: For each binary string, count the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring \\\"101\\\".\\n- Comparing Coolness to K: For each number, compare its Coolness (number of \\\"101\\\" occurrences) to K. If the Coolness is greater than or equal to K, increment a counter.\\n- Returning the Count: After iterating through all numbers from 1 to R, return the final count of Very Cool integers.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Consider edge cases or constraints like the maximum value of R and K. Be mindful of potential performance bottlenecks when processing a large range of numbers.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you convert an integer into its binary representation in Python?\",\n    \"How would you efficiently search for the number of occurrences of a substring within a string in Python?\",\n    \"How would you optimize the process if R is large (e.g., R = 10^5) to avoid unnecessary computations?\",\n    \"What are the potential edge cases and how would you handle them?\",\n    \"Can you explain your strategy for iterating through numbers, converting them to binary, and checking their coolness?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"You can use the `bin()` function to convert an integer to its binary representation. Remember to remove the \\\"0b\\\" prefix from the returned string.\",\n    \"You can use the `string.count()` method to count occurrences. However, since '101' occurrences can't overlap (as implied from the problem definition), you may need to increment your search position carefully after each count to avoid recounting overlapping sequences.\",\n    \"Since we iterate from 1 to R, for each number, the main bottleneck is the `count` operation on the binary strings. Converting numbers to binary is unavoidable. Given the constraints (R <= 10^5), the process can be done within a reasonable amount of time. Using more efficient string operations can reduce the complexity of the substring search.\",\n    \"Edge cases could include when R is very small (e.g., 1), K is very large, and when no '101' exists in any of the binary strings. The provided code does not explicitly handle edge cases but implicitly works correctly for such test cases.\",\n    \"For each test case, I will iterate through each number from 1 to R. Inside the loop, I will convert the current number to its binary representation using the bin() function. Then, I will search for all non-overlapping occurrences of the string \\\"101\\\" in the binary representation. I increment a counter each time I find the \\\"101\\\" pattern. If this counter is greater than or equal to K, I will increment my \\\"Very Cool\\\" numbers counter. Finally, after processing all the numbers in the range, I return the \\\"Very Cool\\\" numbers counter.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
