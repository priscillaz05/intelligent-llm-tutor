At the end, there is only one participant with the maximum points. In the course of the contest, the number of points is written in the line as\\n\\n\\\"name points\\\", where name is the participant's name and points is, the number of points is gained.\\n\\nIf the point is negative, this means the participant has lost in the round. If two partcipants have the maximum number of points, then winners is the one who scored at least m points first.\\n\\nIntially each participant has 0 points. It's guranteed that at the end of the game at least one participant has a positive number of points.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line contains an integer N, total number of rounds.

Recognize that the task is to determine the winner based on the highest score and the earliest time the score was reached.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Consider the case of multiple participants having the same highest score. Handle negative scores appropriately. Track the scores of each participant throughout the rounds.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Maintain a dictionary to store the running score of each participant. Iterate through the rounds, updating scores accordingly. Keep track of when each participant reaches certain score levels. Determine the winner by finding the participant with the highest score and, in the case of a tie, the participant who first achieved that score.\\n- Implementing the Solution: Read the number of rounds from the input. Use a loop to process each round, splitting the input line to extract the participant's name and score. Update the score in the dictionary. After all rounds, find the highest score. Determine the winner by checking for ties and selecting the first participant to reach the highest score.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you handle the case where multiple participants have the same maximum score?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: In the event of a tie for the highest score, the winner is the participant who reached that score first during the rounds.\",\n    \"How can you store and update the scores of the participants?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: A dictionary can be used where the keys are participant names, and the values are their running scores. This dictionary should be updated in each round.\",\n    \"What happens when a participant's score is negative?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: A negative score means the participant lost points, so the score in the dictionary should be decremented accordingly.\",\n    \"How do you determine the final winner after processing all the rounds?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: After processing all the rounds, find the maximum score achieved by any participant. The winner is the participant who first achieved the maximum score.\",\n    \"How would you efficiently determine which participant achieved the maximum score first, given the chronological order of rounds?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: Iterate through each round and keep track of the current max score and the user name. if a user matches the maximum score at the end of the round, save the user name. This way at the end of the loop, user name will indicate the user who got the max score first.\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"In the event of a tie for the highest score, the winner is the participant who reached that score first during the rounds.\",\n    \"A dictionary can be used where the keys are participant names, and the values are their running scores.
