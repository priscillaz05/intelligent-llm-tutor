It's Pros and Cons Time!\\n\\nThere is a long list of n girls in front of Barney, and he is to calculate the optimal \\\"happiness\\\" he can find by selecting exactly 2 girls. (Why 2? No one knows!)\\n\\nTed, as a fan of pros and cons, suggests to make a list, a method for estimating the maximum happiness that Barney can achieve. \\n\\nEach girl is characterized by two parameters:\\n\\n- favour: if this girl is chosen, his happiness increases by this amount. \\n- anger: if this girl is not chosen, his happiness decreases by this amount.\\n\\nFind the maximum \\\"happiness\\\" that Barney can obtain. Note that the answer is allowed to be negative.\\n\\nInput:\\nThe first line of input file contains an integer t, denoting the number of test cases to follow.\\n\\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer n, as explained in statement.\\nIt is followed by n lines, each containing two space-seperated integers denoting the favour and anger of the ith girl.\\n\\nOutput:\\nThe output file should contain t lines, each containing answer for the test case.\\n\\nConstraints:\\n1 \u2264 t \u2264 10\\n2 \u2264 n \u2264 1e5\\n0 \u2264 favour[i], anger[i] \u2264 1e9\\nNone of the input files exceed 4MB.\\n\\nSAMPLE INPUT\\n1\\n4\\n2 3\\n10 2\\n11 5\\n4 1\\n\\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\\n17\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def HQ(h, a, A):\\n\\treturn h + a - float(A) / 2\\n\\n\\nt = int(input())\\nwhile t > 0:\\n\\tt -= 1\\n\\tn = int(input())\\n\\tlist_a = list()\\n\\tfor i in range(n):\\n\\t\\tlist_a.append([int(i) for i in input().strip().split(' ')])\\n\\n\\tA = sum([i[1] for i in list_a])\\n\\tH = sorted([HQ(i[0], i[1], A) for i in list_a], reverse=True)\\n\\tprint(int(H[0] + H[1]))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The goal is to maximize happiness by choosing exactly two girls from a list, considering the favour (happiness increase if chosen) and anger (happiness decrease if not chosen) associated with each girl.\\n- Defining Happiness: The happiness is calculated as the sum of favours of the two chosen girls minus the sum of angers of the remaining girls.\\n- Optimization Strategy: To maximize happiness, we need to find the two girls that provide the highest net benefit. A good approach is to calculate a score for each girl and then pick the two girls with the highest scores.\\n- Calculating Scores: For each girl, the 'score' can be defined as their favour plus their anger, minus half of the sum of all angers. The favour and anger are added to account for the girl chosen and unchosen.\\n- Implementation Details:  The total anger for all girls can be precomputed. Sorting scores is helpful in efficiently finding two best score values.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you calculate the net happiness increase for selecting two girls, given their favor and anger values, and the anger values of the other girls?\",\n    \"What is the optimal strategy to identify the two girls that yield the maximum net happiness?\",\n    \"How can you define a combined score or value for each girl that helps determine their contribution to the overall happiness?\",\n    \"Given that the total anger affects the net happiness, how can we efficiently compute and use this information to find the optimal selection?\",\n    \"What considerations are necessary when implementing this solution to ensure that it can handle the specified input constraints, particularly regarding the size of the input and potential negative happiness values?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The net happiness increase is calculated as the sum of the 'favour' values of the two chosen girls, minus the sum of the 'anger' values of all the girls who were not chosen (n-2 girls).\",\n    \"The optimal strategy is to compute a score for each girl, and select the top two scores to maximize happiness. This score needs to account for both favor and anger values.\",\n    \"A combined score can be calculated for each girl by adding her favour value to her anger value and substracting half of the total anger. This score captures how much that girl contribute when she is choosen. This formula implicitly calculates the total anger decrease when a girl is chosen.\",\n    \"The total anger value for all girls should be computed before starting to calculate individual scores, and then each individual score is the favor + anger - total_anger/2. The precomputed value avoids redundant calculations and improves efficiency.\",\n    \"Ensure that the calculations can handle large integer values (up to 1e9) without overflow. Use appropriate data types. Also make sure that algorithm is efficient enough to handle a list of up to 1e5 girls.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
