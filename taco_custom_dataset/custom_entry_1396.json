Stop when the digit 'c' is found or when a repeating remainder is encountered or when a maximum limit of iterations is reached to prevent infinite loops.\\n- Edge Cases: If 'c' is not found after a sufficient number of iterations, the function should return -1.\\n- Implementation details: Perform long division. Keep track of remainders and the generated digits. Ensure that the loop terminates when a repeating remainder is encountered. Output the position of the first occurence, if found.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Could you explain the process of converting a fraction a/b into its decimal representation and how to identify the digits after the decimal point?\",\n    \"How do you identify repeating decimals and prevent infinite loops during the conversion process?\",\n    \"What is the significance of tracking the remainders in the long division process?\",\n    \"How do you determine the first position (index) of the digit 'c' after the decimal point?\",\n    \"What would you return if the digit 'c' is not found in the decimal representation of the fraction, or if a repeating remainder is detected?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"To convert a fraction a/b to its decimal representation, perform long division. The whole part is a // b. The remainder r is a % b. Multiply the remainder by 10 and integer divide by b to get the first digit after the decimal point, and update remainder accordingly. Repeat the process.\",\n    \"Repeating decimals can be identified by tracking the remainders in the long division process. If a remainder repeats, the decimal expansion will also repeat from that point onwards. To prevent infinite loops, set a maximum iteration limit.

Increment the count for each digit. When 'c' is found, the current count is the answer.\",\n    \"If the digit 'c' is not found in the decimal representation or if a repeating remainder is detected within a predefined number of iterations, return -1, indicating that 'c' does not appear or appears too far in the decimal expansion to be practically determined.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
