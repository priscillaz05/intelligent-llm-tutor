The problem requires returning a list of roots of the trees in the resulting forest.\\n- Data Structures: Use a set to efficiently check if a node's value is in the to_delete list. This improves lookup time.\\n- Recursive Tree Traversal: Implement a recursive function that traverses the tree.\\n- Identifying Key Edge Cases and Scenarios: Handle the case where the root node itself needs to be deleted. The return value of the recursive function determines whether the parent's child pointer should be updated.\\n- Building the Forest: Accumulate the root nodes of the remaining trees in a list. A key aspect is recognizing new roots that were originally children of deleted nodes.\\n- Maintaining Root Status: Pass a flag indicating whether the current node could be the root of a new tree (is_root).\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you efficiently check if a node's value is in the to_delete list to optimize performance?\",\n    \"If the root node itself is in the to_delete list, how would this impact the initial setup and the return list?\",\n    \"Explain how the recursive calls help determine whether a node should be the root of a new tree in the forest after deletion.\",\n    \"How does the is_root parameter get updated as the recursion proceeds, and why is it important?\",\n    \"How would you handle a scenario where a parent node is not in to_delete but its children are? How would this affect the composition of the forest?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Using a set for the to_delete list allows for O(1) lookup time, which is much faster than searching a list, especially for larger to_delete lists.\",\n    \"If the root is in to_delete, it is deleted. Its children, if they exist and aren't in to_delete, become the roots of new trees. You need to ensure that these new roots are added to the result list.\",\n    \"The recursive calls help check each node. If a node to be deleted has children, the recursive call ensures that non-deleted children can be added as roots to the forest.\",\n    \"The is_root parameter is updated to True when the parent node is deleted, thus indicating that the current node could potentially be a new root. This is crucial for identifying new trees in the forest.\",\n    \"If a parent node is not in to_delete but its children are, the parent node will have its child pointers updated to None where the children were deleted, and no new roots are added in those places.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
