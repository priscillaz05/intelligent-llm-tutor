"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"I have started studying electronics recently, and I came up with a circuit made up of 2 LEDs and 3 buttons.\\n\\nHere 's how it works: 2 buttons (`red` and `blue`) are connected to the LEDs (`red` and `blue` respectively). Buttons pressing pattern will be remembered and represented through the LEDs when the third button is pressed.\\n\\n - Only one LED can blink at a time.\\n - The LED will only blink once even if the button is held down.\\n - The button must be released to be pressed again.\\n - If a button is pressed while the other button is being held down, it will be ignored.\\n - If two buttons are pressed simultaneously, the red button will be preferred.\\n - If a button is released while the other is being held down, the other 's LED will blink.\\n - `0` is up and `1` is down.\\n - The two inputs will always have the same length.\\n \\nHere is an example:\\n\\n```Python\\nRed:  \\\"10011010\\\"\\nBlue: \\\"10110111\\\"\\n#=> \\\"RBRB\\\"\\n\\nRed:  \\\"01001000\\\"\\nBlue: \\\"01011100\\\"\\n#=> \\\"RB\\\"\\n\\nRed:  \\\"01101000\\\"\\nBlue: \\\"00111000\\\"\\n#=> \\\"RB\\\"\\n```\\n\\nPS:\\n\\nThis is my first time making a kata, so there may be some errors. \\nYou may report to me if the description is too confusing. \\nSorry for my poor grammar.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def button_sequences(seqR, seqB):\\n\\t(pattern, state) = ('', '')\\n\\ttoBool = lambda seq: [i == '1' for i in seq]\\n\\tfor (red, blue) in zip(toBool(seqR), toBool(seqB)): \\n\\t\\tif red and state == 'R' or (blue and state == 'B'):\\n\\t\\t\\tcontinue\\n\\t\\tstate = 'R' if red else 'B' if blue else ''\\n\\t\\tpattern += state\\n\\treturn pattern\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understand the problem: The task is to simulate a simple electronic circuit with two LEDs and two buttons. The goal is to determine the sequence of LED blinks based on button presses, following specific rules.\\n- Consider the rules: Only one LED can blink at a time. An LED blinks only once per press. Button must be released to be pressed again. If a button is pressed while the other is held, ignore it. Red button is preferred in simultaneous presses. If a button is released while the other is held, the other's LED blinks. '0' means button up, and '1' means button down.\\n- Identify key variables: We need to keep track of the current state (which button is held down) and the resulting pattern (sequence of LED blinks).\\n- Develop an algorithm: Iterate through the input sequences (Red and Blue), check the button states, apply the rules, and update the pattern based on which LED should blink. Consider edge cases and priorities as laid out in the prompt.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can the input sequences be efficiently processed to determine the state of each button at each moment?\",\n    \"How do the rules interact, and how should they be prioritized during the sequence processing?\",\n    \"Given the constraint that only one LED can blink at a time, how do we handle simultaneous button presses or releases?\",\n    \"What data structures are best suited to represent the current state of the buttons and the resulting blink sequence?\",\n    \"How should the edge cases (e.g., an empty input sequence or simultaneous button state changes) be handled to ensure correct behavior?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Convert the string sequences to boolean arrays for easier processing. Iterate through these arrays simultaneously using zip to get the states of both buttons at each step.\",\n    \"The 'red button priority' rule must be applied first when both are pressed. The 'only blink once' and 'button must be released' rules must be accounted for in the state transition logic.\",\n    \"In the case of simultaneous presses, prioritize the red button. If both buttons are released at the same time, it should result in no LED blink in the present time step.\",\n    \"A string can be used to accumulate the blink sequence (pattern). A single character ('R', 'B', or empty string) can represent the current button state.\",\n    \"Empty sequences should return an empty string. Simultaneous state changes should be handled based on the priority rules; the red button should take precedence. Always return empty string if none of the rules apply.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
