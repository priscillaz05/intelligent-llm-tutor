"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"From wikipedia  \\n\\nIn number theory and combinatorics, a partition of a positive integer n, also called an integer partition, \\nis a way of writing n as a sum of positive integers. \\nTwo sums that differ only in the order of their summands are considered the **same** partition.\\n\\nFor example, 4 can be partitioned in five distinct ways:\\n\\n`4, 3 + 1, 2 + 2, 2 + 1 + 1, 1 + 1 + 1 + 1`.\\n\\nWe can write:\\n\\n`enum(4) -> [[4],[3,1],[2,2],[2,1,1],[1,1,1,1]]` and\\n\\n`enum(5) -> [[5],[4,1],[3,2],[3,1,1],[2,2,1],[2,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1]]`.\\n\\nThe number of parts in a partition grows very fast.\\nFor n = 50 number of parts is `204226`, for 80 it is `15,796,476`\\nIt would be too long to tests answers with arrays of such size. So our task is the following:\\n\\n1 - n being given (n integer, 1 <= n <= 50) calculate enum(n) ie the partition of n.\\nWe will obtain something like that:  \\n`enum(n) -> [[n],[n-1,1],[n-2,2],...,[1,1,...,1]]` (order of array and sub-arrays\\ndoesn't matter). This part is not tested.\\n\\n2 - For each sub-array of enum(n) calculate its product. \\nIf n = 5 we'll obtain **after removing duplicates and sorting**:\\n\\n`prod(5) -> [1,2,3,4,5,6]`\\n\\n`prod(8) -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18]`\\n\\nIf n = 40 prod(n) has a length of `2699` hence the tests will not verify such arrays.\\nInstead our task number 3 is:\\n\\n3 - return the range, the average and the median of prod(n) in the following form \\n(example for n = 5):\\n\\n`\\\"Range: 5 Average: 3.50 Median: 3.50\\\"`\\n\\nRange is an integer, Average and Median are float numbers rounded to two decimal \\nplaces (\\\".2f\\\" in some languages).\\n\\n#Notes:\\n`Range` : difference between the highest and lowest values. \\n\\n`Mean or Average` : To calculate mean, add together all of the numbers \\nin a set and then divide the sum by the total count of numbers.\\n\\n`Median` : The median is the number separating the higher half \\nof a data sample from the lower half. \\n(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median)\\n\\n#Hints:\\nTry to optimize your program to avoid timing out.\\n\\nMemoization can be helpful but it is not mandatory for being successful.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def prod(n):\\n\\tret = [{1.0}]\\n\\tfor i in range(1, n + 1):\\n\\t\\tret.append({(i - x) * j for (x, s) in enumerate(ret) for j in s})\\n\\treturn ret[-1]\\n\\ndef part(n):\\n\\tp = sorted(prod(n))\\n\\treturn 'Range: %d Average: %.2f Median: %.2f' % (p[-1] - p[0], sum(p) / len(p), (p[len(p) // 2] + p[~len(p) // 2]) / 2)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem involves finding all integer partitions of a number `n`, calculating the product of each partition, removing duplicates, and then calculating the range, average, and median of the resulting products.\\n- Optimization Strategy: Since calculating the partitions can be computationally expensive, it's crucial to optimize the process. Memoization is suggested to avoid recalculating the same partitions multiple times.\\n- Data Structures: Use sets to efficiently eliminate duplicates in the products.\\n- Calculation of Metrics: Make sure to calculate the range, average, and median correctly, paying attention to the required formatting for the output string.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can we efficiently generate the integer partitions of `n` and store their products without duplicates?\",\n    \"What is the best way to optimize the generation of integer partitions for larger values of `n` to avoid exceeding the time limit?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the range, average, and median, and how should the result be formatted in the final string?\",\n    \"Can you outline a strategy to build the partitions without generating all of them first?\",\n    \"Is there a way to generate the products directly without needing to find the partitions?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Generate partitions and store products in a set to eliminate duplicates. A set provides fast lookups and insertion.\",\n    \"Memoization is beneficial. Store the results of smaller partitions in a dictionary or cache to avoid recomputing them when needed for larger partitions.\",\n    \"The range is the difference between the max and min value in the set of products. The average is the sum of all products divided by the number of products. The median is the middle element when the set of products is sorted (or the average of the two middle elements if the number of products is even). Format as specified in the problem description using string formatting.\",\n    \"Yes, start with the original number `n`. Iteratively break it down into smaller parts, keeping track of the products.\",\n    \"Yes. You can modify dynamic programming approach to keep track of a set of products. Start with product equal to 1. Then iterate through 1 to n, keep adding ith number to each partition we have, which will result in new possible products. Save each product to set to avoid duplicates.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
