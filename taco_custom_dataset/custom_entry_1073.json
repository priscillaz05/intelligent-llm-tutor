A / B = K, which implies A = K * B. L <= A <= R and X <= B <= Y.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Consider the constraint ranges and how they influence the existence of A and B. Optimize the search to stay within these ranges.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Since the constraints are within a reasonable range (1 to 10^6), a binary search approach on the possible values of B seems suitable. By iterating through possible values of B, we can find corresponding values of A and check if both A and B meet the given conditions.\\n- Implementing Efficient Range Checking: Ensure that the calculated value of A is within the range [L, R] and that B is within the range [X, Y].\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the constraints on A and B given L, R, X, and Y?\",\n    \"If we iterate through possible values of B, how do we efficiently check for a corresponding valid value of A?\",\n    \"What range should we consider for B during our search to ensure efficiency and correctness?\",\n    \"How can we determine that no solution exists within the given constraints?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A must be within the range [L, R] and B must be within the range [X, Y].
