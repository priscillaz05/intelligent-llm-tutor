If at least one such C exists, output \\\"Yes\\\"; otherwise, output \\\"No\\\".\\n- Optimization: Notice that if both A and B are odd, any odd C will result in an odd product. Hence check if A and B are odd, in that case C=1 satisfies the condition, so output 'Yes'.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the possible values for A, B, and C?\",\n    \"What condition must be satisfied for the product A * B * C to be odd?\",\n    \"How would you check whether a number is odd or even?\",\n    \"What is the most efficient way to check if at least one C results in an odd product?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A, B, and C can each be 1, 2, or 3.\",\n    \"For the product A * B * C to be odd, A, B, and C must all be odd.\",\n    \"You can check if a number is odd by checking if its remainder when divided by 2 is 1.\",\n    \"Iterate through C from 1 to 3 and check if the product is odd.
