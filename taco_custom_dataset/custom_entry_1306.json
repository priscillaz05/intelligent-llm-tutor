BST has the following property (duplicate nodes are possible):\\n\\tThe left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node\u2019s key.\\n\\tThe right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node\u2019s key.\\nInput:\\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line of each test case consists of integer N, denoting the number of elements in the BST. The second line of each test case consists of N space-separated integers denoting the elements in the BST.\\nOutput:\\nFor each testcase, in a new line, print the sum of leaf nodes.\\nYour Task:\\nThis is a function problem. You don't have to take any input. You are required to complete the function sumOfLeafNodes that takes root as parameter and returns the sum of leaf nodes. \\nConstraints:\\n1 <= T <= 10^{3}     \\n1 <= N <= 10^{5}\\nExample:\\nInput:\\n2\\n6\\n67 34 82 12 45 78\\n1\\n45\\nOutput:\\n135\\n45\\nExplanation:\\nIn first test case, the BST for the given input will be-\\n               67\\n          /             \\\\\\n   34                  82\\n  /    \\\\                /\\n12   45         78\\nHence, the required sum= 12 + 45 + 78 = 135\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def inorder(root):\\n\\treturn [] if not root else [root.data] if not root.right and (not root.left) else inorder(root.left) + inorder(root.right)\\n\\ndef sumOfLeafNodes(root):\\n\\treturn sum(inorder(root))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem Requirements: Recognizing the need to traverse a binary search tree (BST) and identify leaf nodes. Understand leaf nodes are nodes without left and right children.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Handling edge cases, such as an empty tree (root is None). Ensuring correct identification of leaf nodes in the presence of only one child.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Choosing a traversal strategy (e.g., inorder, preorder, postorder) that effectively explores the tree. Deciding whether to use recursion or iteration for the traversal.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Summing leaf node values efficiently.
