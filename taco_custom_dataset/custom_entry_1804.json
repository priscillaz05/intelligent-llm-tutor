Thus, n*a = num - n*(n+1)/2.  Therefore, a = (num/n) - (n+1)/2, and `a` must be a non-negative integer.\\n- Finding the Upper Limit: The upper limit is set by the need for a to be non-negative: num/n >= (n+1)/2.  Thus n^2 + n <= 2*num. n*(n+1)/2 <= num. We use this to determine the upper_limit\\n- Coding the Logic: Iterate through possible values of n from 1 up to upper_limit. Check if `num` can be represented as a sum of `n` consecutive numbers.\\n- Consider Even and Odd n:  If n is odd, n should be a factor of num and a will be an integer. If n is even, num % n == n /2. Thus, we check both of these conditions and update the count.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the constraints on `n` and `a` (the starting value of the consecutive sequence)?\",\n    \"How can the formula  `a = (num/n) - (n+1)/2`  be used to check whether `num` can be expressed as a sum of `n` consecutive positive integers?\",\n    \"How do you determine when to stop checking larger values of `n`?\",\n    \"How should you handle cases where `n` is even versus cases where `n` is odd?\",\n    \"How does the definition of a positive number (`> 0`) impact the logic of the code?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"`n` must be a positive integer (representing the length of the sequence). `a` represents the starting value (minus one) of the consecutive sequence and must be a non-negative integer, so that a + 1 > 0. Thus, a >= 0.\",\n    \"By plugging in different values for `n`, you can see if the calculated value of `a` is a non-negative integer. If `a` meets these conditions, it implies that `num` can be expressed as the sum of `n` consecutive numbers starting from `a+1`.\",\n    \"You can stop when n*(n+1)/2 > num. At this point, any larger n will always result in a negative value for `a` because `(n+1)/2 > num/n`.\",\n    \"When `n` is odd, for `a` to be an integer, `num` has to be divisible by `n` and a must be non-negative. When `n` is even, we need to ensure `num % n == n / 2` and a must be non-negative.\",\n    \"Since the question specified that all numbers in the sequence must be positive, it means that `a + 1` must be greater than 0, which further restricts the allowable values of `n` that meet the condition. We must make sure `a >= 0` for the sum to only include positive numbers.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
