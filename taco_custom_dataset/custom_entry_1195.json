He wants to make this number as big as possible.\\n\\nMore formally, let's define $\\\\operatorname{ans}(x)$ as maximum value of $\\\\operatorname{occ}(s^{\\\\prime}, p)$ over all s' that can be obtained by removing exactly x characters from s.

We need to compute this maximum count for all possible values of `x` from 0 to `|s|`.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: A key pitfall is optimizing which characters to remove to maximize occurrences. Straightforward brute force (checking all possible combinations of removals) would likely be too slow given the constraints. Dynamic programming seems a fitting approach here.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Employ dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the maximal occurrences. The state should capture the number of characters removed so far and the current position in the string `s`. Recurrence relations will need to express the decision to either keep the current character of `s` or remove it, and update the occurence count when pattern `p` is found.\\n- Implementing Efficient Matching: The solution will require an efficient method to detect occurrences of pattern `p` as well. We can use a helper function to match `p` at current index\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can we efficiently find all occurrences of pattern `p` in a given substring `s'`?\",\n    \"What is the state of the dynamic programming solution, and what does it represent?\",\n    \"What are the possible transitions in the dynamic programming, and how do they update the number of occurrences?\",\n    \"How should we handle the case where the pattern `p` is an empty string or larger than `s`?\",\n    \"What optimizations can we implement to reduce the memory footprint of the dynamic programming table?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Efficient pattern matching can be implemented with string matching algorithms, or by simply checking if a substring of `s'` starting at a given index equals `p`.\",\n    \"The state should contain the number of characters removed (`x`) and current index in `s`. It represents the maximum number of non-overlapping pattern `p` occurrences achievable with removing `x` characters considering till current index of s.\",\n    \"At each index `i` of `s`, we can either remove `s[i]` or keep it. If we remove it, we increment `x` and move to `i+1`. If we keep it, we proceed to `i+1` but must check for `p` starting from `i`. If `p` starts at `i`, we increment the occurence count and advance by `len(p)` positions.\",\n    \"If `p` is an empty string, then any substring is an occurence. If `p` is larger than `s` then there cannot be any occurences. These cases should return appropriate 0 or length related number.\",\n    \"Since only the previous row in DP table is needed we can use rolling arrays (store only two rows at a time), drastically reducing space required.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
