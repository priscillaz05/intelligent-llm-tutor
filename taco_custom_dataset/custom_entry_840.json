"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"Given a dictionary of words where each word follows CamelCase notation, print all words (in lexicographical order) in the dictionary that match with a given pattern consisting of uppercase characters only.\\nExample: GeeksForGeeks matches the pattern \\\"GFG\\\", because if we combine all the capital letters in GeeksForGeeks they become GFG. Also note \\\"GeeksForGeeks\\\" matches with the pattern \\\"GFG\\\" and also \\\"GF\\\", but not matches with \\\"FG\\\".\\nCamelCase is the practice of writing compound words or phrases such that each word or abbreviation begins with a capital letter.

A word matches the pattern if the concatenation of its uppercase letters forms the pattern.\\n- Extracting CamelCase from Words: Iterate through each word in the dictionary and extract the uppercase letters to form a CamelCase representation of the word.\\n- Matching CamelCase with Pattern: Compare the CamelCase representation of each word with the given pattern to check for a match. It's important to ensure the CamelCase representation is at least as long as the pattern.\\n- Handling No Matches: If no words match the pattern, return -1 as specified in the problem.\\n- Returning Matched Words: If there are matching words, return them in lexicographical order.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you efficiently extract the CamelCase representation of a word?\",\n    \"What should you do if the extracted CamelCase string from a word is shorter than the given pattern?\",\n    \"How do you handle the edge case where no words in the dictionary match the given pattern?\",\n    \"What data structure is most suitable for storing and sorting the matched words?\",\n    \"How do you ensure that the matching words are returned in lexicographical order, as required by the problem statement?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Iterate through the characters of the word and append the character to a string if it's an uppercase letter. This resulting string will be the CamelCase representation.\",\n    \"If the CamelCase representation of a word is shorter than the pattern, it can't possibly match the pattern, so you should skip that word.\",\n    \"If after checking all words in the dictionary, no matches are found, return -1.\",\n    \"A list (or dynamic array) is suitable for storing the matched words, and it can be sorted later.\",\n    \"Use Python's built-in `sorted()` function or the `sort()` method on a list to sort the matched words in lexicographical order before returning them.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
