He can't choose less than K since it will be not enough to complete the order in time. On the other hand if he chooses more than K subordinates he can't control them during the operation. Help him to find the number of ways he can choose the team to complete this very important order.\\n\\n-----Input-----\\nThe first line contains a single positive integer T <= 100, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains two integers N and K, where 0 <= N, K < 2^64.

N and K are non-negative integers, and the answer will fit in a 64-bit integer. The task needs to handle multiple test cases.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Large values of N and K may lead to overflow issues if not handled carefully. The inputs N and K are bounded by 2^64, but the number of combinations is guaranteed to be less than 2^64. Efficiently calculate combinations to avoid timeouts.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Use the combination formula nCr = n! / (k! * (n-k)!). Simplify this calculation by computing (n * (n-1) * ... * (n-k+1)) / (1 * 2 * ... * k). Optimizing the computation by calculating combinations such that number of iterations is min(k, n-k).\\n- Implementation Considerations: Handling edge cases (k > n) is essential and return 0 in that case. Optimizing the combination calculation to avoid overflow by dividing at each step instead of computing the numerator and denominator completely before dividing.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the mathematical formula to calculate the number of ways to choose K items from N items?\",\n    \"How should the code handle the case where K is greater than N?\",\n    \"What data type should be used to store N, K, and the result to avoid overflow issues?\",\n    \"How can the combination calculation be optimized to avoid computing large factorials or products?\",\n    \"What is the role of T in the input and how should the code use it?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The number of ways to choose K items from N items is given by the combination formula nCr = n! / (k! * (n-k)!).\",\n    \"If K is greater than N, there are no possible combinations, so the code should return 0.\",\n    \"Since N and K can be very large (up to 2^64), use integers to store the input numbers.
