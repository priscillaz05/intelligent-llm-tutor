If no such number exists, return -1. The goal is to find the smallest possible `x`.\\n- Identifying the core logic: The smallest possible `x` can be obtained by multiplying the smallest and largest divisors in the given list.  However, it's necessary to verify that the given divisors are indeed the divisors of the computed `x` (excluding 1 and `x` itself).\\n- Handling potential edge cases: If the number of provided divisors doesn't match the actual number of divisors of the computed `x` (excluding 1 and `x`), it means no such number `x` exists that satisfies the condition, and -1 should be returned.\\n- Algorithm selection: 1. Sort the input list of divisors. 2. Calculate x as the product of the smallest and largest divisor. 3. Find all divisors of x (excluding 1 and x). 4. Compare the found divisors with the given divisors. If they are the same, return x, otherwise return -1.\\n- Implementation details: Use `long long` to prevent overflow as the divisors and `x` can be large.
