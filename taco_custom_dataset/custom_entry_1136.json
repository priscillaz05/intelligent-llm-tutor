"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"# Story\\n\\nYou and a group of friends are earning some extra money in the school holidays by re-painting the numbers on people's letterboxes for a small fee.\\n\\nSince there are 10 of you in the group each person just concentrates on painting one digit! For example, somebody will paint only the ```1```'s, somebody else will paint only the ```2```'s and so on...\\n\\nBut at the end of the day you realise not everybody did the same amount of work.\\n\\nTo avoid any fights you need to distribute the money fairly. That's where this Kata comes in.\\n\\n# Kata Task\\n\\nGiven the ```start``` and ```end``` letterbox numbers, write a method to return the frequency of all 10 digits painted.\\n\\n# Example\\n\\nFor ```start``` = 125, and ```end``` = 132\\n\\nThe letterboxes are\\n* 125 = ```1```, ```2```, ```5```\\n* 126 = ```1```, ```2```, ```6```\\n* 127 = ```1```, ```2```, ```7```\\n* 128 = ```1```, ```2```, ```8```\\n* 129 = ```1```, ```2```, ```9```\\n* 130 = ```1```, ```3```, ```0```\\n* 131 = ```1```, ```3```, ```1```\\n* 132 = ```1```, ```3```, ```2```\\n\\nThe digit frequencies are 1 x ```0```, 9 x ```1```, 6 x ```2``` etc...\\n\\nand so the method would return ```[1,9,6,3,0,1,1,1,1,1]```\\n\\n# Notes\\n\\n* 0 < ```start``` <= ```end```\\n* In C, the returned value will be free'd.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def paint_letterboxes(start, finish):\\n\\txs = [0] * 10\\n\\tfor n in range(start, finish + 1):\\n\\t\\tfor i in str(n):\\n\\t\\t\\txs[int(i)] += 1\\n\\treturn xs\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires counting the frequency of each digit (0-9) that appears in the sequence of numbers from 'start' to 'end' (inclusive).\\n- Formulating a Plan: Iterate through each number in the given range. Convert each number to a string so that each digit can be accessed. Count the occurrences of each digit and store them in an array of size 10.\\n- Identifying Edge Cases/Constraints: Consider that 'start' is always less than or equal to 'end', and both are positive integers. Therefore, there are no explicit edge cases to consider.\\n- Implementation Details: Initialize a list of 10 zeros to hold counts. Iterate from 'start' to 'end', convert to string, iterate over digits, increment count in the appropriate index in the list.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the most straightforward way to iterate through each number within the range [start, end] (inclusive)?\",\n    \"How can you access each digit of a number to count its occurrences?\",\n    \"How can you maintain the frequency count of each digit (0-9)?\",\n    \"What data structure is best suited for storing the counts of all ten digits?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"You can use a 'for' loop with the 'range' function to iterate through the numbers in the range [start, end + 1].\",\n    \"Convert the number to a string, and then iterate through the characters in the string. Each character represents a digit.\",\n    \"You can use a list or array of size 10, where the index corresponds to the digit (0-9), and the value at that index represents the count of that digit.\",\n    \"A list or array of size 10 is suitable because it allows you to directly map each digit to its corresponding count using the digit as the index.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
