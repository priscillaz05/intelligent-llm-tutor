All calculations should be performed modulo 998,244,353.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Directly enumerating all possible sequences is computationally infeasible due to the size constraints. The condition a_i != a_{i+1} and a_1 != a_N adds complexity that prevents trivial multiplication of set sizes. Overflows during intermediate calculations must be avoided by using the modulo operator.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: A dynamic programming approach can be used. Also, consider the sizes of N.  If N is small (N <= 450), an inclusion-exclusion approach is applicable. If N is large, try to identify common elements between adjacent sets and adjust the calculation.\\n- Implementing Efficient Computations: Optimize set operations. Using sets for intersection operations can be efficient. Modulo operations must be applied carefully during addition, subtraction and multiplication to prevent overflows and maintain correctness.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the key constraints that make the direct enumeration of sequences infeasible?\",\n    \"How does the modulo operation help in managing large numbers during the calculation, and where should it be applied?\",\n    \"What is the core idea behind the dynamic programming approach you will use for this problem?\",\n    \"How do you handle the condition that adjacent elements must be different, and also the first and last elements must be different?\",\n    \"What are the advantages of using set operations when finding common elements in the given sets?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The large sizes of N (up to 200,000) and the sizes of individual sets can lead to an exponential number of possible sequences, making direct enumeration too slow.\",\n    \"The modulo operation ( % 998,244,353) prevents integer overflows. It should be applied after every arithmetic operation to keep the intermediate results within manageable bounds and maintain the correctness of the final answer.\",\n    \"The dynamic programming approach involves building up the solution by considering prefixes of the sequence and tracking the number of valid sequences ending with a particular element. This helps to avoid redundant calculations.\",\n    \"To handle the condition that adjacent elements must be different, track valid sequences and avoid extending them with elements that are equal to the previous element in the sequence. For the condition on the first and last elements, we might need to calculate the possibilities where the first and last are equal and subtract from the total possibilities or consider cases separately where the first and last are equal and where they are not.\",\n    \"Using set operations, especially the intersection, allows for fast determination of common elements between adjacent sets.  These elements cause further restrictions on the number of valid sequences. This optimization contributes to the efficiency of the algorithm, especially when the number of sequences is large.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
