The abbreviation consists of the first character of 's', the number of characters between the first and the last character, and the last character of 's'.\\n- Edge Cases and Constraints: The string length is at least 3 and at most 100. The string contains only lowercase English letters. No specific edge cases other than input constraints need to be considered.\\n- Algorithm Selection: Extract the first character and the last character of the string. Calculate the number of characters between the first and last characters, which is the string length minus 2. Concatenate the first character, the calculated number (converted to a string), and the last character.\\n- Implementation Details: Read the input string 's'. Calculate its length. Extract the first and last characters. Calculate the middle count. Construct the abbreviation string by concatenating the first character, the string representation of the middle count, and the last character. Print the abbreviation.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the abbreviation format required for the given string?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the number of characters between the first and last characters?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases to consider, and how do they affect the solution?\",\n    \"How would you handle the concatenation of the first character, the count, and the last character to form the abbreviation?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The abbreviation format is: first character + number of characters between the first and last + last character.\",\n    \"The number of characters between the first and last character is the length of the string minus 2.\",\n    \"The string must have a length between 3 and 100, and it should contain only lowercase English letters.
