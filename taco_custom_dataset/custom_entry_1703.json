An island is a group of connected 1s (horizontally or vertically). Two islands are distinct if they are not equal (not rotated or reflected).\\n- Identifying Key Challenges: The main challenge is to identify and differentiate distinct islands. This requires traversing each island and storing its shape in a way that allows comparison with other islands. The islands have to be normalized to account for different starting positions. Using a string representation of relative coordinates from the starting point allows direct comparison using a set.\\n- Choosing an Algorithmic Approach:  Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore each island. During the DFS traversal, record the relative coordinates of each cell in the island with respect to the starting cell. Store each island's shape as a string in a set. The size of the set will give the number of distinct islands.\\n- Implementation Details: Maintain a visited array to keep track of visited cells. For each unvisited cell containing a 1, start a DFS. Within the DFS function, add the relative coordinates to a list. After completing the DFS, convert the list to a string and add it to a set. The use of relative coordinates ensures that islands with the same shape, regardless of their position, are considered the same.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for two islands to be distinct in this context, and how does that impact the chosen approach?\",\n    \"Why is it important to use relative coordinates instead of absolute coordinates when identifying distinct islands?\",\n    \"How does the set data structure help in efficiently counting distinct islands?\",\n    \"What role does the visited array play in preventing infinite loops during the DFS traversal?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases or boundary conditions that need to be considered while implementing the DFS traversal?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Two islands are distinct if their shapes are different, even if they are located in different parts of the grid. This requires a method to normalize the island's shape, such as using relative coordinates from the starting point.\",\n    \"Using relative coordinates ensures that islands with the same shape are considered the same, regardless of their position in the grid. Absolute coordinates would differentiate islands based on their location, even if they had the same shape.\",\n    \"The set data structure ensures that only unique island shapes are counted. When a new island shape is encountered, it's added to the set. If the same shape is encountered again, the set ignores it, thus ensuring that the count represents only distinct islands.\",\n    \"The visited array prevents the DFS traversal from revisiting cells that have already been explored, thus avoiding infinite loops and ensuring that each cell is processed only once.\",\n    \"Edge cases include out-of-bounds indices, handling empty grids, and ensuring proper handling of connected components that extend to the edges of the grid. Boundary checks within the DFS are important to prevent errors and ensure the algorithm functions correctly.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
