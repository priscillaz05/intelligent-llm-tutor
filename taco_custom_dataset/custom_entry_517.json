Chef recently learnt about a new form of sorting, endsort! \\n\\nWhile performing endsort of an array $A$ of $N$ distinct elements, Chef can move any element to the end of the array. \\n\\nHowever, Chef fears that this will take too much time. Help Chef find the number of moves to sort the given array in ascending order using endsort!\\n\\n------ Input: ------\\n\\nThe first line contains a single integer $T$, the number of test cases. \\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$, the number of elements of given array $A$. \\nThe next line would contain $N$ space separated integers, the elements of the array. \\n\\n------ Output: ------\\n\\nPrint a single integer, the minimum number of moves to sort the array in ascending order using endsort.\\n\\n------ Constraints  ------\\n$1 \u2264 T \u2264 10$\\n$1 \u2264 N \u2264 100000$\\n$1 \u2264 A_{i} \u2264 10^{9}$\\n\\n----- Sample Input 1 ------ \\n2\\n5\\n1 2 3 4 5\\n5\\n1 3 2 5 4\\n----- Sample Output 1 ------ \\n0\\n3\\n----- explanation 1 ------ \\nFor the second sample, in the first move, we move 3 to the end of the array.

Iterate through the original array and increment a counter when the element is the same as the element at the current index in the sorted array. The final answer is the length of array - counter.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Use efficient data structures and built in sorting to avoid time-outs during coding.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is \\\"endsort\\\" and how does it affect the sorting process?\",\n    \"How do you find the minimum number of moves efficiently?\",\n    \"What is the time complexity of your proposed algorithm and how does it relate to the problem constraints?\",\n    \"What edge cases should I consider?\",\n    \"Why can't we just sort the array by repeatedly moving the smallest unsorted element to the end?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Endsort is a specific type of sorting where any element can be moved to the end of the array in each step.\",\n    \"Find the longest prefix of the given array that is already sorted and subtract the length of this prefix from the total number of elements in the array.\",\n    \"The complexity should be O(n log n) because of the sorting. Since the constraint is n <= 100000 this should be fast enough.\",\n    \"Edge cases include already sorted arrays which requires 0 moves and arrays sorted in descending order, requiring n-1 moves.\",\n    \"We can, but it might not be the minimum. Consider the case where an element is in its sorted position, but it may have to be moved to make space for a smaller element from later in the array.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
