More formally, for each $k = 1,2,\\\\ldots, n$ it should hold that $$a_1 + a_2 + \\\\cdots + a_k \\\\geq a_1 + a_2 + \\\\cdots + a_m.$$\\n\\nPlease note that multiple smallest prefix sums may exist and that it is only required that $a_1 + a_2 + \\\\cdots + a_m$ is one of them.\\n\\nHelp Baltic find the minimum number of operations required to make $a_1 + a_2 + \\\\cdots + a_m$ the least of all prefix sums. It can be shown that a valid sequence of operations always exists.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

Thus $a_1 + a_2 + a_3=-6$ is the smallest of all prefix sums.\\n\\nIn the second example, we perform the operation $a_3 := -a_3$.

Let's consider each part separately to determine the sign flips needed.\\n- Devise Strategy: We will calculate prefix sums for both array segments. If a prefix sum becomes less than the prefix sum at index m, we will need to flip the sign of one or more numbers to increase that prefix sum. A heap can be used to efficiently find the minimum number to flip the sign of. We apply this logic to the left and the right portions of the array separately to minimize operations.\\n- Implementation Details: Notice that in the left portion of the array (from index 0 to m-1), we will process the array backwards (from m-1 to 0). We essentially want to ensure that prefixes ending at indices from 0 to m-1 are *not* less than the prefix ending at m-1.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for $a_1 + a_2 + \\\\cdots + a_m$ to be the smallest of all non-empty prefix sums?\",\n    \"How would you approach ensuring that the prefix sum $a_1 + a_2 + \\\\cdots + a_m$ is the smallest among all prefix sums, given the ability to negate elements?\",\n    \"How can a heap data structure be used to optimize the process of determining which elements to negate to increase a prefix sum that is smaller than the target prefix sum $a_1 + a_2 + \\\\cdots + a_m$?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases to consider when implementing the solution?\",\n    \"Why do we need to consider the array prefixes to the left and right of $m$ separately?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"It means that for any k from 1 to n, the sum of the first k elements ($a_1 + a_2 + \\\\cdots + a_k$) is greater than or equal to the sum of the first m elements ($a_1 + a_2 + \\\\cdots + a_m$).\",\n    \"I would calculate prefix sums and check if any prefix sum is less than the prefix sum at index m.

By using a heap, we can quickly identify the element whose negation will result in the greatest increase to the prefix sum, helping to minimize the number of negations needed.\",\n    \"Consider when the array is empty, when m is 1, or when the initial prefix sum $a_1 + a_2 + \\\\cdots + a_m$ is already the smallest. Also, need to handle potentially large numbers to avoid overflow.\",\n    \"The prefix sums on both sides of $m$ contribute to whether the prefix sum up to $m$ is the smallest. The portion of the array from $m$ to $n-1$ directly affects prefix sums beyond index $m$. From index $0$ to $m-1$, we work backwards because the sum $a_1 + ... + a_{m-1}$ must be greater or equal to $a_1 + ... + a_m$. Similarly, $a_1 + ... + a_{m-2}$ must be greater than or equal to  $a_1 + ... + a_m$, and so on. Therefore, manipulating each part independently ensures the condition holds for all prefix sums.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
