Roads can be traversed either way. He wants those roads to be constructed in such a way that it is possible to go from each city to any other city by traversing at most two roads. You are also given m pairs of cities \u2014 roads cannot be constructed between these pairs of cities.\\n\\nYour task is to construct the minimum number of roads that still satisfy the above conditions. The constraints will guarantee that this is always possible.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line consists of two integers n and m $(1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^{3}, 0 \\\\leq m < \\\\frac{n}{2})$.\\n\\nThen m lines follow, each consisting of two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 \u2264 a_{i}, b_{i} \u2264 n, a_{i} \u2260 b_{i}), which means that it is not possible to construct a road connecting cities a_{i} and b_{i}. Consider the cities are numbered from 1 to n.\\n\\nIt is guaranteed that every pair of cities will appear at most once in the input.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nYou should print an integer s: the minimum number of roads that should be constructed, in the first line. Then s lines should follow, each consisting of two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 \u2264 a_{i}, b_{i} \u2264 n, a_{i} \u2260 b_{i}), which means that a road should be constructed between cities a_{i} and b_{i}.\\n\\nIf there are several solutions, you may print any of them.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n4 1\\n1 3\\n\\nOutput\\n3\\n1 2\\n4 2\\n2 3\\n\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nThis is one possible solution of the example:  [Image] \\n\\nThese are examples of wrong solutions: [Image]  The above solution is wrong because it doesn't use the minimum number of edges (4 vs 3). In addition, it also tries to construct a road between cities 1 and 3, while the input specifies that it is not allowed to construct a road between the pair. [Image]  The above solution is wrong because you need to traverse at least 3 roads to go from city 1 to city 3, whereas in your country it must be possible to go from any city to another by traversing at most 2 roads. [Image]  Finally, the above solution is wrong because it must be possible to go from any city to another, whereas it is not possible in this country to go from city 1 to 3, 2 to 3, and 4 to 3.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"ROADS = 0\\n\\ndef find_center_citie(condition, num_of_citie):\\n\\tres = []\\n\\tfor i in range(number_of_city):\\n\\t\\tcount = [j for j in condition if j[0] == i + 1 or j[1] == i + 1]\\n\\t\\tres.append(len(count))\\n\\tcenter = res.index(min(res)) + 1\\n\\treturn center\\n\\ndef acess(i, j, cities):\\n\\tcitie_1 = i + 1\\n\\tcitie_2 = j + 1\\n\\tif cities[i].count(citie_2) == 1:\\n\\t\\treturn True\\n\\tfor c in cities[i]:\\n\\t\\tfor c2 in cities[c - 1]:\\n\\t\\t\\tif c2 == citie_2:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn True\\n\\treturn False\\n\\ndef print_road(cities):\\n\\tfor c2 in cities:\\n\\t\\tprint(c2[0], c2[1])\\n\\ndef finnesh(cities, num_of_citie):\\n\\tfor i in range(number_of_city):\\n\\t\\tfor j in range(i + 1, number_of_city):\\n\\t\\t\\tif acess(i, j, cities) == False:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn False\\n\\treturn True\\ncondition = []\\npath_lst = []\\nline = [int(i) for i in input().split()]\\nnumber_of_city = line[0]\\nnumber_of_codition = line[1]\\nfor i in range(number_of_codition):\\n\\tcitie = [int(i) for i in input().split()]\\n\\tcondition.append([citie[0], citie[1]])\\ncities = [[] for _ in range(number_of_city)]\\ncenter = find_center_citie(condition, number_of_city)\\nfor i in range(number_of_city):\\n\\tif i != center - 1 and condition.count([center, i + 1]) == 0 and (condition.count([i + 1, center]) == 0):\\n\\t\\tcities[center - 1].append(i + 1)\\n\\t\\tpath_lst.append([center, i + 1])\\n\\t\\tcities[i].append(center)\\n\\t\\tROADS += 1\\nif len(cities[center - 1]) != number_of_city - 1:\\n\\tfor i in range(number_of_city):\\n\\t\\tfor j in range(i + 1, number_of_city):\\n\\t\\t\\tif acess(i, j, cities) == False:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif condition.count([j + 1, i + 1]) == 0 and condition.count([i + 1, j + 1]) == 0:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcities[i].append(j + 1)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcities[j].append(i + 1)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpath_lst.append([i + 1, j + 1])\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfor k in cities[i]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tif cities[k - 1].count(j + 1) == 0 and condition.count([j + 1, k]) == 0 and (condition.count([k, j + 1]) == 0):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcities[k - 1].append(j + 1)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcities[j].append(k)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpath_lst.append([j + 1, k])\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tROADS += 1\\nprint(ROADS)\\nprint_road(path_lst)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the problem: The problem requires finding the minimum number of roads to connect n cities such that any two cities are reachable within at most two hops. There are also constraints on which roads cannot be built.\\n- Identifying the core strategy: The most efficient way to ensure connectivity within two hops is to build a star-like structure centered around one city. All other cities should ideally be directly connected to this central city.\\n- Handling Constraints: Prioritize connecting all cities to the central city unless explicitly forbidden by the input constraints. In the event that a direct connection to the central city is forbidden, find an alternative path of length two via another city connected to the central city.\\n- Optimizing for Minimum Roads: The goal is to minimize the number of roads. After the star like structure is established, any remaining cities that cannot reach each other within two hops must be connected directly, unless restricted. If a direct connection is restricted, then two hops must be used. This is repeated until any two cities are connected either directly or indirectly within two hops.\\n- Constructing the center city:  The best center is the one with the least number of restricted edges.\\n\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the underlying structure that minimizes roads while ensuring any two cities are reachable in at most two hops?\",\n    \"How can the provided constraints be incorporated when building the connections?\",\n    \"What strategy can be used to select the best city to be the center of the road network?\",\n    \"How to deal with the situation that there is no direct road possible between the center city and other cities?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The core structure is a star-like network where a central city is directly connected to as many other cities as possible.\",\n    \"First attempt to connect the central city to all other cities while avoiding disallowed connections.
