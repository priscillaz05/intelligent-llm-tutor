The indices i and j must satisfy 1 <= i < j <= N.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: The constraint on the size of N (up to 10^5) implies that an O(N^2) solution might be too slow for the second subtask. The range of A[i] (up to 10^6) needs to be considered when generating prime numbers. Need to avoid double counting pairs.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: A brute-force approach iterating through all pairs and checking the XOR sum against precomputed primes is feasible for smaller N. For larger N, optimization is needed. Consider using dynamic programming or frequency counting to reduce computational complexity.\\n- Implementing Prime Number Generation: Create a function that efficiently identifies prime numbers up to a certain limit, or use a sieve method.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for two prime numbers to have the same parity, and how does that constraint influence the valid XOR sums?\",\n    \"Given the size constraints of N (up to 10^5) and A[i] (up to 10^6), what time complexity should the algorithm aim for to pass all test cases?\",\n    \"If a brute-force approach (checking every pair) is too slow, can you think of alternative methods to efficiently count the number of valid pairs?\",\n    \"How can frequency counting or hashmaps be used to store and retrieve information that reduces computational complexity, specifically concerning XOR values and parity?\",\n    \"What optimizations can be applied to prime number generation and parity checking to ensure that the entire process is time-efficient?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Two prime numbers have the same parity if they are both odd or both even.
