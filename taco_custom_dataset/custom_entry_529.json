Each year the competition receives an abbreviation of form IAO'y, where y stands for some number of consequent last digits of the current year. Organizers always pick an abbreviation with non-empty string y that has never been used before. Among all such valid abbreviations they choose the shortest one and announce it to be the abbreviation of this year's competition.\\n\\nFor example, the first three Olympiads (years 1989, 1990 and 1991, respectively) received the abbreviations IAO'9, IAO'0 and IAO'1, while the competition in 2015 received an abbreviation IAO'15, as IAO'5 has been already used in 1995.\\n\\nYou are given a list of abbreviations.

The task is to determine the year corresponding to a given abbreviation.\\n- Identifying the Core Logic: The key idea is to reconstruct the year from the given abbreviation suffix. Since the abbreviations are chosen to be the shortest and unique, we can iterate through possible prefixes to form valid years (>= 1989) and check if they have been used before.\\n- Handling Edge Cases and Constraints: Need to handle the base years 1989-1998 specially as abbreviations of single digit years are allowed for those years. Also, need to consider cases where the given abbreviation represents a year with prefix digits. The number of digits in the abbreviation suffix affects the range of possible years.\\n- Choosing an Appropriate Data Structure/Algorithm: A dictionary or hashmap could be useful to store pre-computed year suffixes with corresponding years. A recursive or iterative approach may be needed to determine the correct year by trying different prefixes and ensuring uniqueness.\\n- Algorithm Implementation Details: The main logic would involve finding potential years based on the abbreviation and ensuring they're not already used from previous years. This involves iterating through the possibilities and then verifying that any shortened versions of that year weren't already used. The ground truth uses a somewhat unintuitive recursion with lookups, but this is a possible implementation approach.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you determine the possible range of years an abbreviation could refer to, based on the length and digits of the abbreviation suffix?\",\n    \"What is the significance of the IAO starting in 1989, and how does this constraint affect the possible reconstructed years from the abbreviation?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently check if an abbreviation suffix (or a shortened version) has already been used in a previous year to ensure uniqueness?\",\n    \"Given the abbreviation IAO'y, how would you approach reconstructing the full year by adding prefixes, ensuring it's a valid year (>=1989), and that there are no conflicts with shorter used abbreviations?\",\n    \"How does the solution handle single-digit abbreviations, specifically for the years 1989 through 1998?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The length of the abbreviation suffix determines how many digits of the year are provided. The digits themselves constrain the last part of the year. For example, IAO'15 means the year ends in 15. We then need to consider prefixes to make a full valid year.\",\n    \"The IAO starting in 1989 is crucial because it establishes the earliest possible year that needs to be considered. Any reconstructed year must be >= 1989. Also abbreviations for 1989 to 1998 could be of single digit length.\",\n    \"One way to check uniqueness is to keep track of all used abbreviations in a set or hash table. Before assigning a year, check if the abbreviation, or any shorter suffix of it, is already present in the used set.\",\n    \"I would start with the abbreviation suffix. Then, I would iteratively add prefix digits to form potential years (starting with 1, then 2, etc.) as strings. Check if the resulting year is valid (>= 1989). Convert the potential year to an integer and check its shorter suffix against previous years. Stop and assign the reconstructed year to the given abbreviation once a valid and unique year is formed.\",\n    \"The solution must handle single-digit abbreviations by checking specifically for the years 1989 through 1998 and assigning the abbreviations '9' through '8' accordingly, before considering any multi-digit abbreviations. This constraint can be handled by using a hashmap for single digit years.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
