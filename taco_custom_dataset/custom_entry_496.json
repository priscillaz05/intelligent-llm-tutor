"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"John wants to decorate a room with wallpaper. He's heard that \\nmaking sure he has the right amount of wallpaper is more complex than it sounds. \\nHe wants a fool-proof method for getting it right.\\n\\nJohn knows that the rectangular room has a length of `l` meters, a width of `w` meters, a height of `h` meters.\\nThe standard width of the rolls he wants to buy is `52` centimeters. The \\nlength of a roll is `10` meters.\\nHe bears in mind however, that it\u2019s best to have an extra length of wallpaper handy in case of mistakes or miscalculations so he wants to buy a length `15%` greater than the one he needs.\\n\\nLast time he did these calculations he got a headache, so could you help John? Your function `wallpaper(l, w, h)` should return as a plain English word\\nin lower case the number of rolls he must buy.\\n\\n### Example:\\n\\n`wallpaper(4.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return \\\"ten\\\"`\\n\\n`wallpaper(0.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return \\\"zero\\\"`\\n\\n# Notes:\\n- all rolls (even with incomplete width) are put edge to edge \\n- 0 <= l, w, h (floating numbers), it can happens that `w x h x l` is zero\\n- the integer `r` (number of rolls) will always be less or equal to 20\\n\\n\\n- FORTH: the number of rolls will be a *positive or null integer* (not a plain English word; this number can be greater than 20)\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"from math import ceil\\nnumbers = {0: 'zero', 1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three', 4: 'four', 5: 'five', 6: 'six', 7: 'seven', 8: 'eight', 9: 'nine', 10: 'ten', 11: 'eleven', 12: 'twelve', 13: 'thirteen', 14: 'fourteen', 15: 'fifteen', 16: 'sixteen', 17: 'seventeen', 18: 'eighteen', 19: 'nineteen', 20: 'twenty'}\\n\\ndef wallpaper(l, w, h):\\n\\treturn 'zero' if w * l == 0 else numbers[ceil((2 * l + 2 * w) * h * 1.15 / 5.2)]\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem asks to calculate the number of wallpaper rolls needed to cover a room, accounting for extra length and converting the result to a word.\\n- Defining Key Variables and Units: Identify the room's dimensions (l, w, h in meters), wallpaper roll dimensions (52 cm width, 10 m length), and the extra 15% wallpaper needed.\\n- Edge Cases: Address the edge case where any of the room's dimensions (l, w, or h) is zero, which implies zero surface area to cover (resulting in zero rolls needed).\\n- Calculating the Surface Area: Determine the formula for the room's surface area to be covered, considering it is a rectangular room (2 * (l + w) * h).\\n- Incorporating Extra Wallpaper: Add 15% to the required surface area to account for wastage (multiply by 1.15).\\n- Calculating Rolls Needed: Divide the total surface area by the area covered by one roll of wallpaper.  Convert the roll width from cm to meters (52 cm = 0.52 m), and then calculate area of each roll as 0.52 * 10 = 5.2 square meters.  Ceil the final number because you can't buy parts of rolls.\\n- Converting to English Word: Use a dictionary to convert the number of rolls to its corresponding English word.\\n- Ensuring All Conditions: Consider that w * l == 0 should return zero, not w*h or l*h.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the key dimensions to consider for the room and the wallpaper rolls, and in what units are they measured?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: The room dimensions are length (l), width (w), and height (h) in meters. The wallpaper roll dimensions are width (52 cm, which needs conversion to meters) and length (10 meters).\",\n    \"How do you calculate the total surface area of the room that needs to be covered with wallpaper?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: The total surface area is calculated as 2 * (l + w) * h, representing the perimeter times the height of the room.\",\n    \"How do you account for the extra 15% of wallpaper needed for wastage and miscalculations?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: The calculated surface area is multiplied by 1.15 to account for the additional 15% of wallpaper needed.\",\n    \"What is the area covered by one wallpaper roll, considering its dimensions?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: Each roll covers 5.2 square meters. This is calculated by converting 52cm into meters (.52 meters) and multiplying by the length of the roll which is 10 meters.\",\n    \"How do you handle the edge case where one or more of the room dimensions are zero?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: If any of l, w, or h is zero, then the surface area to be covered is zero (or w * l is zero), and the function should return 'zero'.\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The room dimensions are length (l), width (w), and height (h) in meters.
