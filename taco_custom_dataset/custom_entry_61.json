The score is calculated by summing the number of extra vowels (vowels repeated more than once consecutively) and dividing by the number of vowel groups.\\n- Identifying Vowels: The vowels considered are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' (case-insensitive). The letter 'y' is explicitly excluded.\\n- Calculating Extra Vowels:  For each group of repeated vowels, the number of extra vowels is the length of the repetition minus 1.  For example, 'EEEEE' has 4 extra 'E's.\\n- Calculating Total Vowel Groups: This involves identifying each sequence of repeated vowels.\\n- Calculating the Trump Score: Sum the count of extra vowels from each repeated group, and divide by the total count of such groups. Finally, round the result to two decimal places.\\n- Edge Cases: The problem statement ensures that there will always be at least one vowel, so an empty string or a string with no vowels is not an edge case to consider. Also, it says the result should be rounded to two decimal digits.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you identify vowel sequences and count the number of consecutive repetitions for each vowel?\",\n    \"How should the case of the vowels be handled? Are 'a' and 'A' treated differently, or should case be ignored?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the number of extra vowels for each sequence, and then sum these values across all identified sequences?\",\n    \"How should the final \\\"Trump score\\\" be calculated after summing the extra vowels and identifying vowel groups?\",\n    \"What is the formula for calculating the Trump score?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Use a regular expression or iterative approach to identify consecutive sequences of vowels. Regular expressions are better\",\n    \"Case should be ignored so both lower case and upper case vowels are considered equal.\",\n    \"For each sequence, subtract 1 from the length of the sequence. Sum these 'extra' vowel counts for all sequences.\",\n    \"Divide the total count of extra vowels by the total number of vowel groups.\",\n    \"Trump Score = round(sum(extra vowels) / number of vowel groups, 2)\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
