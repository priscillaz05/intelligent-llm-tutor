"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"Write a method that will search an array of strings for all strings that contain another string, ignoring capitalization. Then return an array of the found strings. \\n\\nThe method takes two parameters, the query string and the array of strings to search, and returns an array. \\n\\nIf the string isn't contained in any of the strings in the array, the method returns an array containing a single string: \\\"Empty\\\" (or `Nothing` in Haskell, or \\\"None\\\" in Python and C)\\n\\n### Examples\\nIf the string to search for is \\\"me\\\", and the array to search is [\\\"home\\\", \\\"milk\\\", \\\"Mercury\\\", \\\"fish\\\"], the method should return [\\\"home\\\", \\\"Mercury\\\"].\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def word_search(query, seq):\\n\\treturn [x for x in seq if query.lower() in x.lower()] or ['None']\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understand the problem: The goal is to find strings within an array that contain a given query string, ignoring case.\\n- Account for edge cases: When no matching strings are found, the function must return an array containing only the string \\\"None\\\".\\n- Choose a suitable approach: Use a list comprehension to iterate through the array and check if the lowercase version of the query string is a substring of the lowercase version of each string in the array.\\n- Handle the 'no match' case: If the list comprehension returns an empty list (i.e., no matches found), use the `or` operator to return a list containing the string 'None'.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How should the search be conducted to ignore capitalization?\",\n    \"What should be returned if no strings in the array contain the query string?\",\n    \"What kind of data structure would be best for storing the results during the search?\",\n    \"How can the search be made efficient, especially for large arrays?\",\n    \"Are there any specific Python features that can simplify this search operation?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The search should convert both the query string and each string in the array to lowercase before comparison.\",\n    \"If no strings contain the query string, a list containing the single string 'None' should be returned.\",\n    \"A list is appropriate for storing the matching strings.\",\n    \"For large arrays, using techniques like indexing or hash tables might improve search performance, but for the given problem constraints, a simple linear search with a list comprehension is generally sufficient.\",\n    \"Python's list comprehensions and the `in` operator make this task very concise and efficient.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
