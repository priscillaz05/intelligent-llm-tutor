We need to determine the exponents of the prime factors for each number. A number is a perfect $k$-th power if all exponents in its prime factorization are multiples of $k$.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: Iterate through all possible pairs $(i, j)$ where $i < j$. For each pair, compute the product $a_i \\\\cdot a_j$. Find the prime factorization of $a_i$ and $a_j$. Sum the exponents of the prime factors. If all resulting exponents are divisible by $k$, then the product is a perfect $k$-th power, and we increment the count.\\n- Optimizations: We can precompute prime factorizations. Instead of calculating the product directly and then factorizing, we can factorize $a_i$ and $a_j$ independently and then combine the exponents.\\n- Data Structures: Use a dictionary/hashmap to store the counts of \\\"exponent signatures\\\", which uniquely identify a number's factors needed to make a kth power.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can prime factorization help determine if a number is a perfect $k$-th power?\",\n    \"What optimizations can be made to avoid redundant calculations, especially when dealing with large arrays?\",\n    \"What data structures are suitable for efficiently storing and retrieving prime factorizations or exponent signatures?\",\n    \"How do you handle edge cases, such as when one or both numbers in a pair are 1?\",\n    \"If $k$ is large, how might that affect the efficiency of your algorithm and what adjustments can you make?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A number is a perfect $k$-th power if all the exponents in its prime factorization are multiples of $k$. For example, if $k = 3$ and the prime factorization is $2^3 \\\\cdot 3^6$, then the number is a perfect cube.\",\n    \"We can precompute prime factorizations for all numbers in the array and store them in a hashmap. When checking pairs, we can retrieve the precomputed factorizations and combine them, which avoids repeatedly factorizing the same numbers.\",\n    \"A dictionary or hashmap is suitable. The keys can be the numbers themselves or a tuple representing the exponents of the prime factors, and the values can be the corresponding prime factors or exponents.\",\n    \"If a number is 1, its prime factorization is empty, so its exponents are all 0. If $a_i = 1$, then $a_i \\\\cdot a_j = a_j$, so we only need to check if $a_j$ is a perfect $k$-th power. If both are 1, their product is 1, which is always a perfect $k$-th power.\",\n    \"If $k$ is very large, the computation of $x^k$ might lead to overflow issues. If $k$ is large and the numbers are also large, we should be cautious with memory usage in prime factorization and exponent calculations.
