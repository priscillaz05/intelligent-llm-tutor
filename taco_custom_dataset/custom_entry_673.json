Store these in a list or set for fast lookup.\\n- Handling Constraints: Consider the constraint that $1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^{10}$. The program must generate Fibonacci numbers up to this limit.\\n- Optimizing for Multiple Test Cases: Since there are multiple test cases, pre-calculating and storing Fibonacci numbers can significantly improve efficiency.\\n- Performing Lookup: For each test case, check if N exists in the generated Fibonacci sequence. Return 'IsFibo' if it exists, and 'IsNotFibo' otherwise.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the maximum possible value of N efficiently?\",\n    \"What data structure should be used to store the Fibonacci numbers for optimal lookup?\",\n    \"How can you handle the multiple test cases to improve overall efficiency?\",\n    \"What are the implications of using Python's stdin.readline() vs input() for reading the input, given the size constraints?\",\n    \"How can you test your code to ensure its correctness, especially given the constraint $1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^{10}$?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Generate Fibonacci numbers iteratively, starting from 0 and 1, and appending the sum of the last two numbers until the last generated number exceeds $10^{10}$.\",\n    \"Use a set for storing Fibonacci numbers to allow for O(1) lookup time when checking if N is a Fibonacci number.\",\n    \"Pre-calculate the Fibonacci numbers only once at the beginning of the program, and reuse them for each test case. This avoids redundant calculations.\",\n    \"stdin.readline() is generally faster than input() for reading input, especially with a large number of inputs, as input() also evaluates the input which is not needed here. Using stdin.readline() will improve efficiency.\",\n    \"Test cases should include the lower and upper bounds of N, as well as known Fibonacci and non-Fibonacci numbers within the range.
