The graph is not guaranteed to be connected. Each road has it's own parameter w. You can travel through the roads, but the government made a new law: you can only go through two roads at a time (go from city a to city b and then from city b to city c) and you will have to pay (w_{ab} + w_{bc})^2 money to go through those roads. Find out whether it is possible to travel from city 1 to every other city t and what's the minimum amount of money you need to get from 1 to t.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nFirst line contains two integers n, m (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 min((n \u22c5 (n - 1))/(2), 2 \u22c5 10^5)).\\n\\nNext m lines each contain three integers v_i, u_i, w_i (1 \u2264 v_i, u_i \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 w_i \u2264 50, u_i \u2260 v_i). It's guaranteed that there are no multiple edges, i.e. for any edge (u_i, v_i) there are no other edges (u_i, v_i) or (v_i, u_i).\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nFor every city t print one integer.

The main challenge is to adapt Dijkstra's to the constraint of traveling two roads at a time. This requires considering pairs of connected edges.\\n- Implementation Details: The graph can be represented using an adjacency list. Dijkstra's algorithm requires a priority queue (heap) to efficiently find the next city to visit. The cost function is (w1 + w2)^2 for two consecutive edges with weights w1 and w2. Initialize distances to infinity, set the distance to city 1 to 0, and use Dijkstra's to update the distances to other cities. If a city is unreachable, set its distance to -1.\\n- Edge Cases: The graph might not be connected. If a city is unreachable from city 1, the output should be -1 for that city. Integer overflow should be avoided by using appropriate data types.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can we efficiently represent the graph structure for this problem, considering the large number of cities and roads?\",\n    \"How can we adapt Dijkstra's algorithm to handle the constraint that we must travel two roads at a time?\",\n    \"What data structures are necessary to implement Dijkstra's algorithm efficiently for this problem?\",\n    \"How should we handle the case where a city is not reachable from city 1?\",\n    \"What is the computational complexity of the proposed solution, considering the number of cities and roads?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"An adjacency list is an efficient way to represent the graph. Each city can be a key in a dictionary, and its value is a list of tuples representing its neighbors and the corresponding edge weights.\",\n    \"We can modify Dijkstra's algorithm to consider pairs of connected edges. When visiting a city, we iterate through all its neighbors. For each neighbor, we then iterate through that neighbor's neighbors to calculate the cost of traversing the two edges and update the distance to the final city in the pair.\",\n    \"We need a priority queue (heap) to efficiently select the city with the minimum distance. We also need an array to store the distances from the starting city to all other cities.\",\n    \"During the Dijkstra's algorithm, if a city's distance remains infinity after the algorithm completes, it means the city is not reachable from city 1. In this case, we should set the distance to -1 for that city.\",\n    \"The computational complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm using a priority queue is O(E log V), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices (cities). In this case, the complexity would be O(m log n) where m is the number of roads and n is the number of cities. The adaptation of the algorithm to consider pairs of edges may increase the constant factor in the complexity, but the overall complexity remains O(m log n).\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
