The resulting number must be a positive integer, which means it cannot have leading zeroes.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls:  The main pitfall is the leading zero constraint.  If the first digit of the result is zero, then we must make sure it's not the leading digit.  Also, the number of digits to remove $k$ can be zero.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy:  The goal is to greedily build the result from left to right. To minimize the number, at each position we look for the smallest digit within the next $k+1$ digits.  This guarantees we use the opportunity to remove k digits.  We also have to be careful when to remove the first few digits which might be zero, after finding the smallest nonzero.\\n- Implementation Considerations: When constructing the minimum number, maintain a string or a list of characters. Iterate through the original number and decide which digits to keep and which to remove based on the greedy strategy and the value of $k$. If we have zero available removals after constructing the result it needs to append other digits from the original input, if it has any.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you ensure that the resulting number doesn't have leading zeroes while still being positive?\",\n    \"How can you effectively reduce a number by removing $k$ digits such that the resulting number is the smallest possible?\",\n    \"If the current greedy algorithm results in an incomplete number (less than $|x| - k$ digits), what do you do?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases for $k=0$ and how do you handle them?\",\n    \"What strategy could you use to handle the edge case when the number 'x' is smaller or greater than number 'k' to make sure you will not generate errors while running?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"We should pick the smallest non-zero digit in the range of the next $k+1$ digits as the starting digit, and adjust $k$ accordingly. If there are no remaining digits we return `1`.\",\n    \"A greedy strategy of picking the smallest available digit at each position within the range of $k+1$ digits ahead to ensure the smallest leftmost digits.\",\n    \"If there is any $k$ left, we reduce digits from the end to guarantee the minumun number.\",\n    \"If $k = 0$, we just return the initial number.\",\n    \"Before starting the algorithm, check that the value k is not negative or greater than the length of the number 'x'.
