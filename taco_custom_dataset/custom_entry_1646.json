The i-th box can hold at most xi boxes on its top (we'll call xi the strength of the box). \\n\\nSince all the boxes have the same size, Ciel cannot put more than one box directly on the top of some box. For example, imagine Ciel has three boxes: the first has strength 2, the second has strength 1 and the third has strength 1. She cannot put the second and the third box simultaneously directly on the top of the first one. But she can put the second box directly on the top of the first one, and then the third box directly on the top of the second one. We will call such a construction of boxes a pile.\\n\\n<image>\\n\\nFox Ciel wants to construct piles from all the boxes.

A box cannot have more boxes on top of it than its strength allows.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints: Each box can only have one box directly on top of it. The objective is to minimize the number of piles.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Since we want to minimize the number of piles, we should try to put as many boxes as possible into each pile. Sorting the boxes by their strength in descending order might help us to efficiently allocate boxes to piles. Binary search can be used to find the minimum number of piles.\\n- Implementing the Solution: Sort the strengths in descending order. Use a function `possible(s)` that checks if it's possible to construct piles with `s` piles. Binary search on the possible number of piles from 1 to n to find the minimum number of piles required.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does sorting the strengths of the boxes help to solve the problem?\",\n    \"How does the `possible(s)` function determine if it is possible to construct 's' number of piles?\",\n    \"What is the purpose of using binary search in this problem and what range are we searching within?\",\n    \"Can you explain the logic behind updating the `last` dictionary within the `possible(s)` function?\",\n    \"How does the code handle the constraint that each box can only have one box directly on top of it?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Sorting the strengths in descending order helps prioritize boxes with higher strength to be used as the base of the pile, making it easier to fill the piles as much as possible.\",\n    \"The `possible(s)` function iterates through the sorted strengths, simulating the process of building 's' piles. It checks if each box can be placed on top of the current boxes in each pile without exceeding their strengths. If any pile becomes impossible to build further, it returns `False`.\",\n    \"Binary search is used to efficiently find the minimum number of piles needed. It searches within the range of 1 to n (inclusive), where n is the total number of boxes. For each 'mid' value (potential number of piles), the `possible(mid)` function is called to check if it is feasible. If it's feasible, we try a smaller number of piles; otherwise, we try a larger number.\",\n    \"The `last` dictionary keeps track of the remaining strength available at the top of each pile. For each box being considered, the algorithm tries to place it on top of one of the piles. If placing a box reduces the remaining strength below zero, it is considered impossible and the function returns False.\",\n    \"The constraint is enforced in the `possible(s)` function. The simulation of building the piles implicitly ensures that at most one box is placed directly on top of another, as the algorithm proceeds from top to bottom, always checking and reducing the remaining strength of the top box of each pile.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
