Your task will be to find that integer. \\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n`[1, -1, 2, -2, 3] => 3`\\n\\n`3` has no matching negative appearance\\n\\n`[-3, 1, 2, 3, -1, -4, -2] => -4`\\n\\n`-4` has no matching positive appearance\\n\\n`[1, -1, 2, -2, 3, 3] => 3`\\n\\n(the only-positive or only-negative integer may appear more than once)\\n\\nGood luck!\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def solve(arr):\\n\\treturn sum(set(arr))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem Requirements: The problem requires identifying the single integer in an array that does not have a corresponding positive or negative counterpart. The array contains pairs of integers where both the positive and negative versions are present, except for one integer.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: The presence of duplicates needs to be considered, as the unique integer might appear multiple times. The problem statement also specifies that the integer is either only positive or only negative.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Since we're looking for a single unique integer, using set operations to eliminate duplicates seems appropriate. Then, summing all the unique integers will isolate the unique number.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Converting the array to a set eliminates duplicates, allowing the sum to directly identify the integer with no corresponding positive/negative counterpart.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for an integer to have both a positive and negative value in the context of this problem?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: It means that if an integer 'x' is present in the array, then '-x' is also present in the array, except for the integer that needs to be found.\",\n    \"How would you handle the presence of duplicate numbers in the array?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: Convert the array to a set to eliminate duplicates. This ensures that each unique number is considered only once when searching for the integer without a corresponding positive or negative value.\",\n    \"What properties does the target integer (the one to be found) possess?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: The target integer is either only positive or only negative. Furthermore, its opposite (negative or positive, respectively) is not present in the array.\",\n    \"If the array contains [1, -1, 2, -2, 3, 3], how would you identify '3' as the solution?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: First, convert the array to a set: {1, -1, 2, -2, 3}. Then, sum the elements of the set. The result will be 3, which is the desired answer.\",\n    \"Can you explain how summing the elements of the set isolates the target integer?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: Since every other number will have its negative counterpart, the numbers will cancel each other out in the sum, leaving only the target integer.\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Expected Answer: It means that if an integer 'x' is present in the array, then '-x' is also present in the array, except for the integer that needs to be found.\",\n    \"Expected Answer: Convert the array to a set to eliminate duplicates.
