"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"## Debugging sayHello function\\n\\nThe starship Enterprise has run into some problem when creating a program to greet everyone as they come aboard. It is your job to fix the code and get the program working again!\\n\\nExample output: \\n```\\nHello, Mr. Spock\\n```\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def say_hello(name):\\n\\treturn f'Hello, {name}'\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Identifying the Core Issue: Recognize that the sayHello function should take a name as input and return a greeting string.\\n- Inspecting the Provided Code: Examine the existing code for syntax errors, logical errors, and deviations from the expected output.\\n- Applying Debugging Techniques: Test the function with sample inputs to identify discrepancies between the expected and actual output.\\n- Ensuring Correct String Formatting: Verify that the greeting string is correctly formatted to include the name.\\n- Considering Edge Cases: Check for scenarios where the name might be empty or contain special characters.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the expected input to the sayHello function, and what type of data should it be?\",\n    \"How should the output string be formatted to include the given name?\",\n    \"What are some potential syntax errors that might prevent the function from working correctly?\",\n    \"If the function produces an incorrect greeting, how can you test it with different inputs to identify the cause?\",\n    \"Are there any edge cases to consider when handling the input name, such as an empty string or special characters?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The function should accept a string representing the name of the person to greet.\",\n    \"The output should be a string that starts with 'Hello, ' followed by the name and any appropriate punctuation (e.g., 'Hello, Mr. Spock').\",\n    \"Potential syntax errors might include missing colons, incorrect indentation, or incorrect use of string formatting.\",\n    \"By testing with different names (e.g., an empty string, a name with special characters) and comparing the output to the expected output, you can identify formatting or handling issues.\",\n    \"Edge cases include an empty name string (which should still produce a valid greeting like 'Hello, '), names with leading or trailing spaces, or names with special characters that might need escaping.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
