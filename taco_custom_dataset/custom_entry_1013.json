The value of each contiguous subarray of given array is the maximum element present in that subarray. The task is to return the number of subarrays having value strictly greater than K.\\nExample 1:\\nInput:\\nN = 3, K = 2\\nArr[] = {3, 2, 1}\\nOutput: 3\\nExplanation: The subarrays having value\\nstrictly greater than K are: [3], [3, 2]\\nand [3, 2, 1].

A single pass through the array should be sufficient.\\n- Implementation Details: Iterate through the array, keeping track of the last index where an element greater than K was found. The difference between the current index and the last index with a value > K contributes to the number of subarrays ending at the current index and having a max value > K.\\n- Edge Cases: Consider what happens when the array is empty or contains no elements greater than K.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the definition of a contiguous subarray?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently find the maximum element of a subarray without iterating through the entire subarray each time?\",\n    \"How can you keep track of the number of subarrays that meet the criteria in O(1) space?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases to consider for this problem?\",\n    \"How does the algorithm account for consecutive elements greater than K?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A contiguous subarray is a sequence of consecutive elements from the original array.\",\n    \"Since we only need to check if the *maximum* element of the subarray is greater than K, we can observe elements as we iterate, and if an element > K is found, then *all* subarrays ending at that index and starting from the last index where an element > k was found will satisfy the condition.\",\n    \"By maintaining a running count of subarrays that meet the condition and updating it as you iterate through the array.\",\n    \"The edge cases include an empty array, an array where all elements are less than or equal to K, and an array where all elements are greater than K.\",\n    \"The algorithm maintains an index ('ind') representing the last position where an element greater than 'K' was seen. If there are consecutive elements greater than 'K', this index will be updated, and the calculation `i - ind` will correctly count the subarrays.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
