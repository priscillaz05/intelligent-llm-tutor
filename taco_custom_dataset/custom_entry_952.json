This is Euler's totient function.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: The input n can be up to 10^6, so iterating through all numbers from 1 to n and checking for relative primality would be too slow. An efficient algorithm to calculate Euler's totient function is needed.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Implement Euler's totient function using prime factorization. Iterate through prime numbers up to the square root of n, and for each prime factor p, update the result using the formula res = res * (1 - 1/p).\\n- Implementation Considerations: Optimize the prime factorization process by only iterating up to the square root of n.
