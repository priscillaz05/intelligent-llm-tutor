"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"Mark and Jane are very happy after having their first child. Their son loves toys, so Mark wants to buy some. There are a number of different toys lying in front of him, tagged with their prices.  Mark has only a certain amount to spend, and he wants to maximize the number of toys he buys with this money.  Given a list of toy prices and an amount to spend, determine the maximum number of gifts he can buy.\\n\\nNote Each toy can be purchased only once.  \\n\\nExample \\n\\n$prices=[1,2,3,4]$ \\n\\n$k=7$   \\n\\nThe budget is $7$ units of currency.  He can buy items that cost $[1,2,3]$ for $\\\\boldsymbol{6}$, or $[3,4]$ for $7$ units.  The maximum is $3$ items.  \\n\\nFunction Description\\n\\nComplete the function maximumToys in the editor below.  \\n\\nmaximumToys has the following parameter(s):  \\n\\nint prices[n]:  the toy prices  \\nint k:  Mark's budget  \\n\\nReturns  \\n\\nint: the maximum number of toys  \\n\\nInput Format\\n\\nThe first line contains two integers, $n$ and $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mbox{k}}$, the number of priced toys and the amount Mark has to spend. \\n\\nThe next line contains $n$ space-separated integers $\\\\textit{prices[i]}$   \\n\\nConstraints\\n\\n$1\\\\leq n\\\\leq10^5$\\n\\n$1\\\\leq k\\\\leq10^9$\\n\\n$1\\\\leq prices[i]\\\\leq10^9$\\n\\nA toy can't be bought multiple times.\\n\\nSample Input\\n7 50\\n1 12 5 111 200 1000 10\\n\\nSample Output\\n4\\n\\nExplanation\\n\\nHe can buy only $4$ toys at most.

Each toy can only be bought once.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints: The constraints include the number of toys (n), Mark's budget (k), and the price of each toy. The key constraint is that we need to maximize the number of toys purchased within the given budget.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: A greedy approach works best here. Sort the prices in ascending order. Then, iterate through the sorted prices, buying each toy as long as the budget allows. Keep track of the number of toys purchased.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Consider the case where the budget is less than the price of the cheapest toy. Also, consider the case where n is 0 or k is 0.\\n- Optimization Considerations: Sorting the prices is crucial for the greedy approach to work effectively. Sorting allows us to prioritize buying the cheaper toys first, maximizing the number of toys we can buy within the budget.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the main objective of the problem, and what constraints are given?\",\n    \"How does sorting the toy prices help in finding the optimal solution?\",\n    \"How do you keep track of the toys purchased within the specified budget?\",\n    \"What are the different scenarios that could be considered edge cases, and how do we deal with each?\",\n    \"What assumptions are you making when approaching this problem using a greedy strategy, and why is that a good approach?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The main objective is to maximize the number of toys Mark can buy given a budget and a list of toy prices. The constraints are the number of toys, the budget, and the individual prices of the toys.\",\n    \"Sorting the toy prices in ascending order allows us to prioritize buying the cheaper toys first, ensuring that we can maximize the number of toys purchased within the given budget.\",\n    \"Iterate through the sorted prices, subtracting the price of each toy from the budget as long as the budget remains non-negative. Increment a counter each time a toy is bought to keep track of the number of purchased toys.\",\n    \"Edge cases include when the budget is less than the price of the cheapest toy (return 0 toys), and when there are no toys available (prices array is empty). We should also consider the case when the budget is 0.\",\n    \"The greedy strategy assumes that by always choosing the cheapest option (buying the cheapest available toy) we can arrive at the optimal solution (maximize the number of toys bought). This works because buying the cheapest toys allows Mark to buy more toys overall.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
