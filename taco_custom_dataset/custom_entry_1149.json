The median is the middle element when the array is sorted if the array has an odd number of elements. If the array has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements.\\n- Handling Special Conditions: Consider edge cases like empty array, array with one element, and array with two elements. Take into account whether the array length is even or odd.\\n- Selecting an Algorithm: Sort the array first. This allows easy identification of the middle element(s). Then find the median based on whether the array's length is even or odd. The overall time complexity is dominated by sorting i.e. O(n*log(n)).\\n- Implementation Considerations: Using built in sort function.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you handle the different scenarios for calculating the median when the array has an even vs. odd number of elements?\",\n    \"What is the significance of sorting the array for efficiently finding the median, and what is the time complexity of sorting?\",\n    \"Are there any edge cases to consider, such as an empty array or an array with a single element, and how should they be handled?\",\n    \"How can the floor value be computed? Does that change the code at all?\",\n    \"How does using a built-in sorting algorithm affect the overall space complexity of the solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"When the array has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element. When it has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements.\",\n    \"Sorting allows easy access to the middle element(s). The time complexity of efficient sorting algorithms is O(n*log(n)).\",\n    \"Yes, edge cases like an empty array should return a specific error value (e.g., -1). An array with a single element will simply return that element.\",\n    \"The floor value can be found after the average has been computed, by casting the float value to an integer.\",\n    \"Using a built-in sorting algorithm may have space complexity implications depending on the implementation. However, the problem constraints specify O(1) space complexity. Many built-in sorts do not satisfy that condition. \"\n  ]\n}\n```"
