The allowed operations are dividing by 2 if divisible by 2, dividing by 3 if divisible by 3, or decrementing by 1.\\n- Identifying Potential Strategies: Consider dynamic programming to store and reuse the minimum number of steps for smaller values of N. This avoids redundant calculations.\\n- Defining Base Cases: Start with the base case where N is 1, which requires 0 steps.\\n- Implementing Dynamic Programming: Create a DP array to store the minimum steps required to reach 1 from each number from 1 to N. Iterate through the numbers and determine the minimum steps based on the possible operations.\\n- Optimizing for Minimum Steps: At each step, consider all possible operations (dividing by 2, dividing by 3, or subtracting 1) and choose the operation that results in the fewest steps.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the possible operations we can perform on N to reduce it to 1?\",\n    \"How would you handle the base case where N is already equal to 1?\",\n    \"Why is dynamic programming suitable for this problem, and how can it help in finding the minimum steps?\",\n    \"How do you ensure that you are selecting the minimum possible steps at each iteration?\",\n    \"What is the significance of `MAX` value in the code, and how does it prevent incorrect minimization?\",\n    \"What would be the steps for N = 10? Can you walk me through your thought process and operations?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"We can divide N by 2 if N is divisible by 2, divide N by 3 if N is divisible by 3, or decrement N by 1.\",\n    \"If N is 1, the minimum number of steps is 0 because N is already at the target value.\",\n    \"Dynamic programming is suitable because the problem has overlapping subproblems. The minimum steps to reach 1 from a number can be reused to calculate the minimum steps for larger numbers. It also prevents recomputation.\",\n    \"At each iteration, we choose the minimum of the three possible operations: dividing by 2, dividing by 3, or subtracting 1. We use the DP array to find the fewest steps to reach 1 from the result of each operation.\",\n    \"`MAX` represents a large number that is used as a placeholder when division by 2 or 3 is not possible. It prevents the algorithm from incorrectly choosing a path that is not valid (e.g., dividing by 2 when N is not even).\",\n    \"For N=10, dp[10] = 1 + min(dp[9], MAX, dp[5]) because 10-1=9 and 10/2=5, 10/3 isn't an integer so MAX. Next dp[9] = 1 + min(dp[8], dp[3], dp[2]) because 9-1=8, 9/3=3, and 9/2 isn't an integer so MAX. We can traverse to solve subproblems similarly, eventually figuring out dp[10] = 3 from operations 10-1=9, 9/3=3, and 3/3=1.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
