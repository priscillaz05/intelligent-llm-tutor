"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"Sometimes some words like \\\"localization\\\" or \\\"internationalization\\\" are so long that writing them many times in one text is quite tiresome.\\n\\nLet's consider a word too long, if its length is strictly more than 10 characters. All too long words should be replaced with a special abbreviation.\\n\\nThis abbreviation is made like this: we write down the first and the last letter of a word and between them we write the number of letters between the first and the last letters. That number is in decimal system and doesn't contain any leading zeroes.\\n\\nThus, \\\"localization\\\" will be spelt as \\\"l10n\\\", and \\\"internationalization\u00bb will be spelt as \\\"i18n\\\".\\n\\nYou are suggested to automatize the process of changing the words with abbreviations. At that all too long words should be replaced by the abbreviation and the words that are not too long should not undergo any changes.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100). Each of the following n lines contains one word. All the words consist of lowercase Latin letters and possess the lengths of from 1 to 100 characters.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nPrint n lines. The i-th line should contain the result of replacing of the i-th word from the input data.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nInput\\n\\n4\\nword\\nlocalization\\ninternationalization\\npneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nword\\nl10n\\ni18n\\np43s\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"n = int(input())\\nif 1 <= n <= 100:\\n\\tfor i in range(n):\\n\\t\\tword = input()\\n\\t\\tif len(word) > 10:\\n\\t\\t\\tnumWord = str(len(word[1:-1]))\\n\\t\\t\\tprint(word[0] + numWord + word[-1])\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tprint(word)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understand the input format: The first line is the number of words, and the following lines are the words themselves.\\n- Determine the criteria for a \\\"too long\\\" word: A word is considered \\\"too long\\\" if its length is strictly greater than 10.\\n- Abbreviate long words: If a word is \\\"too long\\\", create an abbreviation consisting of the first letter, the number of characters between the first and last letters, and the last letter.\\n- Handle short words: If a word is not \\\"too long\\\", print it as is.\\n- Iterate through the input and apply the appropriate transformation to each word.\\n- Ensure adherence to input constraints: Verify the constraints on the number of words (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100) and word length (1 to 100 characters).\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do I determine if a word is \\\"too long\\\" based on the problem description?\",\n    \"How do I construct the abbreviation for a word that is considered \\\"too long\\\"?\",\n    \"How do I handle the input of multiple words and process them accordingly?\",\n    \"What is the appropriate data type to store the count of the middle characters of a word, and how can I ensure it's converted correctly to a string for concatenation?\",\n    \"What range of values for 'n' should the program accept, and what should happen if 'n' falls outside of this range?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A word is \\\"too long\\\" if its length (number of characters) is strictly greater than 10.\",\n    \"The abbreviation is formed by taking the first letter of the word, concatenating the number of characters between the first and last letters, and then concatenating the last letter of the word.\",\n    \"I should first read the integer 'n' indicating the number of words, then iterate 'n' times, reading one word in each iteration and processing it based on its length.\",\n    \"The count of the middle characters should be stored as an integer first and then explicitly converted into a string.
