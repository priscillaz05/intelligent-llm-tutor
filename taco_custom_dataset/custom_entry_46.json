We are allowed only operation moveCard(n) which moves the card with value n to the top of the pile. You are required to find out the minimum number of moveCard() operations required to sort the cards in increasing order.\\n \\nExample 1:\\nInput:\\nn  = 5\\na[] = {5, 1, 2, 3, 4}\\nOutput:\\n4\\nExplanation:\\n5 1 2 3 4              //given sequence\\n4 5 1 2 3              //moveCard(4)\\n3 4 5 1 2              //moveCard(3)\\n2 3 4 5 1              //moveCard(2)\\n1 2 3 4 5              //moveCard(1)\\nHence, minimum 4 operations are required.\\n \\nExample 2:\\nInput:\\nn = 4\\na[] = {3, 4, 2, 1}\\nOutput:\\n2\\nExplanation:\\n3 4 2 1             //given sequence\\n2 3 4 1             //moveCard(2)\\n1 2 3 4             //moveCard(1)\\nHence, minimum 2 operations are required.\\nYour Task:  \\nYou don't need to read input or print anything.

The goal is to find the minimum number of such operations needed.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: The array contains all numbers from 1 to n in some shuffled order. Consider the case where some elements are already in their sorted order at the end of array. No need to perform `moveCard` operation on those elements.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: The problem can be solved by identifying the longest suffix of the array which is already in the correct order. We reverse the array and then find the longest prefix where elements are consecutive and decreasing. The number of operations required is `n` minus the length of this prefix.\\n- Implementing Solution: Reverse the given array. Iterate through the array, finding the longest prefix that's sorted in consecutive decreasing order starting from `n`. The number of operations is `n` minus the length of that prefix.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does the `moveCard(n)` operation do, and how does it affect the ordering of the cards?\",\n    \"What are the optimal conditions for not performing a `moveCard` operation for a certain card, and how does this affect the overall strategy?\",\n    \"If multiple cards are already in increasing order at the end of the array, how can you leverage this to reduce the number of operations?\",\n    \"How would you approach finding the longest suffix already in sorted order efficiently, and what does it tell you about the required `moveCard` operations?\",\n    \"Can you describe how the array reversal and prefix-based approach helps in calculating the minimum number of operations, and what are the edge cases?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The `moveCard(n)` operation moves the card with value `n` to the top of the pile, changing the array's order by placing `n` at the beginning.\",\n    \"It is optimal not to perform a `moveCard` operation on a card if it's already in its correct sorted position at the end of the array. This reduces the total number of necessary operations.\",\n    \"If multiple cards are in increasing order at the end, they can be considered already sorted. Only cards that break this sorted sequence need to be moved, thus minimizing the operations.\",\n    \"To find the longest suffix already in sorted order efficiently, start from the end of the array and check if the elements are in consecutive increasing order. This indicates the number of elements that don't need to be moved.\",\n    \"Reversing the array allows for checking a decreasing prefix, representing the already sorted suffix in the original array. The length of this prefix is subtracted from `n` to find the minimum number of `moveCard` operations. Edge cases include when the array is already sorted or reverse sorted.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
