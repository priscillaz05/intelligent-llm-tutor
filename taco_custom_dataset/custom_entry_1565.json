However they know that no element should be present in the sets of both companies.\\n\\nIn order to avoid this representatives of both companies decided to make an agreement on the sets the companies should present. The sets should be chosen in the way that maximizes the total income of the companies.\\n\\nAll elements are enumerated with integers. The ChemForces company has discovered $n$ distinct chemical elements with indices $a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$, and will get an income of $x_i$ Berland rubles if the $i$-th element from this list is in the set of this company.\\n\\nThe TopChemist company discovered $m$ distinct chemical elements with indices $b_1, b_2, \\\\ldots, b_m$, and it will get an income of $y_j$ Berland rubles for including the $j$-th element from this list to its set.\\n\\nIn other words, the first company can present any subset of elements from ${a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n}$ (possibly empty subset), the second company can present any subset of elements from ${b_1, b_2, \\\\ldots, b_m}$ (possibly empty subset).

No element can be present in both sets. The input consists of the number of elements discovered by each company, along with the index and income associated with each element.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy Selection: Iterate through the elements of ChemForces, storing their indices and incomes in a dictionary and calculating their total income. Iterate through the elements of TopChemist. If an element's index is present in the ChemForces dictionary, update the total income by subtracting ChemForces' income for that element and adding the maximum of TopChemist's and ChemForces' income for that element. Otherwise, add TopChemist's income for that element to the total income. Print the final total income.\\n- Potential Pitfalls: Handle cases where an element is present in both companies' sets. Ensure that the dictionary lookup is efficient. Be mindful of large input values.\\n- Implementation Details: Use a dictionary to store element indices and incomes for ChemForces. Sum incomes separately. Compare the incomes when an element exists in both sets.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you efficiently determine if an element is present in both ChemForces and TopChemist's sets?\",\n    \"How do you handle the case where an element's index is present in both dictionaries, considering the goal of maximizing income?\",\n    \"How do you choose the best set of elements between the two companies, such that the combined income is maximized?\",\n    \"What data structures might be suitable for storing and efficiently accessing the element indices and incomes?\",\n    \"What approach can be taken to handle potential overflow issues given the large input values?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Use a dictionary (or hash map) to store the elements and incomes of one company, allowing for O(1) lookup to check if an element exists in both.\",\n    \"Compare the income from both companies for that element, and use the maximum income for either company in the final sum, ensuring no element is counted twice unless it's beneficial.\",\n    \"Iterate through all elements from both companies, and if an element is present in both sets, choose the most profitable version of the element or simply not select it if it leads to overall lower profit.\",\n    \"A dictionary is ideal for storing and retrieving element indices and their corresponding incomes with O(1) average time complexity.\",\n    \"Using 64 bit integer type or taking mod with a large number could solve the overflow issue.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
