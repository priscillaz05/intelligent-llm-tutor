Because he is a programmer, he used & as a bitwise AND for these two words represented as a integers in base 64 and got new word. Now Vanya thinks of some string s and wants to know the number of pairs of words of length |s| (length of s), such that their bitwise AND is equal to s. As this number can be large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7.\\n\\nTo represent the string as a number in numeral system with base 64 Vanya uses the following rules:  digits from '0' to '9' correspond to integers from 0 to 9;  letters from 'A' to 'Z' correspond to integers from 10 to 35;  letters from 'a' to 'z' correspond to integers from 36 to 61;  letter '-' correspond to integer 62;  letter '_' correspond to integer 63. \\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe only line of the input contains a single word s (1 \u2264 |s| \u2264 100 000), consisting of digits, lowercase and uppercase English letters, characters '-' and '_'.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nPrint a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of possible pairs of words, such that their bitwise AND is equal to string s modulo 10^9 + 7.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\nz\\n\\nOutput\\n3\\n\\nInput\\nV_V\\n\\nOutput\\n9\\n\\nInput\\nCodeforces\\n\\nOutput\\n130653412\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nFor a detailed definition of bitwise AND we recommend to take a look in the corresponding article in Wikipedia.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"from itertools import chain\\ndata = input()\\nMOD = 10 ** 9 + 7\\ntranslate = [chr(x) for x in chain(list(range(ord('0'), ord('9') + 1)), list(range(ord('A'), ord('Z') + 1)), list(range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1)), [ord('-'), ord('_'))])\\nassert len(translate) == 64\\ntranslate2 = {k: '{:0>6}'.format(bin(i)[2:]).count('0') for (i, k) in enumerate(translate)}\\nx = sum([translate2[ch] for ch in data])\\nprint(3 ** x % MOD)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem asks us to find the number of pairs of base-64 strings of length |s| whose bitwise AND is equal to s. The result should be modulo 10^9 + 7.\\n- Base-64 Conversion:  Each character in the input string s corresponds to a base-64 digit. The correspondence is defined as 0-9, A-Z, a-z, -, _. Each of these characters represents a number from 0 to 63.\\n- Bitwise AND Condition:  For the bitwise AND of two numbers to result in a specific number, we need to consider the binary representation of each number (since bitwise AND operates on bits).  We want to find pairs (a, b) such that a & b = s. Each character in 's' is the bitwise AND of corresponding characters in the pair of 'words'.\\n- Analyzing the Bitwise AND Operation: If a bit in the result s is 1, then both corresponding bits in a and b must be 1. If a bit in the result s is 0, then at least one of the corresponding bits in a and b must be 0.  If s[i] has a '0' bit at position j, then either a[i] or b[i] (or both) must have a '0' bit at that position. The number of combinations for a '0' bit at position j is 3. The possible pairs are (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0).\\n- Counting the Pairs: If we represent the numbers in binary using 6 bits each (as 64 = 2^6), then for each bit that is 0 in s[i], there are 3 possible pairs. If there are x number of 0 bits in total across the entire string s, then the answer is 3^x.\\n- Modulo Operation:  Since the answer can be very large, we should compute 3^x modulo 10^9 + 7.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does the conversion from the input characters to base-64 integers work, and what range of values do they represent?\",\n    \"Explain the bitwise AND operation in the context of this problem. How does the result of the AND operation constrain the possible values of the input numbers?\",\n    \"If a particular bit in the target string 's' is 0, how many combinations of bits in the pair of words will result in a 0 in the same position after the bitwise AND operation?\",\n    \"How can you calculate the total number of combinations of word pairs whose bitwise AND is equal to the target string 's', and why is it important to perform the modulo operation?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases or constraints that need to be considered when implementing the solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The input characters are converted to base-64 integers using the following rule: digits '0'-'9' map to 0-9, 'A'-'Z' map to 10-35, 'a'-'z' map to 36-61, '-' maps to 62, and '_' maps to 63. Thus they represent the range of integers from 0 to 63.\",\n    \"The bitwise AND operation compares the corresponding bits of two numbers. If both bits are 1, the resulting bit is 1; otherwise, the resulting bit is 0. In this problem, for the bitwise AND of two characters to equal a given character in the target string, we must ensure that the constraints imposed by the AND operation are satisfied for each corresponding bit.\",\n    \"If a bit in the target string 's' is 0, there are three possible combinations for the corresponding bits in the pair of words: (0, 0), (0, 1), and (1, 0).\",\n    \"To calculate the total number of combinations, you need to count the number of '0' bits in the binary representation of each character in the target string 's'. If there are 'x' '0' bits in total, the answer is 3^x. It is important to perform the modulo operation with 10^9 + 7 at each step of computing 3^x to prevent integer overflow and to ensure that the result is within the required range.\",\n    \"Edge cases include an empty input string. Also, it is important to handle the modulo operation correctly throughout the calculation to prevent overflow. The constraint on the length of the input string is |s| <= 100000, which suggests that the solution should be efficient.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
