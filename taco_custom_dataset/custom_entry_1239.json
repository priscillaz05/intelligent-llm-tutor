Identify that the goal is to find a submatrix with a GCD greater than 1.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Consider edge cases such as a matrix filled with 1s or prime numbers, which will not have a GCD greater than 1. Also, consider cases where the GCD is large, but the submatrix size is small compared to other submatrices.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Consider a brute-force approach where all possible submatrices are evaluated. Optimize by pruning branches when the GCD becomes 1, as expanding this submatrix further will not yield a better GCD. Implement a function to calculate GCD efficiently.\\n- Implementing the Solution: Implement a nested loop structure to define all possible submatrices. Calculate the GCD of each submatrix. Keep track of the largest submatrix found so far.
