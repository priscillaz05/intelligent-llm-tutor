He now has two strings A and B such that A = S[1, \\\\frac{N}{2}] and B = S[\\\\frac{N}{2} + 1, N]. \\n\\nMario is not sure about the order in which he should join the strings A and B to get the string S. Thus, he joins the strings in any random order. Find whether it is guaranteed that Mario will get the same string S if he joins the strings A and B in any order.\\n\\nNote that S[L, R] denotes a substring of string S starting at index L and having a length (R - L + 1).\\n\\n------ Input Format ------ \\n\\n- The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.\\n- Each test case consists of two lines of input:\\n- The first line of each test case contains N - the length of the initial string S.\\n- The second line contains the string S.\\n\\n------ Output Format ------ \\n\\nFor each test case, print YES if it is guaranteed that Mario will get the same string S irrespective of the order in which he joins the strings A and B and NO otherwise. \\n\\nYou may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YES, yEs, yes, and yeS will all be treated as identical).\\n\\n------ Constraints ------ \\n\\n$1 \u2264 T \u2264 3000$\\n$1 \u2264 N \u2264 1000$\\n$N$ is even.\\n$S$ consists of lowercase english alphabets.\\n\\n----- Sample Input 1 ------ \\n4\\n6\\nabcabc\\n6\\nabcdef\\n4\\naaaa\\n4\\nbaab\\n----- Sample Output 1 ------ \\nYES\\nNO\\nYES\\nNO\\n\\n----- explanation 1 ------ \\nTest case $1$: On breaking, the string $S$ gives $A = abc$ and $B = abc$. Thus, joining it in either way $(AB$ or $BA)$, would give the same string $S$.\\n\\nTest case $2$: On breaking, the string $S$ gives $A = abc$ and $B = def$. Joining it as $BA$ would give the string $defabc$ which is not equal to string $S$.\\n\\nTest case $3$: On breaking, the string $S$ gives $A = aa$ and $B = aa$. Thus, joining it in either way $(AB$ or $BA)$, would give the same string $S$.\\n\\nTest case $4$: On breaking, the string $S$ gives $A = ba$ and $B = ab$. Joining it as $BA$ would give the string $abba$ which is not equal to string $S.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"t = int(input())\\nfor i in range(t):\\n\\tn = int(input())\\n\\ts = input()\\n\\ta = s[:n // 2]\\n\\tb = s[n // 2:]\\n\\tif a == b:\\n\\t\\tprint('YES')\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tprint('NO')\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding Problem Constraints: Recognize that the string S is broken into two equal halves, A and B. Understand the core task is to determine if concatenating A and B in either order (AB or BA) will result in the same string S, which implicitly means A must equal B.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Consider edge cases like empty strings or strings of very short lengths. Note that the problem states that N is even, eliminating cases with odd length strings.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Split the given string into two halves. Compare the two halves; if they are identical, it will always return true regardless of the ordering.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Careful indexing is needed to split the string correctly.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for two strings A and B, when concatenated in any order, to always result in the same string?\",\n    \"If the length N is even, how do you accurately split string S into two substrings A and B of equal length?\",\n    \"What condition must be satisfied by substrings A and B such that AB and BA always result in the same string?\",\n    \"What edge cases, if any, do you need to consider for this particular problem, given the constraints?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently compare the two substrings in Python to determine if they are equal?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"It means the strings A and B must be equal to each other. If A equals B, then AB will be the same as BA.\",\n    \"If the length N of string S is even, you can split it into A (S[0: N//2]) and B (S[N//2:]).\",\n    \"The condition is that A must be equal to B. Only then, whether you concatenate AB or BA, the resulting string will be the same.\",\n    \"Given the constraints, no specific edge cases need to be handled as N is always even and within a manageable range, and the input will always contain the number of test cases. Strings will also be comprised of lowercase characters.\",\n    \"You can directly use the '==' operator in Python to compare if A == B. This is a very efficient and pythonic way to check equality of strings.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
