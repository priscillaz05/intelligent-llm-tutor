Since there are always more factors of 2 than 5, the problem reduces to counting the number of factors of 5.\\n- Identifying the Key Insight: Notice that multiples of 5 contribute one 5 each, multiples of 25 contribute an additional 5, multiples of 125 contribute yet another 5, and so on. So, the count is the sum of N // 5 + N // 25 + N // 125 + ...\\n- Selecting an Iterative Strategy: Employ a loop where N is successively divided by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) until N becomes 0. Sum the integer quotients at each stage to get the total count of trailing zeros.\\n- Optimizing for Efficiency: Acknowledge that the loop will naturally terminate when N becomes zero because integer division by larger powers of 5 will eventually yield 0. Realize that no extra space is required because the solution only requires one variable to accumulate the count and N is modified in place.\\n- Implementing the Solution: Set an initial count to 0. While N is greater than 0, add N // 5 to the count and then update N to N // 5.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What causes trailing zeros in a factorial, and what determines the number of trailing zeros?\",\n    \"Why is it sufficient to count the number of factors of 5 instead of both 2 and 5?\",\n    \"How do you account for numbers that have multiple factors of 5, like 25, 125, and so on?\",\n    \"Can you explain the iterative process of dividing N by increasing powers of 5?\",\n    \"How can the code be optimized to ensure it meets the O(logN) time complexity and O(1) space complexity requirements?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Trailing zeros in a factorial are caused by pairs of 2 and 5 in its prime factorization.

To account for this, you must add N // 5, N // 25, N // 125, and so on until the quotient becomes 0.\",\n    \"The iterative process involves repeatedly dividing N by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) and summing the integer quotients at each stage. This accounts for all the factors of 5 in the numbers from 1 to N.\",\n    \"The code is already optimized because it uses a while loop that divides N by 5 in each iteration until N becomes 0, which ensures a time complexity of O(logN). It also uses only a constant amount of extra space, satisfying the O(1) space complexity requirement.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
