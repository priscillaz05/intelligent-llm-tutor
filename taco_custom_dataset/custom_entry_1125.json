He enjoys playing algorithmic games a lot.\\n\\nOne of the seniors gave Happy PMP a nice game. He is given two permutations of numbers 1 through n and is asked to convert the first one to the second. In one move he can remove the last number from the permutation of numbers and inserts it back in an arbitrary position. He can either insert last number between any two consecutive numbers, or he can place it at the beginning of the permutation.\\n\\nHappy PMP has an algorithm that solves the problem. But it is not fast enough. He wants to know the minimum number of moves to convert the first permutation to the second. \\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b7105) \u2014 the quantity of the numbers in the both given permutations. \\n\\nNext line contains n space-separated integers \u2014 the first permutation. Each number between 1 to n will appear in the permutation exactly once. \\n\\nNext line describe the second permutation in the same format.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nPrint a single integer denoting the minimum number of moves required to convert the first permutation to the second.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nInput\\n\\n3\\n3 2 1\\n1 2 3\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n5\\n1 2 3 4 5\\n1 5 2 3 4\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n5\\n1 5 2 3 4\\n1 2 3 4 5\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n3\\n\\nNote\\n\\nIn the first sample, he removes number 1 from end of the list and places it at the beginning.

A move consists of removing the last element of l1 and inserting it at any position. The permutations contain numbers from 1 to n.\\n- Identifying a key idea: The key observation is that the longest common suffix between l1 and l2 will not require any moves, so the elements that are not part of the longest common suffix are the ones that need to be moved.\\n- Developing the algorithm: The algorithm involves finding the longest common suffix between l1 and l2. Iterate through l2 from the end to the beginning, and simultaneously keep track of the index in l1. If the elements match, decrement the l1 index. If the elements do not match, move the l1 index to the left until it finds a matching element or reaches the beginning. Maintain a 'used' set to avoid counting elements multiple times in cases where l1 has duplicate elements that need to be skipped. The number of moves is calculated as len(l1) - (index of the start of the common suffix) - 1. Specifically, all the items in l1 after worst index will be kept as is.\\n- Handling edge cases: Consider cases where either l1 or l2 is empty, or where l1 and l2 are identical.\\n- Implementation considerations: Pay close attention to index management and boundary conditions.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does the problem ask for, and what constraints are given?\",\n    \"What is the significance of the longest common suffix between the two permutations?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently find the longest common suffix between the two lists?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the minimum number of moves based on the longest common suffix?\",\n    \"What is the purpose of the `used` set in the provided solution?\",\n    \"What are some edge cases to consider, and how would they affect your solution?\",\n    \"Explain how the index variables i and j are used to track the progress within l1 and l2 respectively.\",\n    \"Given an example of l1 and l2 with n = 5, such as l1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and l2 = [1, 5, 2, 3, 4], trace the execution of the code to determine the output.\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The problem asks for the minimum number of moves to transform permutation l1 into permutation l2, where a move consists of removing the last element of l1 and inserting it at any position. The permutations contain numbers from 1 to n.\",\n    \"The longest common suffix is important because the elements within it are already in the correct order and position, so they don't need to be moved. Therefore, the number of moves is directly related to the elements that are not part of the longest common suffix.\",\n    \"An efficient way to find the longest common suffix is to iterate through l2 from the end and simultaneously traverse l1 from the end, comparing elements and adjusting the l1 index when mismatches are found.\",\n    \"The minimum number of moves is calculated as the total length of l1 minus the length of the longest common suffix, which can be represented as len(l1) - (index where the common suffix starts) - 1.\",\n    \"The `used` set is used to track elements that have already been considered and skipped in l1, especially in cases where there might be duplicate elements in l1 or when skipping irrelevant elements while looking for a match with l2.\",\n    \"Edge cases include scenarios where either l1 or l2 is empty (in which case the number of moves would be 0 or len(l1) -1) or cases where l1 and l2 are identical (in which case the number of moves would be 0).\",\n    \"The index `i` iterates from the end to the start of the l2 and used to access values in l2. `j` iterates similarly through l1, but can also decrement faster than `i` as it looks for matching values to `l2[i]`. `j` essentially tracks where the common suffix ends in l1.\",\n    \"For the example l1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and l2 = [1, 5, 2, 3, 4]:\\n- n = 5\\n- l1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\\n- l2 = [1, 5, 2, 3, 4]\\n- used = {}\\n- j = 4\\n- worst = 4\\n- The loop starts:\\n  - i = 4, l2[4] = 4\\n  - l2[4] != l1[4] (4 != 5)\\n  - while l2[4] != l1[j]:\\n    - used.add(l1[4]) (used = {5})\\n    - j -= 1 (j = 3)\\n  - l2[4] == l1[3] (4 == 4)\\n  - j -= 1 (j = 2)\\n  - i = 3, l2[3] = 3\\n  - l2[3] != l1[2] (3 != 3)\\n    - j -= 1 (j = 1)\\n    - used.add(l1[2]) (used = {5,3})\\n  - l2[3] == l1[1] (3 != 2) \\n    - used.add(l1[1]) (used = {5,3,2})\\n  - j -= 1 (j=0) \\n  - l2[3] == l1[0] (3 != 1)\\n  - Used add l1[0](used = {5,3,2,1})\\n  j -=1\\n  worst = j +1 = -1 + 1 = 0\\n- The loops continues for values in L2: \\n- The final Output is len(l1) -worst -1 =  5 - 0 - 1 = 4\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
