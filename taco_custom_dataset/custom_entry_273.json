The selection will be made with the help of a single problem. Blatnatalag, a friend of Iahub, managed to get hold of the problem before the contest. Because he wants to make sure Iahub will be the one qualified, he tells Iahub the following task.\\n\\nYou're given an (1-based) array a with n elements. Let's define function f(i, j) (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n) as (i - j)^2 + g(i, j)^2. Function g is calculated by the following pseudo-code:\\n\\n\\n\\nint g(int i, int j) {\\n\\n    int sum = 0;\\n\\n    for (int k = min(i, j) + 1; k <= max(i, j); k = k + 1)\\n\\n        sum = sum + a[k];\\n\\n    return sum;\\n\\n}\\n\\n\\n\\nFind a value min_{i} \u2260 j\\u00a0\\u00a0f(i, j).\\n\\nProbably by now Iahub already figured out the solution to this problem.

Consider edge cases such as small array sizes. Also, think about optimizing the calculation of g(i, j).\\n- Optimization Strategies: Observe that g(i, j) involves calculating the sum of elements within a range. Precomputing prefix sums can help compute g(i, j) in O(1) time.  After precomputation, iterating through all possible pairs is still O(n^2). The given ground truth solution implements a divide and conquer approach which can potentially be faster than brute force.\\n- Divide and Conquer Approach: The reference solution uses divide and conquer. It splits the array into two halves recursively, computes the minimum distance in each half, and then merges the results. During the merge, it enhances the data by considering only the points that are within a certain distance of the middle point.  It then sorts these points and compares the distances between them to further reduce the minimum distance.\\n- Data Structure Choice: The provided code uses a custom `splitFeature` class, storing the position and value for each element. It creates an array of features, which are sorted based on position and value.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can precomputed prefix sums be utilized to efficiently compute g(i, j), and what would be the time complexity of this operation?\",\n    \"The naive approach of computing f(i, j) for all pairs (i, j) has a time complexity of O(n^2). Can you suggest optimizations or alternative approaches to improve upon this complexity?\",\n    \"Can you describe the purpose of the enhanceData function, and explain how it helps in reducing the number of distance calculations?\",\n    \"What is the time complexity of the analyzeData function, and how does divide and conquer contribute to the overall performance?\",\n    \"Can you explain what the custom splitFeature class is used for, and what the purpose of storing both the position and cumulative sum is?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Prefix sums can be precomputed in O(n) time.  Then g(i, j) can be calculated in O(1) time using prefix_sum[max(i, j)] - prefix_sum[min(i, j)].\",\n    \"We can optimize by using divide and conquer, which breaks the problem into smaller subproblems. However the time complexity of the given solution is still not immediately obvious.\",\n    \"The enhanceData function aims to reduce the number of distance calculations by only considering points that are relatively close to the dividing line in terms of their position. It then sorts these points based on their value and further optimizes by breaking the inner loop early if the distance exceeds the current minimum.\",\n    \"The analyzeData function has a time complexity that is better than O(n^2). Divide and conquer splits the array to solve two halves, and merges them in linear time. Thus, making the overall time complexity O(n log n).\",\n    \"The `splitFeature` class is used to store the index (position) and the cumulative sum (value) of the array elements. This allows us to calculate the g(i, j) function efficiently using the cumulative sums, and also preserves original indices which are needed for computing the other part of the equation, i.e., (i - j)^2.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
