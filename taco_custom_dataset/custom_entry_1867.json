We need to iterate through all possible subarrays and check if the maximum element of each subarray is within the specified range.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: We should consider edge cases such as empty arrays, arrays with all elements outside the range, and arrays with elements both inside and outside the range. We also want to ensure we do this with O(N) time complexity and O(1) auxiliary space.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: An approach that maintains a sliding window to track elements satisfying the given condition should work. This will help keep track of the starting point of a valid subarray and compute the number of subarrays ending at each index which have the max element in range [L, R].\\n- Implementing the Solution: Implement a single pass algorithm that keeps track of the start of a valid subarray range (fp), the current element's index (lp), and number of valid subarrays ending at index lp (prev). When a valid number is encountered prev is updated to lp - fp + 1. Otherwise, if the number is larger than R, reset the start of subarray and reset prev.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for a subarray to have a maximum element within the range [L, R]?\",\n    \"How would you efficiently iterate through all possible subarrays of the given array?\",\n    \"What strategy might you employ to avoid recalculating the maximum element of each subarray repeatedly?\",\n    \"How can you keep track of the number of valid subarrays as you iterate through the array?\",\n    \"What are the key edge cases and constraints that should be considered while implementing the solution to optimize for time and space?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"It means that the largest element in the subarray must be greater than or equal to L and less than or equal to R.\",\n    \"You can use a nested loop approach, where the outer loop iterates from the start of the array to the end, and the inner loop iterates from the current index of the outer loop to the end of the array. Each iteration of the inner loop forms a subarray.\",\n    \"Instead of recalculating the maximum for each subarray, you can update it incrementally as you extend the subarray.\",\n    \"You can maintain a counter that is updated each time you encounter a new valid subarray. A variable can keep track of previous valid counts, which can be added to the total valid subarray count.\",\n    \"Edge cases include empty arrays, and arrays where no subarray meets the criteria.
