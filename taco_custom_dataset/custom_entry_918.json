The algorithm must have O(N) time complexity and O(1) space complexity, indicating a sliding window approach might be suitable.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: A sliding window technique can be used to compute the sum of each subarray of size K. Maintain a window of size K and slide it across the array. Calculate the sum of elements within the window and update the maximum sum encountered so far.\\n- Handling Edge Cases and Optimizations:  Consider the case when K = N (the entire array is the subarray), and ensure the algorithm correctly handles this. Avoid redundant calculations by subtracting the outgoing element and adding the incoming element as the window slides.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for a subarray to be contiguous, and how does this constraint affect the choice of algorithm?\",\n    \"Given that the expected time complexity is O(N) and space complexity is O(1), what approach would be most appropriate for solving this problem?\",\n    \"How does the sliding window technique work, and how can it efficiently compute the sum of each subarray of size K?\",\n    \"How can the algorithm be optimized to avoid redundant calculations as the window slides through the array?\",\n    \"What are some potential edge cases to consider, such as when K equals N, and how can these be handled correctly?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A contiguous subarray means that all elements within the subarray must be adjacent to each other in the original array. This constraint implies that we need an algorithm that considers the elements sequentially, making the sliding window technique a fitting choice.\",\n    \"With the O(N) time complexity and O(1) space complexity constraints, a sliding window approach is optimal. It allows processing each element a fixed number of times without using extra space proportional to the input size.\",\n    \"The sliding window technique maintains a window of size K and computes the sum of elements within it. As the window slides, the algorithm adds the next element and removes the first element from the previous window, effectively calculating the sum of the next subarray.\",\n    \"To optimize, as the window slides, subtract the element leaving the window and add the element entering the window instead of recomputing the sum each time. This reduces the number of operations required.\",\n    \"Edge cases include when K equals N, in which case the sum of the entire array should be returned. The code should ensure this case is properly handled. Additionally, ensure that K is always less than or equal to N.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
