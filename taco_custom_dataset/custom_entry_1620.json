He secretly found out one of the questions from the test.\\nAs the test is online, he wants to write a code that solves the question. However, he is not good at coding and thus, wants Chef to help him with that.\\n\\nChef is given a function F(X) such that the condition:\\nF(X) = F(2\\\\cdot X)  \\nholds true for all X, where X is a positive integer.\\n\\nFor a given positive integer N, find the maximum number of distinct elements in the array [F(1), F(2), F(3), \\\\ldots, F(N)].\\n\\n------ Input Format ------ \\n\\n- First line will contain T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\\n- Each test case contains a single line of input, one integer N.\\n\\n------ Output Format ------ \\n\\nFor each test case, output in a single line, the maximum number of distinct elements in the array [F(1), F(2), F(3), \\\\ldots, F(N)].\\n\\n------ Constraints ------ \\n\\n$1 \u2264 T \u2264 1000$\\n$1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^{9}$\\n\\n------ subtasks ------ \\n\\nSubtask 1 (30 points): $1 \u2264 N \u2264 1000$\\nSubtask 2 (70 points): Original Constraints.\\n\\n----- Sample Input 1 ------ \\n2\\n2\\n5\\n----- Sample Output 1 ------ \\n1\\n3\\n----- explanation 1 ------ \\nTest case $1$: Let $X = 1$. Thus, $2 = 2\\\\cdot 1 = 2\\\\cdot X$. Therefore, $F(1) = F(2)$. So, in the array $[F(1), F(2)]$, there is only $1$ distinct element.\\n\\nTest case $2$: Here, we can take $X = 1$. Thus $F(1) = F(2)$. Similarly, if we take $X = 2$, $F(2) = F(4)$. This means that $F(1) = F(2) = F(4)$.  \\nHowever, it can be possible that the values $F(1), F(3),$ and $F(5)$ are distinct. Hence, the maximum number of distinct elements in the array $[F(1), F(2), F(3), F(4), F(5)]$ is $3$.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"p = int(input())\\nwhile p > 0:\\n\\tn = int(input())\\n\\tpp = int((n + 1) / 2)\\n\\tprint(pp)\\n\\tp = p - 1\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem states that F(X) = F(2*X) for all positive integers X. We are given an array [F(1), F(2), ..., F(N)] and asked to find the maximum number of distinct elements in the array.\\n- Identifying the Pattern: Since F(X) = F(2*X), this means F(1) = F(2), F(3) = F(6), F(5) = F(10) and so on.  In general, for any odd number i, F(i) = F(i * 2^k) where i * 2^k <= N.  This suggests that we should consider the odd numbers less than or equal to N.\\n- Counting the Odd Numbers: The number of odd numbers from 1 to N is (N + 1) / 2, using integer division. For instance, if N = 5, then the odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, and (5 + 1) / 2 = 3.\\n- Writing the Code: Read the number of test cases T. For each test case, read N, calculate (N + 1) / 2, and print the result.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does the condition F(X) = F(2*X) imply about the function F?\",\n    \"How can we determine the maximum number of distinct elements given the constraint F(X) = F(2*X)?\",\n    \"Why are we counting odd numbers, and how does this relate to the distinct elements of the function?\",\n    \"How do we calculate the number of odd numbers between 1 and N, inclusive?\",\n    \"What is the significance of the test cases and the provided examples?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"It implies that the value of the function F at any number X is equal to the value of F at 2 times X, 4 times X, 8 times X, and so on. In other words, F(X) = F(2X) = F(4X) = F(8X) ...\",\n    \"The maximum number of distinct elements corresponds to the number of odd numbers between 1 and N, inclusive. This is because F(any odd number) can be different from F(any other odd number).\",\n    \"Each odd number 'i' will have the same function value as i * 2, i * 4, i * 8 and so on.  Therefore, we only need to consider the function values at odd indices since all the even indexed values are equivalent to some odd indexed value. Thus, the number of odd integers from 1 to N determine the maximum number of distinct elements.\",\n    \"The number of odd numbers between 1 and N, inclusive, can be calculated by (N + 1) // 2, where // denotes integer division.\",\n    \"The test cases and provided examples demonstrate how the constraint F(X) = F(2*X) affects the number of distinct elements in the array. They illustrate that F(1) = F(2), F(1) = F(2) = F(4) etc. The answer is the number of odd numbers between 1 to N\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
