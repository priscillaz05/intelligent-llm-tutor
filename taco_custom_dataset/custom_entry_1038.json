This involves using the modulo operator (%) and integer division (//).\\n- Establishing Base Cases and Edge Cases: Consider the base case where the input is 0, and how to handle numbers less than 20, between 20-99, and then 100-999.\\n- Utilizing Lookups for English Words: Use arrays or dictionaries to map numbers to their corresponding English word representations. This includes handling special cases like \\\"eleven\\\" to \\\"nineteen\\\" which don't follow the regular pattern.\\n- Constructing the English Representation: Combine the English representations of each chunk, adding the appropriate magnitude labels (Thousand, Million, Billion) and handling spaces and edge cases to ensure correct formatting.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you approach converting an integer into English words by processing it in chunks?\",\n    \"What data structures are useful for storing the English word representations for numbers?\",\n    \"How do you combine the English word representations of different magnitude chunks like hundreds, thousands, and millions?\",\n    \"What special cases or edge conditions should you handle to ensure the output is correct and well-formatted?\",\n    \"How would you test your solution to ensure that it correctly handles various input values within the given range?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"I would divide the number into chunks of three digits (hundreds, thousands, millions, etc.) using modulo and integer division. Each chunk is converted into its English word representation separately, and then they're combined with the appropriate magnitude label.\",\n    \"Arrays or dictionaries (hash maps) can be effectively used to store the mapping between numbers and their English word representations, especially for ones, teens, and tens.\",\n    \"To combine the chunks, I would start with the least significant chunk (hundreds) and iteratively add the representations of higher magnitude chunks. I'd append the magnitude labels ('Thousand', 'Million', 'Billion') after each chunk and handle spaces appropriately to ensure correct formatting.\",\n    \"Special cases include zero, numbers less than 20 (where the mapping is irregular), and ensuring proper spacing and concatenation of words. I also need to handle cases where a chunk is zero and should not be included in the output.\",\n    \"I would test the solution with a variety of inputs, including small numbers (e.g., 0, 1, 10, 12, 19), numbers in the hundreds (e.g., 123, 999), numbers in the thousands (e.g., 12345, 99999), numbers in the millions (e.g., 1234567), and the maximum possible value (2147483647). This helps to ensure the algorithm handles the full range of inputs correctly.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
