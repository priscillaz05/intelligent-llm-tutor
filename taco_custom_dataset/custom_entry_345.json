Increment a counter when both conditions are met.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Address edge cases where '2' appears at the end of the string, ensuring the algorithm does not try to access an out-of-bounds index.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for a penalty to result in a goal, according to the string?\",\n    \"How would you iterate through the string to check for penalties and subsequent goals?\",\n    \"What kind of edge cases would you consider while iterating through the string?\",\n    \"How should the algorithm handle the situation when the '2' character is at the last index of the string?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A penalty results in a goal when the character '2' is immediately followed by the character '1' in the string.\",\n    \"I would iterate through the string using a loop, checking each character.
