Understand that the task is to output the level order traversal of this tree, but each level should be sorted.\\n- Identifying Level Sizes: Determine how to calculate the size of each level in a complete binary tree. Realize that level 0 has size 1, level 1 has size 2, level 2 has size 4, and so on (2^level).\\n- Choosing a Traversal Strategy: Implement a level-order traversal, extracting the elements for each level and sorting them before adding them to the result. Handle the case where the last level may not be complete.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Consider edge cases like an empty array or an array with only one element.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How is a complete binary tree represented in an array in level order?\",\n    \"How can you determine the number of nodes at each level of the tree?\",\n    \"How would you extract and sort the nodes for each level of the tree?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases and how should they be handled?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A complete binary tree in level order is represented in an array where the root is at index 0, the next two elements are its children (level 1), the next four elements are their children (level 2), and so on.\",\n    \"The number of nodes at level 'l' is 2^l, where l starts from 0 at the root.\",\n    \"For each level, determine the start and end indices in the array corresponding to the level.
