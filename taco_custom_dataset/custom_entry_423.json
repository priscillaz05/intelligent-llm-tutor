Curiously enough, the beliefs of the inhabitants require the time needed to pass each road to be equal either to $a$ or $b$ seconds. It's guaranteed that one can go between any pair of settlements by following a sequence of roads.\\n\\nCodefortia was recently struck by the financial crisis. Therefore, the king decided to abandon some of the roads so that:\\n\\n  it will be possible to travel between each pair of cities using the remaining roads only,  the sum of times required to pass each remaining road will be minimum possible (in other words, remaining roads must form minimum spanning tree, using the time to pass the road as its weight),  among all the plans minimizing the sum of times above, the time required to travel between the king's residence (in settlement $1$) and the parliament house (in settlement $p$) using the remaining roads only will be minimum possible. \\n\\nThe king, however, forgot where the parliament house was. For each settlement $p = 1, 2, \\\\dots, n$, can you tell what is the minimum time required to travel between the king's residence and the parliament house (located in settlement $p$) after some roads are abandoned?\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line of the input contains four integers $n$, $m$, $a$ and $b$ ($2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 70$, $n - 1 \\\\leq m \\\\leq 200$, $1 \\\\leq a < b \\\\leq 10^7$) \u2014 the number of settlements and gravel roads in Codefortia, and two possible travel times. Each of the following lines contains three integers $u, v, c$ ($1 \\\\leq u, v \\\\leq n$, $u \\\\neq v$, $c \\\\in \\\\{a, b\\\\}$) denoting a single gravel road between the settlements $u$ and $v$, which requires $c$ minutes to travel.\\n\\nYou can assume that the road network is connected and has no loops or multiedges.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nOutput a single line containing $n$ integers. The $p$-th of them should denote the minimum possible time required to travel from $1$ to $p$ after the selected roads are abandoned. Note that for each $p$ you can abandon a different set of roads.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n5 5 20 25\\n1 2 25\\n2 3 25\\n3 4 20\\n4 5 20\\n5 1 20\\n\\nOutput\\n0 25 60 40 20\\n\\nInput\\n6 7 13 22\\n1 2 13\\n2 3 13\\n1 4 22\\n3 4 13\\n4 5 13\\n5 6 13\\n6 1 13\\n\\nOutput\\n0 13 26 39 26 13\\n\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nThe minimum possible sum of times required to pass each road in the first example is $85$ \u2014 exactly one of the roads with passing time $25$ must be abandoned. Note that after one of these roads is abandoned, it's now impossible to travel between settlements $1$ and $3$ in time $50$.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import heapq\\n(n, m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())\\ngraph = {i: [] for i in range(n)}\\nfor i in range(m):\\n\\t(u, v, w) = map(int, input().split())\\n\\tgraph[u - 1].append((v - 1, w))\\n\\tgraph[v - 1].append((u - 1, w))\\ncomponents = [-1] * n\\ncomp = -1\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\tif components[i] == -1:\\n\\t\\tcomp += 1\\n\\t\\tcomponents[i] = comp\\n\\t\\tprev = []\\n\\t\\tlayer = [i]\\n\\t\\twhile layer != []:\\n\\t\\t\\tnewlayer = []\\n\\t\\t\\tfor guy in layer:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor guy1 in graph[guy]:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tif guy1[1] == a and components[guy1[0]] == -1:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnewlayer.append(guy1[0])\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcomponents[guy1[0]] = comp\\n\\t\\t\\tprev = layer[:]\\n\\t\\t\\tlayer = newlayer[:]\\nuseless = []\\nfor guy in graph:\\n\\tfor neigh in graph[guy]:\\n\\t\\tif components[guy] == components[neigh[0]] and neigh[1] == b:\\n\\t\\t\\tuseless.append((guy, neigh))\\nfor guy in useless:\\n\\tgraph[guy[0]].remove(guy[1])\\ncounts = [0] * (comp + 1)\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\tcounts[components[i]] += 1\\nbad = []\\nfor i in range(comp + 1):\\n\\tif counts[i] <= 3:\\n\\t\\tbad.append(i)\\n\\t\\tfor j in range(n):\\n\\t\\t\\tif components[j] == i:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomponents[j] = -1\\nfor guy in bad[::-1]:\\n\\tfor i in range(n):\\n\\t\\tif components[i] > guy:\\n\\t\\t\\tcomponents[i] -= 1\\ncomp -= len(bad)\\ncomp += 1\\ndists = [[float('inf') for i in range(2 ** comp)] for j in range(n)]\\ndists[0][0] = 0\\npq = []\\nheapq.heappush(pq, [0, 0, 0])\\nremaining = n\\nvisited = [0] * n\\nwhile len(pq) > 0 and remaining > 0:\\n\\t(dist, vert, mask) = heapq.heappop(pq)\\n\\tif visited[vert] == 0:\\n\\t\\tvisited[vert] = 1\\n\\t\\tremaining -= 1\\n\\tfor neigh in graph[vert]:\\n\\t\\tif neigh[1] == b:\\n\\t\\t\\tif components[vert] == components[neigh[0]] and components[vert] != -1:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontinue\\n\\t\\t\\tif components[neigh[0]] != -1:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif mask & 2 ** components[neigh[0]] > 0:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcontinue\\n\\t\\t\\tif components[vert] != -1:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaskn = mask + 2 ** components[vert]\\n\\t\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaskn = mask\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tmaskn = mask\\n\\t\\tif dist + neigh[1] < dists[neigh[0]][maskn]:\\n\\t\\t\\tdists[neigh[0]][maskn] = dist + neigh[1]\\n\\t\\t\\theapq.heappush(pq, [dist + neigh[1], neigh[0], maskn])\\noptimal = [str(min(dists[i])) for i in range(n)]\\nprint(' '.join(optimal))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The task is to find the minimum time to travel from settlement 1 to each other settlement, given the possibility to remove roads to form a minimum spanning tree. The selection of the MST must also minimize the travel time from settlement 1 to each other settlement.\\n- Identifying Constraints: The number of settlements n is small (up to 70) and the number of roads m is also relatively small (up to 200). The travel times a and b are integers and a < b.\\n- Formulating a Solution Strategy: The problem requires finding a minimum spanning tree (MST) and then finding the shortest paths from settlement 1 to all other settlements using the edges in the MST. Since 'a' is smaller than 'b', we prefer to have edges with weight 'a' in our MST.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Consider edge cases where some settlements might not be reachable from settlement 1 after constructing the MST. In such cases, the distance should be infinity.\\n- Implementing the Solution: Implement a standard MST algorithm such as Prim's or Kruskal's algorithm. After obtaining the MST, use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from settlement 1 to all other settlements.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the key criteria for selecting the roads to abandon, and how does each criterion influence the final MST?\",\n    \"How does the difference between 'a' and 'b' affect the strategy for building the MST, and why is it important to prioritize roads with weight 'a'?\",\n    \"What are the steps to implement Kruskal's algorithm for MST construction, and how can it be adapted to prefer edges with weight 'a'?\",\n    \"After constructing the MST, what is the best approach to calculate the shortest paths from settlement 1 to all other settlements within the MST, and what considerations should be made for unreachable settlements?\",\n    \"How can we efficiently handle cycles while building the MST to ensure connectivity and minimize total cost?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The key criteria are: 1. Connectivity between all settlements, 2. Minimizing the total weight of the remaining roads (MST), and 3. Minimizing the travel time from settlement 1 to each other settlement. The MST ensures minimum total weight, while the third criterion might lead to a different MST if multiple MSTs exist.\",\n    \"Since a < b, edges with weight 'a' should be prioritized to minimize the total MST weight. The MST should primarily consist of roads with weight 'a'. If using Prim's algorithm, start exploring 'a' edges before 'b' edges. If using Kruskal's, sort edges with 'a' first.\",\n    \"1. Sort the edges by weight in increasing order (prioritizing 'a'). 2. Initialize a disjoint set data structure to track connected components. 3. Iterate through the sorted edges: if adding the edge doesn't create a cycle (i.e., the two nodes belong to different components), add it to the MST and merge the two components. 4. Continue until all nodes are connected or all edges are processed.\",\n    \"Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to find the shortest paths. Initialize distances to infinity, set distance[1] = 0. Use a priority queue to explore nodes in increasing order of distance. If a settlement is unreachable, its distance will remain infinity.\",\n    \"Cycles can be detected using a disjoint-set data structure. If the endpoints of an edge already belong to the same set, adding the edge would create a cycle, and should be skipped.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
