The chessboard is painted like this: \\\"BWBW...BW\\\".\\n\\nSome cells of the board are occupied by the chess pieces. Each cell contains no more than one chess piece. It is known that the total number of pieces equals to $\\\\frac{n}{2}$.\\n\\nIn one step you can move one of the pieces one cell to the left or to the right. You cannot move pieces beyond the borders of the board. You also cannot move pieces to the cells that are already occupied.\\n\\nYour task is to place all the pieces in the cells of the same color using the minimum number of moves (all the pieces must occupy only the black cells or only the white cells after all the moves are made).\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line of the input contains one integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100, n is even) \u2014 the size of the chessboard. \\n\\nThe second line of the input contains $\\\\frac{n}{2}$ integer numbers $p_{1}, p_{2}, \\\\ldots, p_{\\\\frac{n}{2}}$ (1 \u2264 p_{i} \u2264 n) \u2014 initial positions of the pieces.

A possible approach is to sort the initial piece positions and calculate the moves for each scenario. The formula for the target positions can be generalized based on whether we want to align them to the black or white cells.\\n- Optimization Considerations: Realize that the positions need to be adjacent to minimize moves. Sorting the input array makes it easier to calculate minimal moves to black and white positions.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the constraints on moving the pieces (direction, board boundaries, overlapping pieces)?\",\n    \"How would you determine the optimal final positions for the pieces to minimize the total moves?\",\n    \"How can you calculate the number of moves required to place the pieces on all black cells versus all white cells?\",\n    \"Given the need to check both black and white cell placements, how can you choose the best approach?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Pieces can only move one cell to the left or right. They cannot move beyond the chessboard boundaries or onto cells already occupied by another piece.\",\n    \"To minimize the number of moves, you should aim for the pieces to occupy consecutive cells of the same color. This suggests sorting the pieces' initial positions can help calculate minimal moves.\",\n    \"For placing pieces on black cells, the target positions would be 1, 3, 5, etc.  For placing pieces on white cells, the target positions would be 2, 4, 6, etc. Calculate the sum of the absolute differences between each piece's starting position and its target position for both scenarios.\",\n    \"Calculate the total moves needed for aligning all pieces to black cells and all pieces to white cells.
