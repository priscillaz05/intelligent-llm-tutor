The goal is to minimize the maximum of $a$ and $b$.\\n- Identify Key Relationships: The relationship between two numbers and their LCM and greatest common divisor (GCD) can be expressed as $LCM(a, b) * GCD(a, b) = a * b$.\\n- Algorithm Selection: We can iterate through potential divisors $i$ of $X$. For each divisor, check if $LCM(i, X/i) == X$. If true, the pair ($i, X/i$) satisfies the condition.  Since we want to minimize $max(a,b)$, we should start from the square root of $X$ and go downwards.\\n- Implementation Details: We need to find the square root of $X$ as the starting point of the loop. If $X$ is 1, the answer is (1,1).\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the relationship between LCM, GCD, and the two numbers a and b?\",\n    \"How can we determine a good starting point for finding factors of X that will help minimize max(a, b)?\",\n    \"What edge cases should be considered, and how should they be handled?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The relationship is LCM(a, b) * GCD(a, b) = a * b.\",\n    \"Start from the square root of X and iterate downwards.  This approach ensures that the first pair (a, b) we find will have the minimum possible max(a, b).\",\n    \"If X is 1, then a and b should both be 1. Also, consider cases where the calculated LCM of i and X/i does not equal X, in which case we continue to the next potential divisor.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
