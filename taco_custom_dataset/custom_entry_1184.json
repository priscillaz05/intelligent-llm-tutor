And if you aren't familiar, help the kid, anyway.\\n\\nNow Abed has been told by Britta that she's going to marry Jeff, and that has freaked him out. He thinks their study group will no longer be able to stay intact anymore. Abed wants to use his weird super-power to move across coordinates to reach the desired time-line where everyone is together. \\n\\nFrom the current coordinate, Abed can go to a cell which is vertically, or horizontally adjacent to it. As we know, every story has a twist: if you're on the rightmost cell, moving right from it will move you to the leftmost cell. And vice versa - for the left move from the leftmost cell will lead you to the rightmost cell. If you move down from the most bottom cell, it will lead you to the corresponding top cell, and vice versa for the top cell, too.\\n\\nAnyway, everyone gets one chance, Abed has got one, too. He has exactly \\\"1000\\\"  time-line coins, which he can use to travel across various time-lines. These time-lines are represented as N rows and M columns. For every move, there's a constant price attached to it, and no matter whatever move you make, you have to pay that price. Obviously, if that price exceeds 1000, Abed will not be able to travel any further, and his group will not be saved. Otherwise, if he can travel from the time-line he's in, to the one he's supposed to go to in less than or equal to 1000 coins, the group will be saved.\\n\\nEach cell of a matrix is a unique time-line. Also, each time-line is uniquely defined by two variables, x and y. Given a coordinate x1, y1,  he would have to go to x2, y2 - and for every move, there'll be a price *p * associated as well. \\n\\nInput format:\\nThe first line contains the number of test cases, following which two numbers N, and M denoting the number of rows and columns. For every pair of row and column, you need to input the initial coordinates of Abed, the final coordinates where he needs to reach, and the price of every move in that unique matrix.\\n\\nOutput format:\\nPrint the final cost incurred. And \\\"Let go of the group.\\\" if the cost is above 1000, or \\\"You saved the group.\\\", if he manages to do it under 1000.\\n\\nConstraints:\\n1 \u2264 tc \u2264 10\\n1 \u2264 N, M \u2264 10^6\\n0 \u2264 x1, x2 \u2264 N-1\\n0 \u2264 y1, y2 \u2264 M-1\\n1 \u2264 p \u2264 10SAMPLE INPUT\\n1\\n4 4\\n3 0\\n2 2\\n9\\n\\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\\n27\\nYou saved the group.\\n\\nExplanation\\n\\nTotal number of moves = number of moves to walk along rows  + number of moves to walk along column.\\n\\nNote that, These two distances are independent. So, we can handle them individually. \\nAlso, to reach from a row to another row OR from a column to another column there are two ways:\\n1) Go directly i.e abs(x1-x2) where we are going from row x1 to row x2.\\n2) Use the wrapped around matrix. abs(n-x1-x2) i.e we will move through all the blocks except which connects them directly.\\n\\nWe take the minimum of two to get the minimum moves to reach there.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"no_test_cases = eval(input())\\n\\ndef wrapped_distance(x1, x2, limit):\\n\\tif x1 > x2:\\n\\t\\treturn abs(limit - x1) + x2\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\treturn abs(limit - x2) + x1\\n\\nfor _ in range(no_test_cases):\\n\\trow, column = [int(x) for x in (input().split(' '))]\\n\\tx1, y1 = [int(x) for x in (input().split(' '))]\\n\\tx2, y2 = [int(x) for x in (input().split(' '))]\\n\\n\\tcost = eval(input())\\n\\n\\tsteps = min(abs(x1 - x2), wrapped_distance(x1, x2, row)) + min(abs(y1 - y2), wrapped_distance(y1, y2, column))\\n\\n\\tprint((cost * steps))\\n\\n\\tif cost * steps < 1000:\\n\\t\\tprint('You saved the group.')\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tprint('Let go of the group.')\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem describes Abed's need to travel between timelines represented as cells in a grid.  The grid has wrap-around properties: moving past an edge brings you to the opposite edge. Abed has a limited budget (1000 coins), and the goal is to determine if he can reach his destination timeline within that budget, given the cost per move.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints: The main constraints are the wrap-around grid, the maximum budget of 1000, and the cost per move.  The grid size can be up to 10^6 x 10^6, but coordinates x1, x2 are always within the grid dimensions.\\n- Choosing an Algorithm: The core idea is to calculate the minimum number of moves needed to travel between two points, considering the wrap-around. This involves calculating the distance both directly and through the wrap-around, and taking the minimum.  Then, multiply the number of moves by the cost per move and check if it exceeds 1000.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: The coordinates can be the same, in which case the number of moves is 0. No need for specific exception handling, but consider large grid sizes when minimizing direct vs wrapped distance.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you calculate the distance between two points in a wrap-around grid?\",\n    \"How do you handle the budget constraint and determine if Abed can reach his destination?\",\n    \"What edge cases or special conditions should be considered, and how do they impact the solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"To calculate the distance in a wrap-around grid, calculate both the direct distance and the wrapped distance. The wrapped distance is calculated by moving to the edge and then moving from the opposite edge. The minimum of these two distances represents the shortest path between the points.\",\n    \"To handle the budget constraint, multiply the minimum number of moves by the cost per move. If the total cost is less than or equal to 1000, Abed can reach his destination. Otherwise, he cannot.\",\n    \"The case where the starting and ending coordinates are the same, resulting in zero moves. Also consider potential integer overflow for very large input value or cost when computing `cost * steps` (although the prompt constraints limit this). Ensure no negative number calculations are performed, especially with distance calculations using `abs()`.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
