As the name tells, letters are sold in the shop.\\n\\nLetters are sold one by one from the leftmost to the rightmost. Any customer can only buy some prefix of letters from the string s.\\n\\nThere are m friends, the i-th of them is named t_i. Each of them is planning to estimate the following value: how many letters (the length of the shortest prefix) would s/he need to buy if s/he wanted to construct her/his name of bought letters.

This allows quick lookup of character positions.\\n- Processing Each Friend's Name `t`: For each friend, iterate through their name, count the frequency of each character, and find the maximum index of each character required to form the name.  The maximum of these indices + 1 gives the shortest prefix length.\\n- Optimizations/Edge Cases: The problem statement guarantees that every friend can construct their name, so we don't need to handle cases where a name can't be formed.

This allows for O(1) average time complexity for retrieving character indices.\",\n    \"For each character in the friend's name, find the maximum index among all occurrences of that character needed to satisfy the required count. The maximum of all these indices + 1 will be the required prefix length.\",\n    \"A defaultdict(int) is suitable because it automatically initializes the count of each character to zero. This eliminates the need to check if a character already exists in the dictionary before incrementing its count. Also, dictionaries provide efficient access for counting character frequency.\",\n    \"The problem statement guarantees that all names can be formed using the characters in the showcase string. Therefore, you don't need to handle cases where a character in the friend's name is not present in the showcase string.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
