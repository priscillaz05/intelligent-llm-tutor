Adding more of other letters will not change this number.  We can try to add repetitions to the original FESTIVAL string to increase the number of subsequences, or we can add some other characters that don't affect it. A greedy algorithm can create the desired string by appending extra 'L's intelligently.\\n- Edge Cases and Optimizations: Consider edge cases where K is 1 (simply output \\\"FESTIVAL\\\").

Unlike a substring, the elements in a subsequence do not need to be contiguous.\",\n    \"We can start with \\\"FESTIVAL\\\" and then strategically insert other letters or repeat some letters. A good approach is to add only L and find optimal number of each 'L' to add to get the required number of subsequences. \",\n    \"Yes, we can. By repeating letters, specifically 'L', we are creating more subsequences\",\n    \"The base case is K=1, for which the string is \\\"FESTIVAL\\\".  Then we build up adding 'L's and check to reach K subsequences.\",\n    \"The length constraint requires us to be efficient in how we construct the string. We cannot just naively add any character. Therefore, an iterative approach where we incrementally refine the string is needed.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
