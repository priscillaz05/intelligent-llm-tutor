The point $P$ is not moving, while $Q$ is moving in a straight line with constant velocity. You are also given a direction vector $d$ with the following meaning: the position of $Q$ at time $t$ is $Q(t) = Q(0) + d \\cdot t$, where $Q(0)$ is the initial position of $Q$. It is guaranteed that $Q$ is not visible from $P$ initially (at time $t=0$). It is also guaranteed that $P$ and $Q$ do not touch the sphere at any time.\\nFind the smallest positive time $t_v$ when $Q$ is visible from $P$, i.e. when the line segment connecting points $P$ and $Q$ does not intersect the sphere.\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.

The position of Q changes over time as Q(t) = Q(0) + d*t.\\n- Representing the Visibility Condition: The visibility condition means the line segment between P and Q(t) does not intersect the sphere. This condition can be represented mathematically using the distance between the line and the center of the sphere. If the minimum distance between the line PQ(t) and the center of the sphere is greater than the radius, then P and Q(t) are visible to each other.\\n- Formulating the Distance Calculation: The distance between a point and a line in 3D space can be calculated. The problem requires formulating a general equation that gives the distance from the center of the sphere to the line segment PQ(t) and finding when it exceeds the radius r.\\n- Solving the Quadratic Equation: The condition of non-intersection can be translated to solving an inequality. This inequality eventually boils down to finding the roots of a quadratic equation related to time t. Analyzing the roots of this quadratic gives us the earliest time at which P and Q(t) become visible.\\n- Handling Edge Cases and Special Conditions: Check corner cases like when A = 0 in the quadratic formula, which means you have a linear rather than quadratic equation to solve. Also, be careful to select only positive times since the problem requires the smallest positive time.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you define the position of point Q at any given time t, based on the provided inputs?\",\n    \"What geometric condition determines when point Q becomes visible from point P?\",\n    \"How can the distance between a line segment PQ(t) and the center of the sphere be formulated mathematically?\",\n    \"What kind of equation arises when translating the visibility condition into an inequality, and how does it relate to time?\",\n    \"What edge cases or special conditions need to be considered, and how do they affect the selection of the appropriate time t?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The position of point Q at time t is defined as Q(t) = Q(0) + d * t, where Q(0) is the initial position of Q and d is the direction vector.\",\n    \"Point Q becomes visible from point P when the line segment connecting P and Q(t) does not intersect the sphere.
