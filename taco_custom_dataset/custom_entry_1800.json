For example, if $A = 3$, $B = 3$ and $C = 3$, then $S = \\{1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3\\}$.\\n\\nYour goal is to divide the elements of $S$ into two groups (multisets); each element of $S$ must be in exactly one of these groups and the sum of elements of one group must be equal to the sum of elements of the other group. In our example, it is possible to make the groups $\\{1, 1, 2, 2, 3\\}$ and $\\{1, 2, 3, 3\\}$; the sum of elements of each group is $9$.\\n\\nDetermine if it is possible to make such groups.\\n\\n------  Input ------\\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.

For the division to be possible, this sum must be even.\\n- Determine the Condition for Equal Sums: If the total sum is even, it is always possible to divide the multiset into two groups with equal sums. If the total sum is odd, it is impossible.\\n- Check Parity of A, B, and C: The parity (even or odd) of A, B, and C determines the parity of the total sum (A + 2B + 3C). Since 2B is always even, its parity doesn't affect the final sum. The total sum parity depends on the parity of A + 3C. Since 3C has the same parity as C, the problem simplifies to checking the parity of A + C.\\n- Simplify Parity Condition: The sum A + C is even if and only if A and C have the same parity (both even or both odd). Therefore, if A and C have the same parity, the total sum A + 2B + 3C will also have the same parity as A+C+2B, which would be even. If A and C have different parity, the total sum will be odd.\\n- Further Simplify: Note that since the total sum has to be even, then the entire solution boils down to (A + 2B + 3C) % 2 == 0, but since 2B is always even, it is equivalent to (A + 3C) % 2 == 0 and since 3C has the same parity of C, it is equivalent to (A + C) % 2 == 0.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you determine if a multiset can be divided into two groups with equal sums?\",\n    \"How does the parity (even or odd) of A, B, and C affect the possibility of dividing the multiset?\",\n    \"How can you simplify the condition based on the parity of A, B, and C to determine the outcome?\",\n    \"What is the role of 'B' in determining if the multiset can be divided into two equal sum groups?\",\n    \"How would you efficiently check if dividing the multiset into two groups with equal sums is feasible without enumerating all possible combinations?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"You need to calculate the total sum of the multiset.
