The goal is to determine the expected number of operations needed to transform an initial value X (initially 0) into each possible target value i, where each operation involves XORing X with a newly generated random number. The result must be computed modulo 998244353.\\n- Identifying Key Concepts and Techniques: The problem requires understanding of expected value, bitwise XOR operations, and modular arithmetic. Crucially, it involves using the Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform (FWHT) for efficient computation. The problem can be modeled as a system of linear equations, which can be solved using FWHT.\\n- Selecting Appropriate Algorithm and Data Structures: FWHT is a suitable technique because XOR convolution can be computed efficiently using it. The probabilities are represented by the array A. The expected number of operations for each state can be calculated by transforming the problem into the frequency domain using FWHT, solving a system of equations, and then transforming back.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Ensure correct implementation of FWHT including normalization. Perform all arithmetic operations modulo 998244353.
