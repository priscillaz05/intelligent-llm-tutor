Note that toggling a row or column means flipping all 0s to 1s and vice versa.\\n- Strategy for Maximization: Realize that to maximize the score, we should aim to have the most significant bit (leftmost bit) of each row as 1. After ensuring that, we should consider toggling columns to maximize the number of 1s in each subsequent column.\\n- Handling Row Toggling: Ensure that the leftmost bit of each row is 1. If not, toggle the entire row.\\n- Handling Column Toggling: After ensuring all leftmost bits are 1, iterate through the columns (starting from the second column). For each column, count the number of 0s and 1s. If there are more 0s than 1s, toggle the entire column.\\n- Calculating the Score: Convert each row to its decimal equivalent (binary number) and sum these values to get the final score.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does toggling a row or column affect the binary number it represents?\",\n    \"Why is it important to make the leftmost bit of each row equal to 1?\",\n    \"After ensuring that all leftmost bits are 1, how would you decide whether to toggle a particular column?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the decimal value of a binary row?\",\n    \"What are the constraints on the input, and how do they affect the algorithm's complexity?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Toggling a row or column flips all 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s. This means that if a row represents a smaller binary number, toggling it could potentially increase its value.\",\n    \"The leftmost bit has the highest weight (2^(n-1)), so setting it to 1 ensures a large contribution to the overall score. By making the leftmost bit 1 for all rows, we maximize the overall sum.\",\n    \"After ensuring all leftmost bits are 1, check each column. If the number of 0s in a column is greater than the number of 1s, toggle the column to increase the total number of 1s in that column, which leads to a higher score.\",\n    \"The decimal value of a binary row can be calculated by multiplying each bit by its corresponding power of 2 (from right to left, starting with 2^0) and summing the results.
