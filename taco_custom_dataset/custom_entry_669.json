Javad's year has N months, each with a specified number of days. Years divisible by 4 are leap years, with the last month having one extra day.\\n- Handling Input and Edge Cases: Need to parse the input correctly, including number of months, days in each month, birth date, and current date. Important to handle cases where the birth year and current year are the same, or when they are different.\\n- Calculating Days: For the same year, calculate the difference in days directly or sum days in between months. For different years, calculate the remaining days in the birth year, full days in intermediate years, and days passed in the current year. Remember to account for leap years during intermediate years calculation.\\n- Leap Year Condition: Determine whether a year is a leap year and appropriately add the extra day to the last month of the year.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you calculate the total number of days between two dates when they fall within the same year?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the total number of days between two dates when they fall in different years?\",\n    \"How do you determine if a year is a leap year on planet Javad, and how do you account for the extra day?\",\n    \"How do you efficiently sum the days in a range of months given the number of days in each month?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases to consider to ensure the solution is correct across all possible inputs?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"If the birth and current years are the same, and the birth and current months are the same, the age in days is simply the difference between the current day and the birth day plus one. If the months are different, sum the remaining days of the birth month, all full months between the birth and current month, and the days passed in the current month.\",\n    \"If the birth and current years are different, you need to sum the remaining days of the birth year, the total days in each full year between the birth and current year, and the days passed in the current year.\",\n    \"A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4. If a year is a leap year, the last month of the year has an additional day (a_N + 1). You need to add one day to the total count for each leap year between the birth and current years.\",\n    \"You can use the sum() function on a slice of the month array to efficiently sum the days in a range of months.\",\n    \"Edge cases include: when the birth year and current year are the same, birth and current dates are the same, years are adjacent and there may or may not be a leap year, all ai are 1, or N = 1.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
