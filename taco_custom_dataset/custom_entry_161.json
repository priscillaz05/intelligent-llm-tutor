"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"Bawris, are wells or ponds in which the water may be reached by descending a set of steps. They may be covered and protected and are often of architectural significance. \\n\\nRajasthan has a history of maintaining bawris, but now they are of architectural significance hence ASI is interested to save a historic bawris from ACID rain. Hence they need to cover each and every bawri with a plank in order to prevent any direct damage to the bawri, so you are given a certain number of planks with different sizes (all rectangular), you are also given the sizes of all the bawris which are also rectangular in shape.\\n\\nYou have to tell whether it is possible to cover the bawri with the given plank while following these rules :\\nYou may rotate the plank, but you must place it so that the sides of the plank are parallel to the sides of the bawri.\\nPlank must cover the whole bawri\\nEvery corner of the plank must be strictly outside the bawri, i.e. boundaries of plank and bawri cannot match as acid rain water can peep inside.\\n\\nInput:\\nFirst line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases, which is followed by T number of lines.\\n\\nEach line denotes one test case which has four space separated integers pX pY bX bY which are plank's length & width and bawri's length & width respectively.\\n\\nOutput:\\nFor each test case, you have to output in one line either \\\"Possible\\\" if it is possible to cover the bawri with the given plank otherwise print \\\"Not Possible\\\" (Quotes are for clarity)\\n\\nConstraint:\\n\\n100 \u2264 T \u2264 10,000\\n1 \u2264 bX, bY, pX, pY \u2264 1000\\n\\nSAMPLE INPUT\\n3\\n2 7 4 7\\n5 2 3 1\\n9 2 7 1\\n\\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\\nNot Possible\\nPossible\\nPossible\\n\\nExplanation\\n\\nSample Test Case #1 :\\n\\nIt is impossible to cover up a bawri of size (4 X 7) with the given plank of size (2 X 7).\\n\\nSample Test Case #2 :\\n\\nIt is possible to cover up the bawri with the given plank.\\n\\nSample Test Case #3 :\\n\\nAs in the case #2\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"for tc in range(eval(input())):\\n\\tpx,py,bx,by=list(map(int,input().split()))\\n\\tif (px>=bx and py>=by) or (px>=by and py>=bx):\\n\\t\\tprint('Possible')\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tprint('Not Possible')\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding Problem Constraints: The problem requires determining if a rectangular bawri can be covered by a rectangular plank, considering plank rotation and strict coverage (plank dimensions must be strictly larger). The goal is to output 'Possible' or 'Not Possible' for each test case.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: The major pitfall is overlooking the strict coverage rule, meaning the plank must be strictly larger in both dimensions, not just equal. Another pitfall is not considering the rotation of the plank.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: The strategy should involve checking if either orientation of the plank is large enough to cover the bawri while adhering to the problem constraints. Both orientations of the plank need to be considered: plank length >= bawri length AND plank width >= bawri width, OR plank length >= bawri width AND plank width >= bawri length.\\n- Implementation Considerations: The implementation requires handling multiple test cases. Input parsing and conditional statements should handle the checks efficiently.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does 'strict coverage' mean in the context of this problem, and how does it affect the comparison between plank and bawri dimensions?\",\n    \"How does the allowance to rotate the plank simplify the solution approach, and what alternative configurations must be considered?\",\n    \"What is the significance of considering all test cases provided in the input?\",\n    \"What conditions must be satisfied for a plank to be considered a suitable cover for the bawri, accounting for both dimensions and the possibility of rotation?\",\n    \"How can the conditional checks be efficiently implemented to determine the 'Possible' or 'Not Possible' result for each test case?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Strict coverage means that both dimensions of the plank must be strictly greater than the corresponding dimensions of the bawri; equality is not enough. This means we need to check if the plank's length is greater than the bawri's length AND the plank's width is greater than the bawri's width, or if the plank's length is greater than the bawri's width AND the plank's width is greater than the bawri's length.\",\n    \"The possibility to rotate the plank means we only have to check if the plank's dimensions in either orientation are large enough to cover the bawri. We must consider two possible orientations for the plank and check if either satisfies the covering condition.\",\n    \"The input provides multiple test cases, each representing a different plank and bawri size combination. Each test case must be evaluated independently and the result should be determined individually for each case.\",\n    \"For a plank to cover the bawri, either plank length >= bawri length AND plank width >= bawri width, OR plank length >= bawri width AND plank width >= bawri length must be true.\",\n    \"The conditional checks can be implemented with 'if' statements, evaluating both the original and rotated configurations of the plank. If either configuration satisfies the coverage criteria, the result is 'Possible'; otherwise, the result is 'Not Possible'.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
