The length of a string is the number of symbols in it. For example, the length of 111000 is 6. If u and v are strings, then uv is the string obtained by concatenating u and v. For example if u = 110 and v = 0010 then uv = 1100010.\\nA string w is periodic if there exists a string v such that w = vn = vv \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 v (n times), for some n \u2265 2. Note that in this case the length of v is strictly less than that of w. For example, 110110 is periodic, because it is vv for v = 110.\\nGiven a positive integer N , find the number of strings of length N which are not periodic. Report the answer modulo M . The non-periodic strings of length 2 are 10 and 01.

A periodic string is defined as a string that can be formed by repeating a shorter string v at least twice (vn for n >= 2).\\n- Identifying a Solution Strategy: The total number of strings of length N is 2^N. We need to subtract the number of periodic strings from this total. The inclusion-exclusion principle can be used to count the number of periodic strings, considering the divisors of N.\\n- Applying Inclusion-Exclusion Principle: Iterate through all divisors of N (excluding N itself). For each divisor d, the number of strings with period d is 2^d. The inclusion-exclusion principle helps avoid overcounting strings that have multiple periods (e.g., a string with period 2 also has period 4).\\n- Implementing the Solution: First, compute all divisors of N. Then, for each divisor d, calculate 2^d. Apply the inclusion-exclusion principle to calculate the number of periodic strings. Finally, subtract this count from 2^N and take the modulo M.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the definition of a periodic string, and why is it important to identify them correctly in this problem?\",\n    \"How can we find all possible periods of a string of length N, and how are these related to the divisors of N?\",\n    \"Can you explain how the inclusion-exclusion principle is applied in this context to avoid overcounting periodic strings?\",\n    \"Given a specific period d, how many distinct strings of length N can be formed by repeating a string of length d?\",\n    \"How do we efficiently calculate the divisors of N, especially given the constraint on N?\",\n    \"How can we compute 2^n modulo m efficiently?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A periodic string is a string that can be formed by repeating a shorter string 'v' at least twice (w = v^n, n >= 2).
