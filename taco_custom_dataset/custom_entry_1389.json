The string should be lexicographically smallest, implying we should use 'a' as much as possible, then 'b', and so on.\\n- Devising a Strategy: A string of 'a's will have n(n+1)/2 palindromic substrings. Thus, we can find a number of 'a's to use, such that n(n+1)/2 is closest to K without exceeding it. If K is larger than n(n+1)/2, we will need to include other characters such as 'b' and potentially 'c' and onwards. The aim is to minimize the number of additional characters.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Consider the cases where K is small (e.g., 1, 2, 3) and large (e.g., close to the upper bound). Special consideration might be needed for very large K values where precision in calculation becomes important. Specific cases like k=5 and k=8 have hardcoded solutions, probably because of some edge case.\\n- Optimizing for Lexicographical Order: The goal is to minimize the usage of letters other than 'a'. We will try to include the largest number of 'a's possible and then include a minimal number of 'b's and 'c's to reach K.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How does the number of palindromic substrings relate to the length of a string consisting of only one character (e.g., 'a')?\",\n    \"If K is greater than n(n+1)/2, how do you determine the minimum number of additional characters required to achieve exactly K palindromic substrings?\",\n    \"What are some edge cases to consider when K is very small or very large?\",\n    \"Given that the string should be lexicographically smallest, in what order should you introduce other characters (like 'b', 'c', etc.)?\",\n    \"Are there any specific values of K that might require special handling or precomputed results (e.g., as suggested by the provided ground truth solution)?\",\n    \"How to choose the number of a's to minimize the addition of other characters to exactly reach K?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"For a string of length n consisting of only one character, the number of palindromic substrings is n(n+1)/2.\",\n    \"You need to consider introducing characters like 'b' or 'c'. You want to find the combination that results in K palindromic substrings while minimizing the string length. A substring of 'b's will have m(m+1)/2 palindromes. It's an iterative process of maximizing substrings of 'a's, then 'b's, and then 'c's until you reach K.\",\n    \"For small K (e.g., 1, 2, 3), the lengths are 1, 2, and 2 respectively.

This suggests there may be some special values of K that warrant specific hardcoded solutions.\",\n    \"Select the highest number n, such that n(n+1)/2 is <= K.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
