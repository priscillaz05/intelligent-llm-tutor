The input includes the dictionary (list of strings), the number of words N, and the number of distinct characters K.\\n- Identifying Constraints: The dictionary is sorted, which is crucial because it implies that if word1 appears before word2, the first differing character in word1 must come before the corresponding character in word2 in the alien alphabet.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: This problem can be modeled as a graph problem where the characters are nodes, and the edges represent the precedence relationship (e.g., 'a' -> 'b' means 'a' comes before 'b'). A topological sort of this graph gives the order of characters. Building the graph involves comparing adjacent words in the dictionary to find the character precedence. Handling cycles is important (though not explicitly stated in the prompt, it is good practice).\\n- Topological Sort: Use Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting. This involves finding nodes (characters) with no incoming edges (in-degree of 0). Add these to a queue and then, iteratively, remove nodes from the queue, add them to the sorted order, and decrement the in-degree of their neighbors. Add neighbors to the queue when their in-degree becomes 0.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can the sorted order of the dictionary be used to determine the order of characters in the alien language?\",\n    \"How can you represent the relationships between characters as a graph, and why is this representation useful?\",\n    \"Which algorithm could be used to determine the order of the characters after the relationships are established? What are the key steps of that algorithm?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases or error conditions that should be considered? For example, are there any circumstances where a valid order cannot be determined?\",\n    \"How is topological sorting impacted by the possibility of cycles, and what measures can you take to handle this scenario?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Since the dictionary is sorted, the relative order of the words tells us about the order of the characters. By comparing consecutive words, the first differing characters between them establish a precedence relationship in the alien alphabet.\",\n    \"The characters can be represented as nodes in a directed graph. An edge from character 'a' to 'b' indicates that 'a' must come before 'b' in the alien language. This representation is helpful because it allows us to use topological sorting to determine the character order.\",\n    \"Kahn's algorithm is a valid algorithm for topological sorting. It involves computing in-degrees, adding nodes with in-degree 0 to a queue, removing nodes from the queue, adding them to the sorted order, and decrementing the in-degrees of their neighbors.\",\n    \"Cycles in the dependency graph would indicate contradictory relationships between characters, which would make it impossible to determine a valid order. Also, the possibility of an empty input or an incomplete alphabet.\",\n    \"Cycles in the graph mean that a valid topological order does not exist. In such cases, the algorithm should detect the cycle and return an appropriate error indication, for example, by verifying if all the nodes got into the topological order.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
