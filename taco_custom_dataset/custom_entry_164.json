The first integer indicates how many pairs of numbers follow. The first of each pair is A, the base number, and the second is E, the power of 10.\\n\\n-----Output:-----\\nRound each answer to 2 decimal places. Trailing zeros to the right of the decimal point are required. A leading zero to the left of the decimal point is not required.\\nThe output is to be formatted exactly like that for the sample output given below.\\n\\n-----Assumptions:-----\\nE is in the range \u201310 .. 10. A is 1 or larger but less than 10.\\nDiscussion: \\nIf A = 3.926 and E = 4, the number represented is 3.926 X 104 or 39260, which is 39260.00 when rounded to 2 decimal places.\\n\\n-----Sample Input:-----\\n4 4.296 3 3.8 -2 1.8 2 2.8678 1\\n\\n-----Sample Output:-----\\n4296.00\\n0.04\\n180.00\\n28.68\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import math\\nx = input().split()\\nn = int(x[0])\\narr = []\\ni = 1\\nwhile i < len(x):\\n\\tarr.append(float(x[i]))\\n\\ti += 1\\n\\tarr.append(int(x[i]))\\n\\ti += 1\\ni = 0\\nans = []\\nwhile i < len(arr):\\n\\tx = arr[i]\\n\\ti += 1\\n\\ty = arr[i]\\n\\ty = 10 ** y\\n\\ti += 1\\n\\tans.append(x * y)\\nfor i in range(len(ans)):\\n\\tprint('{:.2f}'.format(ans[i]))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Input Format: Recognize that the input is a single line containing the number of pairs (A, E) followed by the pairs themselves, where A is a float and E is an integer.\\n- Parsing the Input: Split the input string into a list of strings and then process the list to extract the number of pairs and the (A, E) values.\\n- Calculating Decimal Values: For each (A, E) pair, calculate the decimal value by multiplying A by 10 raised to the power of E.\\n- Formatting the Output: Format each calculated decimal value to 2 decimal places, ensuring trailing zeros are included if needed, and print each value on a new line.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you handle the initial integer that specifies the number of (A, E) pairs?\",\n    \"How do you convert the input string into usable numeric values (float for A and integer for E)?\",\n    \"What is the formula for converting a number from scientific notation (A, E) to its decimal equivalent?\",\n    \"How do you ensure that the output is formatted to exactly 2 decimal places, including trailing zeros?\",\n    \"How do you handle potential errors during input parsing or calculation (e.g., invalid input formats)?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The initial integer tells me how many subsequent pairs of numbers to process.
