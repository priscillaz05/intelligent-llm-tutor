The binary representation of 0 is \\\"0\\\", and its complement is \\\"1\\\", which is 1 in decimal.\\n- Binary Conversion: Convert the given number N to its binary representation. The `bin()` function in Python can be used for this. The binary string starts with \\\"0b\\\", which should be removed.\\n- Complement Calculation: Determine the length of the binary string (excluding the \\\"0b\\\" prefix). Create a mask of all 1s with the same length as the binary string. For example, if the binary string is \\\"101\\\", the mask should be \\\"111\\\".\\n- Bitwise XOR: Perform a bitwise XOR operation between the original number N and the mask to get the complement.\\n- Result: Return the resulting value after the bitwise XOR operation.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the complement of a binary representation, and how does it relate to the given problem?\",\n    \"How would you handle the edge case where the input number N is 0?\",\n    \"How can you convert a decimal number to its binary representation in Python, and what is the format of the binary string returned by the built-in function?\",\n    \"How can you create a mask of all 1s with the same length as the binary representation of the input number?\",\n    \"What bitwise operation can you use to find the complement, and how does it work?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The complement of a binary representation is obtained by changing every 1 to 0 and every 0 to 1.
