Recognize that K represents the number of digits and X is the divisor.\\n- Identifying Edge Cases: Consider the case where 10^(K-1) is divisible by X; if it is, then that is the smallest K-digit number. Otherwise, we need to find the next multiple of X.\\n- Selecting an Algorithm: The smallest K-digit number is 10^(K-1). Find the smallest number >= 10^(K-1) that is divisible by X.\\n- Implementing the Solution: Calculate 10^(K-1). If it is divisible by X, return that. If not, calculate the remainder when 10^(K-1) is divided by X. Then, the smallest K-digit number divisible by X will be 10^(K-1) + (X - (10^(K-1) % X)).\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean to find the smallest K-digit number divisible by X?\",\n    \"What is the smallest K-digit number in general?\",\n    \"How do you check if a number is divisible by X?\",\n    \"How do you find the next multiple of X after a given number?\",\n    \"What are the constraints on X and K, and how do they affect the solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"It means finding a number with exactly K digits that, when divided by X, leaves no remainder.\",\n    \"The smallest K-digit number is 10 raised to the power of (K-1).\",\n    \"A number is divisible by X if the remainder of the number divided by X is zero.\",\n    \"You can add (X - (number % X)) to the number.
