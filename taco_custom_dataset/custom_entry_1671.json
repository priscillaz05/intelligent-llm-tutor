The task is to determine if a given string with 0s, 1s, and ?s can be made k-balanced by replacing ?s with 0s or 1s.\\n- Identifying Constraints: The length of the substring k is even. The string `s` contains only '0', '1', and '?'.\\n- Devising a Strategy: The solution needs to check two conditions. First, whether the existing 0s and 1s in the same position modulo k are consistent. Second, whether the counts of 0s and 1s can be made equal to k/2 within each set of characters at the same position modulo k. If these conditions hold for all groups of characters at the same position modulo k, then the string `s` can be made k-balanced.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: The string length `n` is always greater than or equal to `k` and `k` is always even.\\n- Implementing the Solution: The algorithm iterates through the string `s`. It checks for inconsistencies within each group `s[i % k]`. If no inconsistencies are found, it determines whether it is possible to replace the question marks such that each group of `k` has exactly `k/2` zeros and `k/2` ones.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for a bitstring to be k-balanced?\",\n    \"What are the constraints on the input values n and k?\",\n    \"What strategy would you use to determine if the string can be made k-balanced by replacing question marks?\",\n    \"How can you check for inconsistencies when replacing question marks with 0s or 1s?\",\n    \"How do you handle cases where it is impossible to balance the string within the given constraints?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A bitstring is k-balanced if every substring of length k contains an equal amount of 0 and 1 characters i.e. k/2 of each.\",\n    \"n is the length of the string and k is the parameter for the balanced bitstring, and k is even.  2 <= k <= n <= 3 * 10^5\",\n    \"Iterate through the string and check if all characters at index i % k are consistent with each other, and then verify if each set of such characters can be balanced with an equal number of 0s and 1s.\",\n    \"If a non-question mark character appears at index i and a different non-question mark character appears at index j where i % k == j % k, then an inconsistency exists.\",\n    \"If the counts of 0s and 1s in a group cannot be made equal to k/2, then the string can't be k-balanced, and the output should be 'NO'.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
