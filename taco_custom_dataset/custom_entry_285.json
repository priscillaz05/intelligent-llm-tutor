But with different heights of each step. \\n\\nPictorially the stairs are like this:\\n\\nThe width of each step is same W, but for each stair numbered 'i', the total height of block of with W used for making the step is not uniform.\\n\\nThey used two functions for height Y[x] of each step number x.\\n\\n            1. Y[x] = 2*x and\\n\\n            2. Y[x] = Y[x-1] + 1\\n\\nit's understood that, height of 0th step, floor, Y[0] = 0.\\n\\nSam, being not very good pilot (but an awesome mathematician), was getting bored in his lab, now he wonders if these stairs are to be covered with some royal carpet, what would be the required length of the stair-carpet! (The red part shown in the image!) \\n\\nNow you will we given and array A of function number to be used for ith step. With A[i]=1 or 2. Depending on that value, height of ith step will be calculated.\\n\\nInput:\\n\\nFirst line containing T, the number of test cases.\\n\\nThen T test cases are as follows:\\n\\n    First line containing two Integers W, the width of steps and N, the number of steps.\\n\\n    Next line containing N space separated integers A[1], A[2]...., A[N].\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\n    For each case, print the total length of carpet needed to cover the stairs, on a newline.\\n\\nConstraints:\\n\\n1 \u2264 W \u2264 1000000000\\n\\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 100000\\n\\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\\n\\nSAMPLE INPUT\\n4\\n2 2\\n1 1\\n2 2\\n2 2\\n2 2\\n1 2\\n2 2\\n2 1\\n\\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\\n8\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n\\nExplanation\\n\\nFor case 1:\\n\\n W = 2, N = 2\\n\\n A[] = {1, 1}\\n\\n So, for covering step one, it will take 2 + 2*1 = 4 units and for step no. 2 again, the vertical length to be covered, will be Y[2] - Y[1] =  2*2 - 2*1 ,and width W is also needed, so it's 2+2 = 4. So total length needed is 8.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"for o in range(eval(input())):\\n\\tw,n = list(map(int,input().split()))\\n\\tval = list(map(int,input().split()))\\n\\tans = n*w\\n\\tarr = [0] * (n+1)\\n\\t#print val\\n\\tfor i in range(1,n+1):\\n\\t\\t#print \\\"entered \\\"\\n\\t\\ta = val[i-1]\\n\\t\\t#print a\\n\\t\\tif a==1:\\n\\t\\t\\theight = 2 * i\\n\\t\\telif a==2:\\n\\t\\t\\theight = arr[i-1] + 1\\n\\t\\tarr[i]= height\\n\\t\\tans += arr[i] - arr[i-1]\\n\\tprint(ans)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem asks us to calculate the total length of carpet needed to cover a staircase in Mystery Land, Andromeda. Each step has a width W, and the height of each step is determined by one of two functions. The input provides W, the number of steps N, and an array A indicating which function to use for each step's height.\\n- Identifying Key Formulas: The two height functions are Y[x] = 2*x and Y[x] = Y[x-1] + 1, with Y[0] = 0. We need to calculate the height of each step based on the given A[i].\\n- Calculating Carpet Length: The carpet length for each step is W + the height difference between the current step and the previous step.  The total carpet length will be the sum of W for each step (N * W) plus the sum of the height differences. Specifically, the height difference between step 'i' and step 'i-1'.\\n- Handling Test Cases: The input includes multiple test cases, so we need to iterate through them and perform the calculation for each case separately.\\n- Implementing Height Calculation: Create an array to store the heights of each step. Iterate through the steps, calculate the height using the appropriate function based on the input array A, and store it in the height array.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you calculate the height of each step if A[i] is 1 versus if A[i] is 2?\",\n    \"How do you compute the length of carpet required for each step?\",\n    \"How do you manage multiple test cases in the input?\",\n    \"How do you initialize the height of the 0th step, and how does it affect the overall calculation?\",\n    \"How do you avoid exceeding the time limit given the constraints on W and N?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"If A[i] is 1, the height of step i is 2*i. If A[i] is 2, the height of step i is the height of step i-1 plus 1.\",\n    \"The length of carpet for each step is W (the width) plus the difference in height between the current step and the previous step.\",\n    \"Iterate through each test case in the input, reading the inputs (W, N, and A) for each case, performing the calculation, and printing the result.\",\n    \"The height of the 0th step, Y[0], is given as 0. This serves as the base case for calculating the height of subsequent steps when A[i] is 2.\",\n    \"Given the constraints, an O(N) solution is needed. Calculating heights on-the-fly while accumulating the answer is the most efficient approach.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
