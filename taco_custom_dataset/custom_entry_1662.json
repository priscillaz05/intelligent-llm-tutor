You have to print the elements in sorted order which appears more than once. \\nInput Format:\\nThe first line of input contains T, denoting the number of testcases. T testcases follow. Each testcase contains two lines of input.  The first line of input contains size of array N.

Understand the input format with test cases and array size.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Consider the edge case where no duplicates exist, which requires printing -1. Need to handle duplicate entries of the same duplicate number.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: A counting approach can efficiently determine duplicate elements. A hash map (Counter) or dictionary can store element counts. Use a set to eliminate potential duplicates in our solution to ensure unique duplicate values. Sort the resulting list of duplicates before printing.\\n- Implementing Efficient Data Structures: Choose appropriate data structures to optimize performance, considering the frequency of lookups and insertions.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the primary objective of the problem, and what output is expected?\",\n    \"How would you handle the case where there are no duplicate elements in the array?\",\n    \"What data structure could you use to efficiently count the occurrences of each element in the array?\",\n    \"How can you ensure that only unique duplicate elements are printed and how do you get them in sorted order?\",\n    \"Given the constraint on array size, how would you decide on the memory and time complexity trade-offs?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The objective is to identify numbers that appear more than once in the array, sort them, and print them. If no duplicates are found, output -1.\",\n    \"I would check for the absence of duplicates after counting the element occurrences. If no element has a count greater than 1, I would print -1.\",\n    \"A hash map, such as a Python Counter, would be efficient for counting element occurrences because it offers constant-time lookups and insertions.\",\n    \"First store elements that occur more than once in a list. Then, convert this list to a set to ensure uniqueness. Convert it back to a list and sort it before printing.\",\n    \"Given the small array size (N <= 100), memory usage is not a critical concern, so a solution with a simple and clear implementation that offers reasonable time complexity (e.g., O(N log N) for sorting) would be suitable.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
