The task is to identify the coordinates of the single point that does not lie on the boundary of the square.\\n- Formulating a Strategy: The core idea is to iterate through each point and, for each point, consider it as the potentially \\\"outlier\\\" point.  For the remaining 4n points, determine the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates to define a potential square. Check if all the 4n points lie on the sides of this potential square.  If they do, then the initial point is the outlier. \\n- Handling Edge Cases: The constraints specify that 2 <= n <= 10 and 0 <= x_i, y_i <= 50.  We also know that all 4n+1 points are distinct, and each side of the square has at least n points. This ensures we can uniquely identify the square and the outlier.\\n- Algorithmic Details: The sides of the square must be parallel to the axes (axis-aligned). When determining the square's boundary, we can find the minimum and maximum x-coordinates and the minimum and maximum y-coordinates from the 4n points. A point lies on the square's boundary if its x-coordinate is either the minimum or maximum x or its y-coordinate is either the minimum or maximum y. Need to check that the sides are of equal length to form a square and the outlier is determined correctly.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you determine if a point lies on the boundary of an axis-aligned square given its corners?\",\n    \"Given a set of points, how can you find the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates efficiently?\",\n    \"How can you handle the iteration to consider each point as a possible outlier, and what operations should be performed for each point?\",\n    \"What conditions must be met to confirm that a point is the outlier?\",\n    \"What does it mean to be axis-aligned, and how does it simplify the solution strategy?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A point (x, y) lies on the boundary of a square defined by (min_x, min_y) and (max_x, max_y) if x == min_x or x == max_x or y == min_y or y == max_y.\",\n    \"Iterate through all points, maintaining running minimum and maximum values for both x and y.

This simplifies the solution because we only need to find the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates to define the square's boundaries.
