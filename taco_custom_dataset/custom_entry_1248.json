The goal is to determine if a given sequence of numbers 'a' appears as consecutive elements in any row of the table.\\n- Identifying Constraints and Edge Cases: The dimensions of the table can be very large (up to 10^12). The length of the sequence 'a' is limited (up to 10000). We need to handle cases where the least common multiple (LCM) of the sequence elements exceeds 'n', making it impossible for the sequence to occur in any row. The starting column index j+k-1 must be <= m to fit in the table.\\n- Choosing an Appropriate Algorithm: The solution needs to efficiently check if the sequence 'a' exists. It calculates the LCM of the sequence elements and determines if the LCM is a plausible row index. If it is, it attempts to find a column offset j such that the GCD(lcm, j + i) is equal to a[i] for all i in the range [0, k-1]. Extended Euclidean algorithm helps calculating j.\\n- Implementation Details: First calculate LCM. If LCM > n, return false. Calculate j using extended Euclidean algorithm and check if the calculated GCD values matches the input sequence. If all checks pass, return true.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for a sequence to occur in table G, and what condition must be satisfied for this to happen?\",\n    \"Given the large constraints on n and m, how can we efficiently determine if a sequence a is likely to be found in the table without generating the entire table?\",\n    \"How can we calculate a potential row number that could contain the sequence, and what properties must this row number have?\",\n    \"Once we have a candidate row, what algorithm can be used to find the starting column index 'j', if it exists?\",\n    \"After identifying a candidate 'j', what is the final verification step to ensure that the sequence at row 'lcm' starting at column 'j' matches the given sequence 'a'?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"For a sequence to occur in table G, there must exist a row 'i' and a starting column 'j' such that the GCD of 'i' and 'j + l - 1' equals the l-th element of the sequence 'a' for all elements within the sequence.

Instead, calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the sequence elements a_1 to a_k.
