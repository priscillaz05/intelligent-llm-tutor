A dictionary (rangeData) to store ranges and their filled values seems appropriate. Also, need to precompute prime factors of K.\\n- Query Processing: \\n  - For '! l r x' query: Iterate over existing ranges in rangeData. Split or ignore existing ranges based on overlap with the current query range. Store the new range [l, r] with value x in rangeData. Optimize to avoid overlapping ranges.\\n  - For '? l r' query: Iterate through the precomputed prime factors of K. Check if any of the numbers in the given range [l, r] have that prime factor.  A nested loop checks all numbers in the range for each prime factor. Optimize by checking only distinct numbers in the range.\\n- Prime Factorization: Implement a function to find the distinct prime factors of a number efficiently (distinctPrimeFactors).\\n- Optimization: Employ memoization to store prime factors of K. Store the filled ranges as key-value pairs in a dictionary.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can we efficiently represent the infinite array, given that only certain ranges are filled with values?\",\n    \"What data structures can be used to store and efficiently query the filled ranges?\",\n    \"How do we handle overlapping ranges when processing the '! l r x' query?\",\n    \"How do we optimize the '? l r' query to efficiently count prime factors without redundant checks?\",\n    \"What's an efficient algorithm to compute the prime factors of a number K?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"We can represent the infinite array using a dictionary or hashmap, where the keys are the start and end indices of filled ranges, and the values are the corresponding filled values. Empty parts of the array are implicitly represented by their absence in the dictionary.\",\n    \"A dictionary (rangeData) can be used to store filled ranges with their values. This allows quick lookups based on ranges. Also, a set of prime factors of K needs to be maintained. To optimize range searching, rangeData can be sorted by starting indices.\",\n    \"When a new '! l r x' query comes, iterate through the existing ranges. If there's an overlap, split the existing range if necessary, create new ranges, or simply update the values within the overlapping section. Ensure no overlapping ranges are present after the update.\",\n    \"Iterate through the prime factors of K, and then check each number within the range [l, r]. To optimize, only check distinct filled values within the range. Also, once a prime factor is found in the range, you don't need to check other numbers for that particular prime factor.\",\n    \"An efficient algorithm to compute prime factors of a number is to iterate from 2 up to the square root of the number. If a number 'i' divides K, add it to the set of prime factors and continue dividing K by 'i' until it's no longer divisible. After the loop, if K is greater than 2, add K to the set of prime factors because it must be prime.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
