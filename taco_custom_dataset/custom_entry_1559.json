Jumps can be either $+k$ or $-1$, where $k$ is the jump number. \\n- Identifying the Core Idea: The ideal strategy is to jump forward as much as possible, i.e. $1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n$. However, since a $-1$ jump is available, the total jump needs to be adjusted by utilizing $-1$ jump when $1+2+...+n > x$. Need to consider adding an additional +k jump and then use -1 to get to x.\\n- Devising the Algorithm: Calculate the sum of jumps $1 + 2 + ... + n$ until it's greater than or equal to $x$. If the sum is equal to $x$, the answer is $n$. If the sum is greater than $x$, then we need to consider using -1 jumps. Find appropriate conditions to apply the -1 jumps to reach x.\\n- Optimization and Edge Cases: Optimize by starting with the nearest n. Also, check the condition where we need one additional forward jump.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean to jump to the point y + k or y - 1, and how does k relate to the jump number?\",\n    \"How can you determine the minimum number of jumps required to reach x?\",\n    \"If the sum of jumps 1 + 2 + ... + n is greater than x, what adjustment strategies are possible?\",\n    \"Are there any edge cases or scenarios that require special handling, such as when x is a small number?\",\n    \"If the ideal sum is close to x but not exactly x, how can you leverage the '-1' jumps efficiently?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"It means that during the k-th jump, you either move k units forward (add k to the current position) or move 1 unit backward (subtract 1 from the current position). k represents the sequence number of the jump.\",\n    \"Try to reach x primarily with positive jumps (+k) and then adjust using -1 jumps when exceeding x. The minimal number of jumps is required, so the jumps must be as efficient as possible.\",\n    \"One possible adjustment strategy is to include '-1' jumps to reduce the total distance. Another strategy is to add an additional +k jump and compensate for the added distance using the '-1' jump to ensure the result is exactly x.\",\n    \"Yes, if x is a small number, such as 1 or 2, the optimal strategy may involve using fewer jumps or a different sequence of jumps.\",\n    \"Use the -1 jump effectively. Calculate by how much the sum of jumps exceeds x and see if you can get to x using the number of -1 jumps required or by adding another forward jump +k and using a -1 jump. In particular, consider cases where we only need to adjust by 1 or 2.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
