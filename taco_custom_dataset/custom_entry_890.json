His character has the following ability: given an enemy hero, deal $a$ instant damage to him, and then heal that enemy $b$ health points at the end of every second, for exactly $c$ seconds, starting one second after the ability is used. That means that if the ability is used at time $t$, the enemy's health decreases by $a$ at time $t$, and then increases by $b$ at time points $t + 1$, $t + 2$, ..., $t + c$ due to this ability.\\n\\nThe ability has a cooldown of $d$ seconds, i.\u00a0e. if Meka-Naruto uses it at time moment $t$, next time he can use it is the time $t + d$. Please note that he can only use the ability at integer points in time, so all changes to the enemy's health also occur at integer times only.\\n\\nThe effects from different uses of the ability may stack with each other; that is, the enemy which is currently under $k$ spells gets $k\\\\cdot b$ amount of heal this time. Also, if several health changes occur at the same moment, they are all counted at once.\\n\\nNow Meka-Naruto wonders if he can kill the enemy by just using the ability each time he can (that is, every $d$ seconds). The enemy is killed if their health points become $0$ or less. Assume that the enemy's health is not affected in any way other than by Meka-Naruto's character ability. What is the maximal number of health points the enemy can have so that Meka-Naruto is able to kill them?\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1\\\\leq t\\\\leq 10^5$) standing for the number of testcases.\\n\\nEach test case is described with one line containing four numbers $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ ($1\\\\leq a, b, c, d\\\\leq 10^6$) denoting the amount of instant damage, the amount of heal per second, the number of heals and the ability cooldown, respectively.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nFor each testcase in a separate line print $-1$ if the skill can kill an enemy hero with an arbitrary number of health points, otherwise print the maximal number of health points of the enemy that can be killed.\\n\\n\\n-----Example-----\\nInput\\n7\\n1 1 1 1\\n2 2 2 2\\n1 2 3 4\\n4 3 2 1\\n228 21 11 3\\n239 21 11 3\\n1000000 1 1000000 1\\n\\nOutput\\n1\\n2\\n1\\n5\\n534\\n-1\\n500000500000\\n\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first test case of the example each unit of damage is cancelled in a second, so Meka-Naruto cannot deal more than 1 damage.\\n\\nIn the fourth test case of the example the enemy gets:  $4$ damage ($1$-st spell cast) at time $0$;  $4$ damage ($2$-nd spell cast) and $3$ heal ($1$-st spell cast) at time $1$ (the total of $5$ damage to the initial health);  $4$ damage ($3$-nd spell cast) and $6$ heal ($1$-st and $2$-nd spell casts) at time $2$ (the total of $3$ damage to the initial health);  and so on. \\n\\nOne can prove that there is no time where the enemy gets the total of $6$ damage or more, so the answer is $5$. Please note how the health is recalculated: for example, $8$-health enemy would not die at time $1$, as if we first subtracted $4$ damage from his health and then considered him dead, before adding $3$ heal.\\n\\nIn the sixth test case an arbitrarily healthy enemy can be killed in a sufficient amount of time.\\n\\nIn the seventh test case the answer does not fit into a 32-bit integer type.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import sys\\ns = sys.stdin.read().split()\\np = 0\\n\\ndef getSm(k, a, b, c, d):\\n\\treturn (k + 1) * a - (k * (k + 1) >> 1) * b * d\\nt = int(s[p])\\np += 1\\nres = []\\nfor _ in range(t):\\n\\ta = int(s[p])\\n\\tp += 1\\n\\tb = int(s[p])\\n\\tp += 1\\n\\tc = int(s[p])\\n\\tp += 1\\n\\td = int(s[p])\\n\\tp += 1\\n\\tif a - b * c > 0:\\n\\t\\tres.append(-1)\\n\\telif d >= c:\\n\\t\\tres.append(a)\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tdn = 0\\n\\t\\tup = int(1000000.0) + 1\\n\\t\\twhile up - dn > 1:\\n\\t\\t\\tmd = up + dn >> 1\\n\\t\\t\\tif getSm(md, a, b, c, d) < getSm(md + 1, a, b, c, d):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdn = md\\n\\t\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tup = md\\n\\t\\tans = max(a, getSm(dn, a, b, c, d), getSm(up, a, b, c, d))\\n\\t\\tres.append(ans)\\nprint('\\\\n'.join(map(str, res)))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem describes a scenario where an enemy hero's health is affected by a character's ability that causes initial damage and subsequent healing over a period. The task is to determine the maximum initial health the enemy can have such that the character can eventually kill it.\\n- Identifying Key Factors: The key factors include the initial damage 'a', the healing rate 'b', the healing duration 'c', and the ability cooldown 'd'. The interaction between these factors determines whether the enemy can be killed or not.\\n- Analyzing the Condition for Infinite Health: If the damage from a single ability is always offset by the total healing it provides during its healing duration, the enemy cannot be killed regardless of initial health. This condition can be expressed as a - b * c > 0.\\n- Considering the Case Where Cooldown Exceeds Healing Duration: If the cooldown 'd' is greater than or equal to the healing duration 'c', no healing from previous abilities occurs when a new ability is cast. In this scenario, the maximum health that can be killed is simply the initial damage 'a'.\\n- Devising a Strategy for Calculating Maximal Killable Health: When d < c, the healing effects from different uses of the ability stack. We need to find the optimal number of ability uses that maximizes the damage done to the enemy. This involves calculating the cumulative damage and healing over time, considering the stacking heals. The maximal killable health can be found by finding the maximum damage at any time.\\n- Optimizing the Solution: The optimal solution should handle large inputs and avoid inefficient computations. Binary search can be used to determine the number of ability uses 'k' which results in the maximum damage. The problem requires the use of 64-bit integers to handle larger values.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the conditions under which the enemy hero cannot be killed regardless of their initial health?\",\n    \"When the ability's cooldown is longer than or equal to its healing duration, how does it simplify the calculation of the maximum health that can be killed?\",\n    \"If the ability's cooldown is shorter than its healing duration, how do the healing effects stack, and how does this affect the approach to calculating the maximal killable health?\",\n    \"How would you optimize the calculation to handle large input values efficiently and ensure accuracy?\",\n    \"What edge cases need to be considered, and how will they affect the result?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The enemy hero cannot be killed if the initial damage 'a' is less than or equal to the total healing 'b * c'. In other words, if a - b * c > 0, the enemy's health will always increase or stay the same, and they cannot be killed.\",\n    \"When the ability's cooldown 'd' is greater than or equal to the healing duration 'c', the healing effects do not stack. The maximum health that can be killed is simply the initial damage 'a', as this is the only damage the enemy will ever take.\",\n    \"If the ability's cooldown 'd' is shorter than the healing duration 'c', the healing effects from different ability uses stack. We must calculate the cumulative damage and healing at various time points, considering how many abilities are active. The maximal killable health will be the maximum net damage inflicted at any point in time.\",\n    \"To optimize the calculation for large input values, avoid iterating through every possible time step. Instead, use mathematical formulas to calculate the cumulative damage and healing. A binary search can be used to determine the number of ability uses 'k' that yields the maximum damage, thus avoiding brute-force iteration. Ensure that 64-bit integers are used to prevent overflow.\",\n    \"Edge cases to consider include when 'a', 'b', 'c', or 'd' are zero. Also, consider the condition when a - b * c >= 0, in which case the answer is -1. If d >= c, the answer is simply 'a'. The values can be large, so integer overflows must be prevented by using 64-bit integers and by carefully designing the computations.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
