"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"In elementary arithmetic a \\\"carry\\\" is a digit that is transferred from one column of digits to another column of more significant digits during a calculation algorithm.\\n\\nThis Kata is about determining the number of carries performed during the addition of multi-digit numbers.\\n\\nYou will receive an input string containing a set of pairs of numbers formatted as follows:\\n\\n```\\n123 456\\n555 555\\n123 594\\n```\\n\\nAnd your output should be a string formatted as follows:\\n\\n```\\nNo carry operation\\n1 carry operations\\n3 carry operations\\n```\\n\\n###Some Assumptions\\n\\n- Assume that numbers can be of any length.\\n- But both numbers in the pair will be of the same length.\\n- Although not all the numbers in the set need to be of the same length.\\n- If a number is shorter, it will be zero-padded.\\n- The input may contain any arbitrary number of pairs.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def solve(s):\\n\\tans = []\\n\\tfor ab in s.split('\\\\n'):\\n\\t\\t(carry, carried) = (0, 0)\\n\\t\\tfor (a, b) in zip(*map(lambda ss: map(int, ss[::-1]), ab.split())):\\n\\t\\t\\tcarried += a + b\\n\\t\\t\\tcarry += carried > 9\\n\\t\\t\\tcarried //= 10\\n\\t\\tans.append(carry)\\n\\treturn '\\\\n'.join(('No carry operation' if not c else '%d carry operations' % c for c in ans))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Problem Understanding: The core task is to count the number of carry operations when adding pairs of numbers, provided as strings. Each pair of numbers is on a new line, and numbers within a pair are space-separated.\\n- Data Processing: The input string needs to be split into individual pairs. Each number within the pair must then be converted to integers for addition. Because the numbers are of the same length and added from right to left (least significant digit first), they can be reversed to simplify the addition process.\\n- Carry Calculation: Simulate the addition process column by column. If the sum of the digits in a column exceeds 9, a carry operation occurs. Keep track of the number of carry operations for each pair.\\n- Output Formatting: The number of carry operations for each pair needs to be converted to the desired string format (e.g., \\\"No carry operation\\\", \\\"1 carry operations\\\", \\\"3 carry operations\\\"). The results for all pairs should be joined together with newline characters.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you handle multiple pairs of numbers in the input string?\",\n    \"What steps are involved in preparing each pair of numbers for addition?\",\n    \"How would you simulate the carry operation, and how does this affect the next column's addition?\",\n    \"What edge cases should be considered, and how will the solution deal with them?\",\n    \"After computing the carry operation count, how is the output formatted to match the problem's specification?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The input string is split by newline characters to separate each pair of numbers.\",\n    \"Each pair of numbers is split by spaces, converted to integer lists, and reversed to facilitate addition from the least significant digit.\",\n    \"If the sum of two digits in a column, plus any carry from the previous column, exceeds 9, a carry occurs. Update the carry count, and carry-over 1 to the next column.\",\n    \"The primary edge case to consider is when either number in the pair is 0, where no carry operations can happen or cases where the sum of two digits results in a two-digit number.\",\n    \"The carry operation count is formatted into a string, which states \\\"No carry operation\\\" if the count is 0, or \\\"{count} carry operations\\\" otherwise. These are then joined with newline characters.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
