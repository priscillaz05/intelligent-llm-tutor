To ensure a better life for the Mars citizens, their emperor decided to take tax from every tourist who visited the planet.\\n\\nNatasha is the inhabitant of Earth, therefore she had to pay the tax to enter the territory of Mars.\\n\\nThere are n banknote denominations on Mars: the value of i-th banknote is a_i. Natasha has an infinite number of banknotes of each denomination.\\n\\nMartians have k fingers on their hands, so they use a number system with base k. In addition, the Martians consider the digit d (in the number system with base k) divine. Thus, if the last digit in Natasha's tax amount written in the number system with the base k is d, the Martians will be happy. Unfortunately, Natasha does not know the Martians' divine digit yet.\\n\\nDetermine for which values d Natasha can make the Martians happy.\\n\\nNatasha can use only her banknotes. Martians don't give her change.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000, 2 \u2264 k \u2264 100 000) \u2014 the number of denominations of banknotes and the base of the number system on Mars.\\n\\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9) \u2014 denominations of banknotes on Mars.\\n\\nAll numbers are given in decimal notation.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nOn the first line output the number of values d for which Natasha can make the Martians happy.\\n\\nIn the second line, output all these values in increasing order.\\n\\nPrint all numbers in decimal notation.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nInput\\n\\n2 8\\n12 20\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n2\\n0 4 \\n\\nInput\\n\\n3 10\\n10 20 30\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n1\\n0 \\n\\nNote\\n\\nConsider the first test case. It uses the octal number system.\\n\\nIf you take one banknote with the value of 12, you will get 14_8 in octal system. The last digit is 4_8.\\n\\nIf you take one banknote with the value of 12 and one banknote with the value of 20, the total value will be 32. In the octal system, it is 40_8. The last digit is 0_8.\\n\\nIf you take two banknotes with the value of 20, the total value will be 40, this is 50_8 in the octal system. The last digit is 0_8.\\n\\nNo other digits other than 0_8 and 4_8 can be obtained. Digits 0_8 and 4_8 could also be obtained in other ways.\\n\\nThe second test case uses the decimal number system. The nominals of all banknotes end with zero, so Natasha can give the Martians only the amount whose decimal notation also ends with zero.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"from functools import reduce\\nfrom math import gcd\\n(n, k) = map(int, input().split())\\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\\nG = gcd(k, reduce(lambda x, y: gcd(x, y), A))\\nprint(k // G)\\nprint(*list(range(0, k, G)))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The goal is to find which digits in base `k` can be the last digit of a sum formed by any combination of the given denominations.\\n- Identifying the Key Insight: The crucial insight is recognizing that the possible last digits are determined by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `k` and all the denominations `a_i`. Let `g = gcd(k, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)`. Then any multiple of `g` will result in a valid tax. The possible last digits are multiples of `g` less than `k`.\\n- Deriving the Solution: The possible last digits are 0, `g`, `2g`, `3g`, ..., `(k/g - 1) * g`.  The number of such digits is `k/g`.\\n- Implementation details: Use functools.reduce and math.gcd to find the GCD of the numbers. Print the number of possible digits, followed by the list of these digits generated by range(0, k, G).\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the problem asking, in simpler terms?\",\n    \"How can we determine if a specific digit d can be the last digit of a sum formed by the banknotes?\",\n    \"How does the greatest common divisor (GCD) relate to the possible last digits?\",\n    \"How can we find all possible values of the last digit 'd'?\",\n    \"Given the value of GCD, can you derive a formula for the number of values 'd' can take?\",\n    \"If we find the GCD, how can we effectively print all the possible values of d in the required format (increasing order)?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The problem asks to find all possible last digits when the sum of some banknotes are expressed in base `k`.\",\n    \"We need to check if we can create a sum of banknotes such that when expressed in base `k`, it leaves a remainder equal to `d`.\",\n    \"The GCD of `k` and all denominations `a_i` (g) determines the smallest possible last digit other than 0.

Then, all multiples of `g` which are less than `k` are possible values of `d`.\",\n    \"The number of such possible values `d` can take will be equal to k/GCD.\",\n    \"Use range(0, k, GCD) to generate all possible d and print them.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
