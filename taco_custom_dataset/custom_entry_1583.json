Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).\\nThe difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:\\n- Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.\\n- Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.\\n- Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.\\n- For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.\\nYou should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $P$ and $S$ denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.\\n- $2P$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $2i-1$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $SC_1, SC_2, \\\\dots, SC_S$ denoting the scores of the $i$-th problem's subtasks, and the $2i$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $NS_1, NS_2, \\\\dots, NS_S$ denoting the number of contestants who solved the $i$-th problem's subtasks.\\n\\n-----Output-----\\nPrint $P$ lines containing one integer each \u2014 the indices of the problems in the increasing order of difficulty.\\n\\n-----Constraints-----\\n- $1 \\\\le P \\\\le 100,000$\\n- $2 \\\\le S \\\\le 30$\\n- $1 \\\\le SC_i \\\\le 100$ for each valid $i$\\n- $1 \\\\le NS_i \\\\le 1,000$ for each valid $i$\\n- in each problem, the scores of all subtasks are unique\\n\\n-----Subtasks-----\\nSubtask #1 (25 points): $S = 2$\\nSubtask #2 (75 points): original constraints\\n\\n-----Example Input-----\\n3 3\\n16 24 60\\n498 861 589\\n14 24 62\\n72 557 819\\n16 15 69\\n435 779 232\\n\\n-----Example Output-----\\n2\\n1\\n3\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"(p, sb) = map(int, input().split())\\nans = list()\\nfor i in range(p):\\n\\t(s, n) = (list(map(int, input().split())), list(map(int, input().split())))\\n\\tlis = list()\\n\\tcnt = 0\\n\\tfor j in range(sb):\\n\\t\\tlis.append([s[j], n[j]])\\n\\tlis.sort()\\n\\tfor j in range(sb - 1):\\n\\t\\tif lis[j][1] > lis[j + 1][1]:\\n\\t\\t\\tcnt += 1\\n\\tans.append([cnt, i])\\nans.sort()\\nfor i in ans:\\n\\tprint(i[1] + 1)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the problem: The problem asks us to calculate the difficulty of each problem in a contest and then sort the problems by their difficulty.\\n- Difficulty Calculation: The difficulty of a problem is defined as a pair (n, i), where n is the number of adjacent subtasks where the number of solvers decreases as the subtask score increases, and i is the problem index.\\n- Sorting Criteria: Problems should be sorted in ascending order of difficulty. This means comparing 'n' first. If 'n' is the same for two problems, we compare the problem index 'i'.\\n- Input Processing: The input consists of the number of problems 'P' and the number of subtasks 'S'. Then for each problem, there are two lines: the scores of the subtasks and the number of contestants who solved them.\\n- Algorithm: For each problem, create a list of pairs (score, solvers). Sort this list by score. Iterate through the sorted list and count the number of times the number of solvers decreases as score increases. Store this count and the problem index as the difficulty. After processing all problems, sort them based on the difficulty (n, i). Finally, print the problem indices in the sorted order.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you calculate the difficulty metric 'n' for each problem?\",\n    \"What data structure would you use to store the subtask scores and number of solvers for each problem?\",\n    \"How does the sorting of problems work, especially considering the difficulty is a pair of integers?\",\n    \"What are the constraints on the input, and how might they influence the choice of algorithms or data structures?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The difficulty metric 'n' is calculated by sorting the subtasks by score and then counting the number of adjacent subtasks where the number of solvers for the higher-score subtask is less than the number of solvers for the lower-score subtask.\",\n    \"A list of pairs (score, solvers) is an efficient way to store the subtask data for each problem. We can then sort this list based on the score.\",\n    \"The problems are sorted based on the difficulty pair (n, i). First, compare the 'n' values. If they are different, the problem with the smaller 'n' is considered easier. If the 'n' values are the same, the problem with the smaller index 'i' is considered easier.\",\n    \"The constraints specify the range of values for P, S, SC_i and NS_i. Also, it's said that in each problem, scores of all subtasks are unique. These constraints influence the efficiency requirements for the algorithm and data structure. Given P can be up to 100,000, an efficient sorting algorithm is necessary.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
