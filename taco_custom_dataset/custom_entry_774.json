He uses Switch/Cases to evaluate the given properties of an object, can you fix timmy's function?\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def eval_object(v):\\n\\treturn {'+': v['a'] + v['b'], '-': v['a'] - v['b'], '/': v['a'] / v['b'], '*': v['a'] * v['b'], '%': v['a'] % v['b'], '**': v['a'] ** v['b']}.get(v['operation'])\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem states that the evalObject function using Switch/Cases is not working correctly. The goal is to fix the function so that it correctly evaluates the given properties of an object.\\n- Analyzing the Incorrect Approach: Switch/Case is not natively supported in Python. We need to use a more appropriate approach to map operations to their corresponding calculations.\\n- Choosing an Appropriate Data Structure: A dictionary can be used to map each operation symbol to the corresponding lambda expression that performs the required calculation.\\n- Implementing the Solution: The dictionary would store operation symbols ('+', '-', '*', '/', '%', '**') as keys and the corresponding calculations as values. Use the .get() method to handle cases where the operation is not found in the dictionary.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the inputs to the `eval_object` function?\",\n    \"What types of operations need to be supported in the function?\",\n    \"How can you effectively implement a switch/case style logic in Python without directly using switch/case statements?\",\n    \"How do you handle the case where the 'operation' key does not match any of the valid operations?\",\n    \"What data structure in Python can be used to map operations to their corresponding calculations?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The input is a dictionary `v` that contains keys 'a', 'b', and 'operation'.\",\n    \"The function needs to support addition ('+'), subtraction ('-'), multiplication ('*'), division ('/'), modulo ('%'), and exponentiation ('**').\",\n    \"You can use a dictionary to map operations to their corresponding lambda functions or functions.\",\n    \"The .get() method of a dictionary can be used with a default return value to handle cases where the operation is not found, though not necessary here as the problem assumes that the input will always be valid.\",\n    \"A dictionary where keys are operation strings and values are the computed result.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
