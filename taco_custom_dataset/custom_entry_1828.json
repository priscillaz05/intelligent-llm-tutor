This means that one person requires $2\\\\cdot 6 = 12$ litres of water to take a bath. Since this is less than the total water present in geyser, $0$ people can take bath.\\n\\nTest Case $2$: One bucket has a capacity of $1$ litre. This means that one person requires $2\\\\cdot 1 = 2$ litres of water to take a bath. The total amount of water present in geyser is $25$ litres. Thus, $12$ people can take bath. Note that $1$ litre water would remain unused in the geyser.\\n\\nTest Case $3$: One bucket has a capacity of $10$ litres. This means that one person requires $2\\\\cdot 10 = 20$ litres of water to take a bath. The total amount of water present in geyser is $100$ litres. Thus, $5$ people can take bath. Note that $0$ litres of water would remain unused in the geyser after this.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"n = int(input())\\nfor i in range(n):\\n\\t(a, b) = map(int, input().split())\\n\\tp = b * 2\\n\\tprint(a // p)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem provides the capacity of a geyser (X) and a bucket (Y). Each person needs 2 buckets of water to take a bath.  We need to determine how many people can take a bath given the geyser's capacity.\\n- Calculation of water per person:  Calculate the amount of water each person needs by multiplying the bucket capacity (Y) by 2.\\n- Determine number of people: Integer divide the geyser's capacity (X) by the amount of water required by each person, because we want the maximum number of *whole* people who can take a bath. Discard any remainder.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the formula to determine the amount of water one person requires for a bath, given the bucket's capacity?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the maximum number of people who can take a bath, considering the geyser's total capacity and the water needed per person?\",\n    \"What data types are appropriate for the input values and why?\",\n    \"What operations are required to fulfill the requirements of the problem?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The amount of water one person requires is 2 * Y, where Y is the bucket's capacity.\",\n    \"The maximum number of people is calculated by X // (2 * Y), where X is the geyser's capacity and // represents integer division.\",\n    \"Integers are appropriate for the input values, as the number of litres and people must be whole numbers. Floating point would not make sense in this context.\",\n    \"The problem requires input reading, basic arithmetic operations (multiplication and integer division), and output printing.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
