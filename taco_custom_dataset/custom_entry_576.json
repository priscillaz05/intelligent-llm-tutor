"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"Chef is a private detective. He was asked to investigate a case of murder in the city of Frangton.\\nChef arrived in Frangton to find out that the mafia was involved in the case. Chef spent some time watching for people that belong to the clan and was able to build a map of relationships between them. He knows that a mafia's organizational structure consists of a single Don, heading a hierarchical criminal organization. Each member reports exactly to one other member of the clan. It's obvious that there are no cycles in the reporting system of the mafia.\\nThere are N people in the clan, for simplicity indexed from 1 to N, and Chef knows who each of them report to. Member i reports to member Ri.\\nNow, Chef needs to identfy all potential killers to continue his investigation. Having considerable knowledge about the mafia's activities, Chef knows that the killer must be a minor criminal, that is, one of the members who nobody reports to. Please find the list of potential killers for Chef. Since Don reports to nobody, his Ri will be equal to 0.\\n\\n-----Input-----\\nThe first line of input contains one integer N.\\nNext line has N space-separated integers, the ith integer denotes Ri \u2014 the person whom the ith member reports to.\\n\\n-----Output-----\\nOutput a list of space-separated integers in ascending order \u2014 the indices of potential killers.\\n\\n-----Constraints-----\\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 105\\n- 1 \u2264 Ri \u2264 N except for Don, whose Ri equals to 0.\\n- It is guaranteed that there are no cycles in the reporting structure.\\n\\n-----Subtasks-----\\n- Subtask #1 [50 points]: N \u2264 10000\\n- Subtask #2 [50 points]: No additional constraints\\n\\n-----Example-----\\nInput:\\n6\\n0 1 1 2 2 3\\n\\nOutput:\\n4 5 6\\n\\n-----Explanation-----\\nThe reporting structure:\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"n = eval(input())\\nr = list(map(int, input().split()))\\ntree = dict()\\ni = 1\\nfor j in r:\\n\\tc = tree.get(j)\\n\\tif c:\\n\\t\\ttree[j].append(i)\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\ttree[j] = [i]\\n\\tif not tree.get(i):\\n\\t\\ttree[i] = []\\n\\ti += 1\\ns = []\\nfor elem in tree:\\n\\tif not tree[elem]:\\n\\t\\ts.append(str(elem))\\nprint(' '.join(s))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understand the problem: The task is to find members of a mafia clan who are not reported to by anyone else (minor criminals). The input provides who each member reports to. The Don reports to no one (R[i] = 0).\\n- Identify potential edge cases:  Empty clan (N=0), only a Don (N=1, R[0] = 0), everyone reports to the Don, multiple individuals are not reported to.\\n- Select an appropriate data structure: Use a dictionary (or hash map) to store the reporting structure. The keys will be the members who are being reported to, and the values will be a list of members who report to them. A set can also be used to keep track of who reports to whom.\\n- Develop an algorithm: First, read the input and build the reporting structure. Then, iterate through all members and check if anyone reports to them. If a member is not reported to by anyone, add them to the list of potential killers. Finally, sort the list of potential killers in ascending order and print them.\\n- Optimize for the given constraints: The number of members is up to 10^5, so the algorithm should be efficient enough to avoid timeouts. The dictionary operations have O(1) average time complexity, which should be sufficient.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you represent the reporting relationships between members of the mafia clan in a suitable data structure?\",\n    \"How do you identify members who are not reported to by anyone?\",\n    \"What happens if the input is an empty clan or consists only of a Don?\",\n    \"What is the role of the Don in the reporting structure, and how is it represented in the input?\",\n    \"How do you ensure the list of potential killers is printed in ascending order, as required by the output format?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A dictionary (or hash map) can efficiently represent the reporting relationships, where the key is the member being reported to, and the value is a list of members who report to them.\",\n    \"Iterate through all members (1 to N) and check if they appear in the list of members being reported to. If a member does not appear, they are not reported to by anyone and are a potential killer.\",\n    \"If the clan is empty (N=0), there are no killers. If it only contains a Don (N=1, R[0]=0), then the Don is the only member, and since nobody reports to him, he should be printed.\",\n    \"The Don reports to no one, which is indicated by R[i] = 0 for the Don's index i. He is the head of the organization, so no one reports to 0.\",\n    \"Sort the list of potential killers after identifying them and before printing them to ensure the output is in ascending order.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
