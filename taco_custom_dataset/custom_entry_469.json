Moreover, he invented a new problem and Iahubina has to solve it, otherwise Iahub won't give her the food. \\n\\nIahub asks Iahubina: can you build a rooted tree, such that\\n\\n  each internal node (a node with at least one son) has at least two sons;  node i has c_{i} nodes in its subtree? \\n\\nIahubina has to guess the tree. Being a smart girl, she realized that it's possible no tree can follow Iahub's restrictions. In this way, Iahub will eat all the food. You need to help Iahubina: determine if there's at least one tree following Iahub's restrictions. The required tree must contain n nodes.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line of the input contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 24).

The subtree size constraint (c_i for each node 'i') must be satisfied. The tree must contain 'n' nodes in total.\\n- Formulating a Strategy: The largest subtree size must be 'n'. If it isn't, the tree cannot be constructed. Further, a subtree of size '2' will render the problem impossible as each internal node need to have at least two children and a subtree size of 2 means that is a parent and a single child only which contradicts the condition that internal nodes need to have at least two nodes. Sort the subtree sizes in descending order. The first element should be equal to n and there shouldn't be any element equal to 2. The children of the root must have subtree sizes that add up to n-1. Each subsequent node must find a suitable parent. We can test each parent from 0 to i-1 to determine if there is enough remaining \\\"space\\\" for node i. Perform a Depth First Search (DFS) to try and build the tree. Store the remaining size after assigning nodes. Use dynamic programming to store which nodes were visited to avoid cycles.\\n- Identifying Edge Cases: The case when n = 1. The case where C[0] != n. Check if all the sizes add up to n. Consider the case when there are subtrees of size 2 as the code will print \\\"NO\\\".\\n- Implementation Details: Use an adjacency list to store parent-child relationships. Utilize a boolean matrix for keeping track of the visited nodes to avoid cycles. Maintain a 'Rem' array to store the remaining size for each subtree. Sort C in decreasing order to simplify finding the solution.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for each internal node to have at least two sons, and how does this constraint impact the possible tree structures?\",\n    \"How does the subtree size constraint (c_i) affect the placement of each node in the tree?\",\n    \"Given that the subtree sizes are provided, how can you determine if a valid tree structure can even be constructed?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases for which no tree can be constructed and will lead to a \\\"NO\\\" output?\",\n    \"What data structures would be useful to maintain parent-child relationships and remaining subtree sizes during construction, and how would you utilize these data structures in the solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"It means every non-leaf node must have at least two children. This limits the branching factor of the tree and restricts the relationships among the nodes. Internal nodes will require at least two subtrees.\",\n    \"The subtree size determines how many nodes must be descendants (including the node itself) of that node. Each node can only be placed as a child of a node whose remaining subtree size is large enough to accommodate the new subtree.\",\n    \"Sort the subtree sizes. The largest subtree size should be 'n'. The children's subtree sizes should add up to n-1. An exhaustive approach is to attempt to build the tree using the c_i values for each node i.\",\n    \"One edge case is when the maximum subtree size is not equal to n which suggests that a tree cannot be made from the input. Another edge case is when c_i = 2, it cannot be constructed as that will violate the constraint that the internal nodes should have at least two nodes.\",\n    \"An adjacency list to store parent-child relationships is useful. You can also use arrays to track remaining subtree sizes and a boolean matrix for visited nodes during DFS. Adjacency lists would store which node is a child node and other arrays will store how much available nodes each node has. Boolean matrixes avoid cycles during DFS.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
