Alex is confused about div and span tags, so Maya decides to reduce the concept to a simpler visual by representing div tags as square brackets and span tags as parentheses. In other words, she represents <div> as [, </div> as ], <span> as (, and </span> as ).\\n\\nWe use the following rules to determine the validity of a configuration:\\n\\nThe empty string (\\\"\\\"), a single pair of square brackets [], and single pair of parentheses () are all considered to be valid configurations. We can express each of these as ${V}$.\\nA valid configuration, ${V}$, which does not contain square brackets is called a normal configuration, which we can express as $N$. For example, () is normal.\\nTwo or more consecutive valid configurations (e.g., ${VV}$) also constitute a valid configuration. For example, [][], ()(), and []()[] are all valid.\\nThe following configurations are also valid: [V], (N). \\n\\nFor example, [[(())]()], ((())), and [(())[]] are all valid; however, ([]) is not valid (you cannot nest a div tag inside a span tag).\\n\\nGiven some number of distinguishable square brackets, ${X}$, and some number of distinguishable parentheses, ${Y}$, how many valid configurations can we build using the above rules?

For this reason, we have $18}$ possible configurations and print the result of $18\\\\%(10^9+7)$ on a new line.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"m = 10 ** 9 + 7\\np_lim = 201\\nfact = [1]\\nfor i in range(1, 250000):\\n\\tfact.append(fact[-1] * i % m)\\n\\ndef egcd(a, b):\\n\\tif a == 0:\\n\\t\\treturn (b, 0, 1)\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\t(g, y, x) = egcd(b % a, a)\\n\\t\\treturn (g, x - b // a * y, y)\\n\\ndef modinv(a, m):\\n\\twhile a < 0:\\n\\t\\ta += m\\n\\t(g, x, y) = egcd(a, m)\\n\\tif g != 1:\\n\\t\\traise Exception('Modular inverse does not exist')\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\treturn x % m\\n\\ndef choose(n, k):\\n\\tr = fact[n] * modinv(fact[k], m) % m\\n\\treturn r * modinv(fact[n - k], m) % m\\n\\ndef C(n):\\n\\treturn fact[2 * n] * modinv(fact[n + 1], m) % m\\ndpp = [[0 for _ in range(p_lim)] for _ in range(p_lim)]\\ndpp[0][0] = 1\\ncumsum = [0 for _ in range(p_lim)]\\ncumsum[0] = 1\\nfor i in range(1, p_lim):\\n\\tdpp[i][1] = cumsum[i - 1] % m\\n\\tcumsum[i] = (cumsum[i] + dpp[i][1]) % m\\n\\tfor j in range(2, p_lim):\\n\\t\\tfor k in range(1, i - j + 2):\\n\\t\\t\\tdpp[i][j] = (dpp[i][j] + dpp[k][1] * dpp[i - k][j - 1]) % m\\n\\t\\tcumsum[i] = (cumsum[i] + dpp[i][j]) % m\\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\\n\\t(x, y) = map(int, input().split())\\n\\tr = 0\\n\\tfor i in range(y + 1):\\n\\t\\tr += dpp[y][i] * choose(2 * x + i, i)\\n\\t\\tr %= m\\n\\tr = r * fact[y] % m\\n\\tr = r * C(x) % m\\n\\tprint(r)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem asks us to find the number of valid configurations of square brackets and parentheses based on specific rules, similar to HTML div and span tags. The count must be calculated modulo $10^9 + 7$.\\n- Breaking Down the Rules: The rules define valid configurations recursively. An empty string, a single pair of square brackets [], and a single pair of parentheses () are valid. Concatenation of valid configurations is valid. Also, a valid configuration can be enclosed in square brackets [V] or a normal configuration can be enclosed in parentheses (N), where a normal configuration does not contain square brackets.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints: The number of square brackets, X, can be up to $10^5$, while the number of parentheses, Y, can be up to 200. This difference suggests that a dynamic programming approach might be effective, especially concerning the number of parentheses.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: A combination of dynamic programming and combinatorics seems appropriate.  We can use dynamic programming to count the number of valid parenthesis configurations and then use combinatorics (specifically Catalan numbers and binomial coefficients) to account for the square brackets and the combinations of both.\\n- Defining the DP State: Define `dpp[i][j]` as the number of valid parenthesis configurations with `i` pairs of parentheses and `j` number of non-empty sequences. The transitions will likely involve considering how configurations can be built recursively. Catalan number calculation for square brackets.\\n- Accounting for Distinguishability: We also need to consider that the parentheses are distinguishable. This means after determining number of arrangements for given number of parenthesis, we need to multiply by fact(number of parenthesis pairs).\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can we formally define a valid configuration in terms of recursive sub-configurations, and how do the rules constrain the nesting of brackets and parentheses?\",\n    \"Given the large constraints on the number of brackets and the relatively smaller constraints on the number of parentheses, how can we decompose the problem to use an efficient dynamic programming approach? How will we choose DP state.\",\n    \"How can we deal with the modulo constraint efficiently, ensuring that intermediate calculations do not exceed the maximum integer size and that the final result is accurate?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases or base cases we need to consider when initializing our dynamic programming table or calculating the number of valid configurations?\",\n    \"How does the fact that brackets and parentheses are distinguishable influence the final count, and how do we incorporate this into the combinatorial calculations?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A valid configuration can be defined recursively as either an empty string, [], (), VV (concatenation of two valid configurations), [V], or (N), where V is any valid configuration and N is a valid configuration that doesn't contain square brackets. The rule (N) prohibits nesting div tags (square brackets) inside span tags (parentheses).\",\n    \"We can focus on using DP based on number of parenthesis pairs since the limit for number of parenthesis pairs is only 200. The DP can calculate the number of valid combinations of parenthesis pairs and then we use catalan number to calculate valid combination for square brackets and then use binomial coefficients to combine the valid combinations of both.\",\n    \"We must apply the modulo operator % after every arithmetic operation (addition, multiplication) to ensure that the values stay within the integer range and to obtain the correct modulo result.\",\n    \"For the DP table, `dpp[0][0]` = 1 as an empty string is a valid configuration. For the Catalan number, C(0) = 1 (one valid arrangement for zero pairs). Also need to consider base cases when calculating binomial coefficients (n choose 0 = 1).\",\n    \"Since parentheses are distinguishable, after calculating the number of valid combinations of arrangements of parenthesis pairs, you must multiply the result by `Y!` (factorial of the number of parenthesis pairs), because each arrangement can have its parentheses ordered in Y! different ways. Similarly, consider cases for placing brackets.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
