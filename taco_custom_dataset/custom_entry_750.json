Rabbit wants to win at ICPC, so he decided to practice today as well.\\n\\nToday's training is to quickly solve popular puzzles and train your instantaneous power. Today's challenge is a puzzle of colorful tiles lined up and erasing them well.\\n\\nIn the initial state, tiles are placed on some squares on the grid. Each tile is colored. After the game starts, the player can perform the operations shown in the following procedure many times.\\n\\n1. Select one square without tiles and hit that square.\\n2. Follow from the hit square to the top, and pay attention to the tile when you reach the square where the tile is placed. If you get to the edge of the board without the squares on which the tiles are placed, you will not pay attention to anything.\\n3. Perform the same operation from the square you hit to the bottom, left, and right. Up to 4 tiles will be the focus of attention.\\n4. If any of the tiles of interest have the same color, remove those tiles from the board. If there are two pairs of tiles of the same color, remove both.\\n5. The score will be the same as the number of tiles removed.\\n6. Stop paying attention.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor example, consider the following situation. The squares without tiles are periods, and the tile colors are represented by uppercase letters.\\n\\n\\n..A ......\\n.......B..\\n..........\\n..B ......\\n..A.CC....\\n\\n\\nNow consider the operation of hitting the squares in the second row from the top and the third column from the left. Since there are three tiles of interest, `A`,` B`, and `B`, the two of` B` disappear and the board becomes as follows, and two points are obtained.\\n\\n\\n..A ......\\n..........\\n..........\\n..........\\n..A.CC....\\n\\n\\nIf this puzzle is slow, the time will run out, and you will not be able to see part of the board and you will not know how much training you lacked. Two tiles of each color are placed, but it is not always possible to erase all of them, so let the program calculate the maximum score in advance.\\n\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\nM N\\nC1,1 C1,2 ... C1, N\\nC2,1 C2,2 ... C2, N\\n...\\nCM, 1CM, 2 ... CM, N\\n\\nThe integers M and N indicate that the board is a grid of vertical M x horizontal N. Ci and j are uppercase letters or periods (`.`), And for the cells in the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left, the uppercase letters indicate the color of the tiles placed, and the period indicates the color of the tile. Indicates that no tile is placed on this square.\\n\\nSatisfy 1 \u2264 M \u2264 500 and 1 \u2264 N \u2264 500. Each uppercase letter appears as 0 or 2 as you type.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nOutput the maximum score on one line.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nInput\\n\\n5 10\\n..A.......\\n.......B..\\n..........\\n..B.......\\n..A.CC....\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n3 3\\nABC\\nD.D\\nCBA\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n5 7\\nNUTUBOR\\nQT.SZRQ\\nSANAGIP\\nLMDGZBM\\nKLKIODP\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n34\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import math, string, itertools, fractions, heapq, collections, re, array, bisect, sys, random, time, copy, functools\\nsys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 7)\\ninf = 10 ** 20\\neps = 1.0 / 10 ** 10\\nmod = 10 ** 9 + 7\\ndd = [(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1)]\\nddn = [(-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 0), (1, -1), (0, -1), (-1, -1)]\\n\\ndef LI():\\n\\treturn [int(x) for x in sys.stdin.readline().split()]\\n\\ndef LI_():\\n\\treturn [int(x) - 1 for x in sys.stdin.readline().split()]\\n\\ndef LF():\\n\\treturn [float(x) for x in sys.stdin.readline().split()]\\n\\ndef LS():\\n\\treturn sys.stdin.readline().split()\\n\\ndef I():\\n\\treturn int(sys.stdin.readline())\\n\\ndef F():\\n\\treturn float(sys.stdin.readline())\\n\\ndef S():\\n\\treturn input()\\n\\ndef pf(s):\\n\\treturn print(s, flush=True)\\n\\ndef main():\\n\\t(m, n) = LI()\\n\\ta = [[c for c in S()] for _ in range(m)]\\n\\tad = collections.defaultdict(list)\\n\\tfor i in range(m):\\n\\t\\tfor j in range(n):\\n\\t\\t\\tif a[i][j] != '.':\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tad[a[i][j]].append((i, j))\\n\\tps = set(map(tuple, ad.values()))\\n\\tf = True\\n\\tr = 0\\n\\twhile f:\\n\\t\\tf = False\\n\\t\\tfor (pa, pb) in list(ps):\\n\\t\\t\\t(i1, j1) = pa\\n\\t\\t\\t(i2, j2) = pb\\n\\t\\t\\tif i1 == i2:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tff = abs(j1 - j2) > 1\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor j in range(min(j1, j2) + 1, max(j1, j2)):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tif a[i1][j] != '.':\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tff = False\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif ff:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tf = True\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ta[i1][j1] = '.'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ta[i2][j2] = '.'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tps.remove((pa, pb))\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tr += 2\\n\\t\\t\\telif j1 == j2:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tff = abs(i1 - i2) > 1\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor i in range(min(i1, i2) + 1, max(i1, i2)):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tif a[i][j1] != '.':\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tff = False\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif ff:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tf = True\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ta[i1][j1] = '.'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ta[i2][j2] = '.'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tps.remove((pa, pb))\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tr += 2\\n\\t\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(i, j) = (i1, j2)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tff = a[i][j] == '.'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor j3 in range(min(j, j1) + 1, max(j, j1)):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tif a[i][j3] != '.':\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tff = False\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor i3 in range(min(i, i2) + 1, max(i, i2)):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tif a[i3][j] != '.':\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tff = False\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif ff:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tf = True\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ta[i1][j1] = '.'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ta[i2][j2] = '.'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tps.remove((pa, pb))\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tr += 2\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcontinue\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(i, j) = (i2, j1)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tff = a[i][j] == '.'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor j3 in range(min(j, j2) + 1, max(j, j2)):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tif a[i][j3] != '.':\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tff = False\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor i3 in range(min(i, i1) + 1, max(i, i1)):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tif a[i3][j] != '.':\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tff = False\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif ff:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tf = True\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ta[i1][j1] = '.'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ta[i2][j2] = '.'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tps.remove((pa, pb))\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tr += 2\\n\\treturn r\\nprint(main())\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem describes a game played on a grid with colored tiles. The goal is to maximize the score by removing pairs of tiles of the same color by hitting empty squares.\\n- Identifying Constraints and Rules: The grid size is limited (500x500). Each color appears exactly twice or zero times. Tiles are removed only if they are in the same row or column, or diagonally reachable with only empty spaces in between.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: The optimal strategy is to find pairs of tiles that can be removed and remove them iteratively until no more pairs can be removed. A greedy approach can be used.\\n- Handling Tile Removal Conditions: Tiles can be removed if there is a hit in line vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Therefore, checking the positions using a set of valid pairs is correct.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you efficiently find pairs of tiles with the same color?\",\n    \"How do you determine if two tiles can be removed after a hit on a particular square?\",\n    \"How would you handle the constraint that each color appears exactly twice or zero times?\",\n    \"How do you ensure that you find the maximum possible score?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Use a dictionary or hashmap to store the positions of each tile color. Iterate through the grid, and for each tile, check if a pair exists in the dictionary.\",\n    \"Check if they are in the same row or column with only empty spaces between them, or if there's an empty space diagonal where it is possible to hit and remove.\",\n    \"If a color appears only once or more than twice, ignore it since no pairs are possible.\",\n    \"Iteratively remove pairs of tiles until no more tiles can be removed. Since each color appear at most twice, repeatedly removing tiles as long as possible using a greedy strategy works here.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
