His greenhouse is very narrow and can be viewed as an infinite line, with each plant occupying a single point on that line.\\n\\nEmuskald has discovered that each species thrives at a different temperature, so he wants to arrange m - 1 borders that would divide the greenhouse into m sections numbered from 1 to m from left to right with each section housing a single species. He is free to place the borders, but in the end all of the i-th species plants must reside in i-th section from the left.\\n\\nOf course, it is not always possible to place the borders in such way, so Emuskald needs to replant some of his plants. He can remove each plant from its position and place it anywhere in the greenhouse (at any real coordinate) with no plant already in it. Since replanting is a lot of stress for the plants, help Emuskald find the minimum number of plants he has to replant to be able to place the borders.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 5000, n \u2265 m), the number of plants and the number of different species. Each of the following n lines contain two space-separated numbers: one integer number s_{i} (1 \u2264 s_{i} \u2264 m), and one real number x_{i} (0 \u2264 x_{i} \u2264 10^9), the species and position of the i-th plant. Each x_{i} will contain no more than 6 digits after the decimal point.\\n\\nIt is guaranteed that all x_{i} are different; there is at least one plant of each species; the plants are given in order \\\"from left to the right\\\", that is in the ascending order of their x_{i} coordinates (x_{i} < x_{i} + 1, 1 \u2264 i < n).\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nOutput a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of plants to be replanted.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n3 2\\n2 1\\n1 2.0\\n1 3.100\\n\\nOutput\\n1\\n\\nInput\\n3 3\\n1 5.0\\n2 5.5\\n3 6.0\\n\\nOutput\\n0\\n\\nInput\\n6 3\\n1 14.284235\\n2 17.921382\\n1 20.328172\\n3 20.842331\\n1 25.790145\\n1 27.204125\\n\\nOutput\\n2\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first test case, Emuskald can replant the first plant to the right of the last plant, so the answer is 1.\\n\\nIn the second test case, the species are already in the correct order, so no replanting is needed.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"(n, m) = map(int, input().split())\\nb = [list(map(float, input().split())) for i in range(n)]\\nk = [0] * n\\nk[0] = 1\\nfor i in range(1, n):\\n\\tz = 0\\n\\tfor y in range(i):\\n\\t\\tif b[y][0] <= b[i][0]:\\n\\t\\t\\tz = max(k[y], z)\\n\\tk[i] = max(0, z) + 1\\nprint(n - max(k))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires minimizing the number of replanted plants to arrange them so the i-th species occupies the i-th section of the greenhouse.\\n- Recognizing the Constraint: The plants are initially sorted by their x coordinates. The species s_i needs to be in section s_i.\\n- Identifying the Approach: This problem can be solved by finding the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the species.  The plants in this subsequence don't need to be replanted. Then, the answer is simply the total number of plants minus the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\\n- Constructing the LNDS: Iterate through the species of each plant. For each plant, find the maximum length of a non-decreasing subsequence that ends at that plant.\\n- Calculating the Result: Subtract the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence from the total number of plants.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the core problem that needs to be solved to minimize the number of replanted plants?\",\n    \"Why is the initial ordering of plants by their x coordinates important, and how does it affect the solution?\",\n    \"How can the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) concept be applied to solve this problem?\",\n    \"What does it mean for a subsequence to be non-decreasing in the context of plant species?\",\n    \"How do you keep track of the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence as you iterate through the plants, and what data structure would be appropriate for this?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The core problem is to find the minimum number of plants to replant so that each plant species occupies its corresponding section in the greenhouse.\",\n    \"The initial ordering ensures that we only need to consider the order of species (s_i), since the plants are already arranged by position. This simplifies the problem to finding a specific kind of subsequence.\",\n    \"The longest non-decreasing subsequence identifies the maximum number of plants that are already in the correct order and therefore don't need to be replanted.\",\n    \"In the context of plant species, a non-decreasing subsequence means that the species numbers in the subsequence are in ascending order or remain the same. So, for example 1, 2, 2, 3 is a valid non-decreasing sequence\",\n    \"You can keep track of the length of the LNDS using dynamic programming. An array k, where k[i] stores the length of the LNDS ending at index i, can be used.  For each plant, you iterate through the previous plants and update k[i] based on whether the species number is greater than or equal to the species number of the previous plant.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
