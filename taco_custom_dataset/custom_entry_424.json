"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"You are given a string $s$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters \\\"a\\\", \\\"b\\\" and \\\"c\\\" and question marks \\\"?\\\".\\n\\nLet the number of question marks in the string $s$ be $k$. Let's replace each question mark with one of the letters \\\"a\\\", \\\"b\\\" and \\\"c\\\". Here we can obtain all $3^{k}$ possible strings consisting only of letters \\\"a\\\", \\\"b\\\" and \\\"c\\\". For example, if $s = $\\\"ac?b?c\\\" then we can obtain the following strings: $[$\\\"acabac\\\", \\\"acabbc\\\", \\\"acabcc\\\", \\\"acbbac\\\", \\\"acbbbc\\\", \\\"acbbcc\\\", \\\"accbac\\\", \\\"accbbc\\\", \\\"accbcc\\\"$]$.\\n\\nYour task is to count the total number of subsequences \\\"abc\\\" in all resulting strings. Since the answer can be very large, print it modulo $10^{9} + 7$.\\n\\nA subsequence of the string $t$ is such a sequence that can be derived from the string $t$ after removing some (possibly, zero) number of letters without changing the order of remaining letters. For example, the string \\\"baacbc\\\" contains two subsequences \\\"abc\\\" \u2014 a subsequence consisting of letters at positions $(2, 5, 6)$ and a subsequence consisting of letters at positions $(3, 5, 6)$.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $n$ $(3 \\\\le n \\\\le 200\\\\,000)$ \u2014 the length of $s$.\\n\\nThe second line of the input contains the string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters \\\"a\\\", \\\"b\\\" and \\\"c\\\" and question marks\\\"?\\\".\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nPrint the total number of subsequences \\\"abc\\\" in all strings you can obtain if you replace all question marks with letters \\\"a\\\", \\\"b\\\" and \\\"c\\\", modulo $10^{9} + 7$.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n6\\nac?b?c\\n\\nOutput\\n24\\n\\nInput\\n7\\n???????\\n\\nOutput\\n2835\\n\\nInput\\n9\\ncccbbbaaa\\n\\nOutput\\n0\\n\\nInput\\n5\\na???c\\n\\nOutput\\n46\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first example, we can obtain $9$ strings:  \\\"acabac\\\" \u2014 there are $2$ subsequences \\\"abc\\\",  \\\"acabbc\\\" \u2014 there are $4$ subsequences \\\"abc\\\",  \\\"acabcc\\\" \u2014 there are $4$ subsequences \\\"abc\\\",  \\\"acbbac\\\" \u2014 there are $2$ subsequences \\\"abc\\\",  \\\"acbbbc\\\" \u2014 there are $3$ subsequences \\\"abc\\\",  \\\"acbbcc\\\" \u2014 there are $4$ subsequences \\\"abc\\\",  \\\"accbac\\\" \u2014 there is $1$ subsequence \\\"abc\\\",  \\\"accbbc\\\" \u2014 there are $2$ subsequences \\\"abc\\\",  \\\"accbcc\\\" \u2014 there are $2$ subsequences \\\"abc\\\". \\n\\nSo, there are $2 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 24$ subsequences \\\"abc\\\" in total.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def solve(s, n):\\n\\ta = 0\\n\\tab = 0\\n\\tabc = 0\\n\\taTimes = 1\\n\\tfor i in range(s):\\n\\t\\tif n[i] == 'a':\\n\\t\\t\\ta += aTimes\\n\\t\\t\\ta = a % mod\\n\\t\\telif n[i] == 'b':\\n\\t\\t\\tab += a\\n\\t\\t\\tab = ab % mod\\n\\t\\telif n[i] == 'c':\\n\\t\\t\\tabc += ab\\n\\t\\t\\tabc = abc % mod\\n\\t\\telif n[i] == '?':\\n\\t\\t\\tabc = (3 * abc + ab) % mod\\n\\t\\t\\tab = (3 * ab + a) % mod\\n\\t\\t\\ta = (3 * a + aTimes) % mod\\n\\t\\t\\taTimes = aTimes * 3 % mod\\n\\treturn abc\\nmod = 10 ** 9 + 7\\ns = int(input())\\nn = input()\\nprint(solve(s, n))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires us to count the number of \\\"abc\\\" subsequences in all possible strings derived from the input string by replacing each '?' with 'a', 'b', or 'c'. The final answer needs to be modulo $10^9 + 7$.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Since there can be up to $3^k$ possible strings, where $k$ is the number of question marks, and the number of subsequences can grow quickly, directly generating all strings and counting subsequences for each is not feasible due to time limit constraints. Modulo operation is crucial to prevent integer overflow.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Dynamic programming seems appropriate. We can maintain counts of 'a', 'ab', and 'abc' subsequences as we iterate through the string. When we encounter a '?', we multiply our current counts by 3 and also add the prior count appropriately.\\n- Implementing DP: We iterate through the string. If we see 'a', we update the count of 'a'. If we see 'b', we update 'ab', and if we see 'c', we update 'abc'. If we see '?', it means each subsequence ('a', 'ab', 'abc') will be tripled and augmented by the previous subsequence.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for a string to contain a subsequence \\\"abc\\\"?\",\n    \"Why can't we just generate all possible strings and then count subsequences?\",\n    \"How should the modulo operation be applied to prevent overflow?\",\n    \"How does the presence of a question mark affect the count of subsequences?\",\n    \"Can you describe how to implement a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem efficiently?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A string contains a subsequence \\\"abc\\\" if there exist indices i < j < k such that s[i] = 'a', s[j] = 'b', and s[k] = 'c'.\",\n    \"Generating all possible strings is computationally infeasible when the input string contains many question marks, as the number of strings grows exponentially with the number of question marks.\",\n    \"The modulo operation (mod $10^9 + 7$) should be applied after each arithmetic operation (addition, multiplication) to keep the intermediate and final results within the integer range and avoid overflow.\",\n    \"A question mark can be replaced by 'a', 'b', or 'c'. Therefore, the counts of 'a', 'ab', and 'abc' subsequences need to be updated by considering all three possibilities.\",\n    \"A dynamic programming approach involves iterating through the string and maintaining counts of 'a', 'ab', and 'abc' subsequences.  When encountering a character, the counts are updated based on that character. Specifically, when encountering a question mark, each of those counts is multiplied by 3 and augmented by the previous appropriate count.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
