The second line must be parsed into a list of integers.\\n- Calculation: Determine that built-in functions such as `min()`, `max()`, and `sum()` can be used to find the minimum, maximum, and sum of the integer list, respectively.\\n- Output Formatting: Understand that the output should consist of the minimum, maximum, and sum, separated by single spaces.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How should the input be processed to extract the integers into a usable list?\",\n    \"What built-in Python functions are suitable for finding the minimum, maximum, and sum of a list?\",\n    \"How can the output be formatted to meet the problem's requirement of space-separated values?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The input can be read as a string and split into individual strings, and then each string can be converted to an integer and stored in a list using a list comprehension.\",\n    \"The built-in functions `min()`, `max()`, and `sum()` can directly calculate the minimum, maximum, and sum of a list of numbers, respectively.\",\n    \"The `print()` function can output multiple values separated by spaces by passing them as separate arguments: `print(min_value, max_value, sum_value)`.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
