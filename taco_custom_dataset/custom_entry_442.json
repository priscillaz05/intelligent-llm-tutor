Player $1$ always plays first, and the two players move in alternating turns. The game's rules are as follows:\\n\\nIn a single move, a player can remove either $2$, $3$, or $5$ stones from the game board. \\nIf a player is unable to make a move, that player loses the game.\\n\\nGiven the starting number of stones, find and print the name of the winner.  $\\\\mathbf{P1}$ is named First and $\\\\textbf{P2}$ is named Second.  Each player plays optimally, meaning they will not make a move that causes them to lose the game if a winning move exists.\\n\\nFor example, if $n=4$, $\\\\mathbf{P1}$ can make the following moves:  \\n\\n$\\\\mathbf{P1}$ removes $2$ stones leaving $2$. $\\\\textbf{P2}$ will then remove $2$ stones and win.\\n$\\\\mathbf{P1}$ removes $3$ stones leaving $1$. $\\\\textbf{P2}$ cannot move and loses.\\n\\n$\\\\mathbf{P1}$ would make the second play and win the game.\\n\\nFunction Description\\n\\nComplete the gameOfStones function in the editor below.

The player unable to make a move loses. Players play optimally.\\n- Identifying Base Cases: Analyze small values of $n$ to determine who wins for $n = 1, 2, 3, ...$ and observe patterns.\\n- Determining Optimal Moves: Realize that a player wins if they can make a move that leaves the opponent in a losing state. A player loses if all possible moves lead to the opponent winning.\\n- Identifying Winning and Losing States: A winning state is a number of stones from which the current player can force a win. A losing state is a number of stones from which the current player will always lose if the other player plays optimally.\\n- Dynamic Programming Approach: Use a dynamic programming approach to build a table of winning and losing states for n from 1 to 100.\\n- Simplification: Notice that the winner is determined by whether n is a multiple of 7. If n % 7 equals 0 or 1, the second player wins, otherwise the first player wins. This is an incorrect simplification, but helpful in illustrating thought process.\\n- Correct Solution and Pattern Recognition: Observe outputs for $n = 1$ to $n = 10$ to create lists First and Second that keep track of who wins given $n$ stones. Iterate from $n=11$ to $n=100$ and append the value to either list based on checking if the other player losing results in the current player winning.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for a player to play optimally in this context?\",\n    \"What are the base cases for small values of n, and how do they influence the outcome of the game?\",\n    \"How can you determine whether a given state (number of stones) is a winning or losing state?\",\n    \"How can Dynamic Programming be used to determine the winner in this game?\",\n    \"Is there any mathematical relationship between n and the winner of the game that could simplify the problem?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Playing optimally means that if a player has a move that will guarantee their win, they will make that move. Otherwise, they will make a move that gives their opponent the least advantage.\",\n    \"The base cases are the values of n for which the winner can be determined directly. For example, if n=1, the first player loses since they cannot make a move. If n=2, the first player wins by removing 2 stones. These base cases can be used to build up to solve larger problems.\",\n    \"A state is a winning state if the current player can make a move that leads to a losing state for the opponent. A state is a losing state if every possible move leads to a winning state for the opponent.\",\n    \"Dynamic Programming can be used to build a table indicating whether each number of stones n is a winning or losing state. Start with the base cases and then iterate from n=2 to n=100. For each n, check if any of the possible moves (n-2, n-3, n-5) lead to a losing state for the opponent. If so, then n is a winning state.\",\n    \"While it might be tempting to look for patterns such as 'if n % 7 equals 0 or 1, the second player wins, otherwise the first player wins,' this is not correct. Observing the outputs and manually calculating the game will allow you to define the winning/losing states as you create your code.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
