Xsquare's character set contains only lower case alphabets more specifically characters from 'a' to 'z' (both inclusive).

Come on , you are already familiar with these sequences. If in case you are not. Please, Have a look at this link\\n\\nFascinated with these sequences, Xsquare starts thinking how many distinct interesting sequences of length N are possible if he would have infinite number of each character in the character set.\\n\\nXsquare thinks he is very good at counting and starts counting the number of such sequences for a given length N on his fingers.\\n\\nCan you help him by verifying his answer.

Since the sequence must be a palindrome, we only need to determine the first half of the sequence, as the second half is determined by the first. The length N can be very large, so an efficient method for exponentiation is required.\\n- Identify Core Concepts: Palindromic sequences, exponentiation, modulo arithmetic.\\n- Strategy Selection: The number of possible palindromes of length N is 26^((N+1)/2) if N is odd, and 26^(N/2) if N is even.  We can combine these as 26^ceil(N/2).  Use binary exponentiation to efficiently calculate the power modulo (10^9 + 9).\\n- Edge Cases: N can be very large (up to 10^18), so the calculation needs to be done using an efficient method like binary exponentiation to avoid timeouts. The result must be calculated modulo (10^9 + 9).\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for a sequence to be a palindrome, and how does this constraint help in calculating the number of possible sequences?\",\n    \"How can we efficiently compute large powers, such as 26 raised to a large exponent, modulo a given number?\",\n    \"How do we calculate the exponent to which we need to raise 26, based on the length of the sequence N?\",\n    \"What is the significance of calculating the result modulo (10^9 + 9), and why is this important in this problem?\",\n    \"What edge cases or constraints should we consider when implementing the power modulo function?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A palindrome reads the same forwards and backward. Thus, determining the first half of the sequence fully determines the entire sequence. We only need to determine ceil(N/2) characters.\",\n    \"Binary exponentiation allows us to calculate powers in O(log N) time, which is essential for handling large exponents.\",\n    \"The exponent to which we raise 26 is (N+1)/2 when N is odd and N/2 when N is even, which can be generalized to ceil(N/2).\",\n    \"Calculating the result modulo (10^9 + 9) prevents integer overflow, especially when dealing with large exponents. It ensures the answer remains within a manageable range.\",\n    \"Edge cases to consider: base or modulus less than 1, exponent can be zero, exponent is large and needs efficient calculation using binary exponentiation.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
