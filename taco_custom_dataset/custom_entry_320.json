The initial rate of printing the currency is $P$ dollars per day and they increase the production by $Q$ dollars after every interval of $d$ days. For example, after $d$ days the rate is $P+Q$ dollars per day, and after $2d$ days the rate is $P+2Q$ dollars per day, and so on.

Each interval leads to an increased printing rate, so the money printed in each interval needs to be calculated based on the rate at that point.\",\n    \"I would use the arithmetic progression formula to calculate the sum of money printed during these intervals, as the rate increases by Q for each interval. Specifically, the sum of an arithmetic series = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d], where n is the number of intervals, a is the initial rate (P), and d is the increment (Q). Multiply this sum by 'd' to account for the number of days in each interval.\",\n    \"For the remaining days (D % d), the printing rate is P + quo * Q (where quo is D // d). Multiply this rate by the remaining days to find the total money printed during that period.\",\n    \"Given the constraints, int should be sufficient. However, it's good practice to be mindful of potential overflows, especially when multiplying large numbers.
