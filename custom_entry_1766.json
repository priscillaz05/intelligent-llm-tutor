"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"You are the \\\"computer expert\\\" of a local Athletic Association (C.A.A.).\\nMany teams of runners come to compete. Each time you get a string of \\nall race results of every team who has run.\\nFor example here is a string showing the individual results of a team of 5 runners:\\n\\n` \\\"01|15|59, 1|47|6, 01|17|20, 1|32|34, 2|3|17\\\" `\\n\\nEach part of the string is of the form: ` h|m|s `\\nwhere h, m, s (h for hour, m for minutes, s for seconds) are positive or null integer (represented as strings) with one or two digits.\\nThere are no traps in this format.\\n\\nTo compare the results of the teams you are asked for giving\\nthree statistics; **range, average and median**.\\n\\n`Range` : difference between the lowest and highest values. \\nIn {4, 6, 9, 3, 7} the lowest value is 3, and the highest is 9, \\nso the range is 9 \u2212 3 = 6.\\n\\n`Mean or Average` : To calculate mean, add together all of the numbers \\nin a set and then divide the sum by the total count of numbers.\\n\\n`Median` : In statistics, the median is the number separating the higher half \\nof a data sample from the lower half. \\nThe median of a finite list of numbers can be found by arranging all \\nthe observations from lowest value to highest value and picking the middle one \\n(e.g., the median of {3, 3, 5, 9, 11} is 5) when there is an odd number of observations. \\nIf there is an even number of observations, then there is no single middle value; \\nthe median is then defined to be the mean of the two middle values\\n(the median of {3, 5, 6, 9} is (5 + 6) / 2 = 5.5).\\n\\nYour task is to return a string giving these 3 values.  For the example given above,\\nthe string result will be\\n\\n`\\\"Range: 00|47|18 Average: 01|35|15 Median: 01|32|34\\\"`\\n\\nof the form:\\n\\n`\\\"Range: hh|mm|ss Average: hh|mm|ss Median: hh|mm|ss\\\"`\\n\\nwhere hh, mm, ss are integers (represented by strings) with *each 2 digits*.\\n\\n*Remarks*: \\n\\n1. if a result in seconds is ab.xy... it will be given **truncated** as ab.\\n\\n2. if the given string is \\\"\\\" you will return \\\"\\\"\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def stat(strg):\\n\\n\\tdef get_time(s):\\n\\t\\t(hh, mm, ss) = [int(v) for v in s.split('|')]\\n\\t\\treturn hh * 3600 + mm * 60 + ss\\n\\n\\tdef format_time(time):\\n\\t\\thh = time // 3600\\n\\t\\tmm = time // 60 % 60\\n\\t\\tss = time % 60\\n\\t\\treturn '{hh:02d}|{mm:02d}|{ss:02d}'.format(**locals())\\n\\n\\tdef get_range(times):\\n\\t\\treturn times[-1] - times[0]\\n\\n\\tdef get_average(times):\\n\\t\\treturn sum(times) // len(times)\\n\\n\\tdef get_median(times):\\n\\t\\tmiddle = len(times) >> 1\\n\\t\\treturn times[middle] if len(times) & 1 else (times[middle - 1] + times[middle]) // 2\\n\\tif strg == '':\\n\\t\\treturn strg\\n\\ttimes = [get_time(s) for s in strg.split(', ')]\\n\\ttimes.sort()\\n\\trng = format_time(get_range(times))\\n\\tavg = format_time(get_average(times))\\n\\tmdn = format_time(get_median(times))\\n\\treturn 'Range: {rng} Average: {avg} Median: {mdn}'.format(**locals())\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding Problem Constraints: The input is a string containing race times in the format \\\"hh|mm|ss\\\". Need to compute the range, average, and median of these times, formatted as \\\"hh|mm|ss\\\". Special cases: empty input string and truncation of seconds.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: Parsing times correctly is important. The input times are strings and must be converted to integers. Need to convert times to seconds to make calculations simpler. Average and median calculations need to handle integer division. Formatting the output string must have leading zeros for hours, minutes, and seconds.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Split the input string into individual times. Convert each time to seconds. Sort the times to easily calculate the range and median. Calculate the range (max - min). Calculate the average (sum / count). Calculate the median (middle value or average of two middle values, handling even vs. odd number of times). Convert range, average, and median back into \\\"hh|mm|ss\\\" format. Construct the output string.\\n- Implementing In-Place Modification: Times should be converted into total seconds for calculations. Using helper functions for conversion between \u201chh|mm|ss\u201d and seconds will keep the main function clean.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you convert the time string \\\"hh|mm|ss\\\" into total seconds and vice versa?\",\n    \"How do you handle the case when the input string is empty?\",\n    \"What approach do you use to find the median when the number of times is even versus odd?\",\n    \"How do you format the output with leading zeros to ensure \\\"hh|mm|ss\\\" format?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the range, given the list of times?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"To convert \\\"hh|mm|ss\\\" to total seconds, parse each part, and then calculate hh * 3600 + mm * 60 + ss. To convert total seconds back to \\\"hh|mm|ss\\\", use integer division and modulo operations: hh = total_seconds // 3600, mm = (total_seconds % 3600) // 60, ss = total_seconds % 60.\",\n    \"If the input string is empty, return an empty string.\",\n    \"If there's an odd number of times, the median is the middle element after sorting.
