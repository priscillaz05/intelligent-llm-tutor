A digital clock shows time in the format HH:MM:SS, where HH, MM, SS represents hours , minutes, and seconds respectively. It is a 24 hour clock and so the day starts at 00:00:00 hours while it ends at 23:59:59.\\n\\nWe all know how punctual and particular Chandan is about each and every second of his life. One sunny day, at his leisure, when he was fiddling with his clock, he discovered that a second was good for him if none of the HH, MM\\\\; and \\\\; SS at that second was divisible by the same prime number, i.e. it is bad if all of them give 0 as a remainder when divided by the same prime number. \\n\\nGiven a time of a day, Chandan now wants to count the number of good times and bad times from that instance till the end of the day (23:59:59). \\n\\nInput & Output:\\nThe first line of the input contains the number of test cases T. T test cases follow and each test contains a line HH MM SS, the time from which he wants to count till the end of that day. \\n\\nFor each test case, output a ratio in the format \\\"B:G\\\" (quotes for clarity), where G is the the number of good seconds and B is the number of bad seconds for Chandan. Express the ratio B : G in its lowest terms, i.e. it should not have any common factor.\\n\\nConstraints\\n\\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 10 ^ 5\\n00 \u2264 HH < 24\\n00 \u2264 MM < 60\\n00 \u2264 SS < 60  \\n\\nSAMPLE INPUT\\n2\\n23 59 58\\n23 46 22\\n\\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\\n0:2\\n1:408\\n\\nExplanation\\n\\n1) In the first case, there 23:59:59 is good because there is no prime number that leaves a remainder 0 when it divides all of them. Similarly 23:59:58 is also good. Hence the answer is 0:2\\n\\n2) In the second case, there are two bad numbers, 23:46:23 (leaves remainder 0 when divided by 23) and 23:46:46. There are 816 good numbers. Hence the answer is 2:816 => 1:408\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"primes=[2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59]\\narr=[0]*100000\\n\\ndef gcd(a,b):\\n\\tif a%b==0:\\n\\t\\treturn b\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\treturn gcd(b,a%b)\\n\\ndef to_sec(h,m,s):\\n\\treturn (h*60*60) + (m*60) + s\\ndef check_div(h,m,s):\\n\\tfor e in primes:\\n\\t\\tif h%e==0 and m%e==0 and s%e==0:\\n\\t\\t\\treturn False\\n\\treturn True\\n\\nfor h in range(24):\\n\\tfor m in range(60):\\n\\t\\tfor s in range(60):\\n\\t\\t\\tif check_div(h,m,s):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarr[to_sec(h,m,s)]+=1\\n\\nfor i in range(len(arr)-2,-1,-1):\\n\\tarr[i]+=arr[i+1]\\n\\t\\n\\nt=int(input())\\nfor i in range(t):\\n\\th,m,s=(int(e) for e in input().split())\\n\\tsec=to_sec(h,m,s)\\n\\tgood=arr[sec]\\n\\tbad=(24*60*60)-sec-good\\n\\ttemp=gcd(bad,good) if bad!=0 else 1\\n\\tprint(\\\"%d:%d\\\"%(bad/temp,good/temp))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires counting \\\"good\\\" and \\\"bad\\\" seconds from a given time until the end of the day (23:59:59). A second is \\\"bad\\\" if HH, MM, and SS are all divisible by the same prime number, and \\\"good\\\" otherwise. The final answer needs to be in the format B:G, reduced to the lowest terms.\\n- Identifying Key Primes: Recognize that only prime numbers less than or equal to max(HH,MM,SS) needs to be considered. Need to predefine a list of prime numbers, and convert the given HH MM SS format to a single number representing number of seconds elapsed since 00:00:00.\\n- Devise an Efficient Counting Method: A brute-force method of iterating through each second and checking its \\\"goodness\\\" will be too slow. Consider a dynamic programming or pre-computation approach.\\n- GCD Calculation: Remember to reduce the fraction B:G to its lowest terms using the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD). Implement a GCD function, either iteratively or recursively.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can the time format HH:MM:SS be converted into a single numerical representation of seconds?\",\n    \"What are the upper limits for the range of prime numbers to check for divisibility?\",\n    \"How can the number of \\\"good\\\" and \\\"bad\\\" seconds be efficiently calculated without brute-force iteration?\",\n    \"How is the greatest common divisor (GCD) calculated, and why is it crucial for the problem?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases, and how do they affect the calculation of the final ratio?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The time can be converted to seconds using the formula: total_seconds = (HH * 3600) + (MM * 60) + SS.\",\n    \"The prime numbers to check for divisibility should be less than or equal to the maximum of HH, MM, and SS for that specific time instance.\",\n    \"A pre-computation or dynamic programming approach can avoid brute-force.

Reducing the ratio B:G to its lowest terms requires dividing both B and G by their GCD.\",\n    \"Edge cases include when either B or G is zero, which requires special handling in the GCD calculation to avoid division by zero or incorrect ratios (e.g., 0:x simplifies to 0:1, and x:0 should be 1:0 when both numbers are reduced to their lowest terms. In general, handle the gcd(0,x) where x !=0 case.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
