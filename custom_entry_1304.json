There are two types of bouquets: single-color bouquets (requiring 3 flowers of the same color) and mixing bouquets (requiring 1 of each color).\\n- Identifying Optimization Strategy: Realize that creating mixing bouquets first might be optimal if the numbers of each color are relatively balanced. Otherwise, it might be better to create as many single-color bouquets as possible before considering mixing bouquets.\\n- Exploring Edge Cases: Consider the cases where one or more of the flower counts is zero. Also, consider what happens if the flower counts are significantly different from each other.\\n- Implementing an Algorithmic Approach: Consider how to balance the creation of both single-color and mixing bouquets. One approach is to start by making as many mixing bouquets as possible (limited by the minimum number of flowers available) and then using the remaining flowers to create single-color bouquets. Another approach involves calculating the total number of bouquets made by each color, then calculate the total number of bouquets made by mixing them.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the core problem objective, and what constraints affect the solution?\",\n    \"How can you determine whether to prioritize creating single-color bouquets or mixing bouquets?\",\n    \"What are the key edge cases that need to be considered and addressed in the algorithm?\",\n    \"How would you approach balancing the creation of single-color and mixing bouquets to maximize total bouquets?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The objective is to maximize the number of bouquets made, given the number of red, green, and blue flowers. Constraints include the limited number of each color and the different flower requirements for each bouquet type.\",\n    \"You can compare the flower counts. If the numbers are close, prioritizing mixing bouquets might be better. If one or more colors are scarce, prioritize using the others for single-color bouquets.\",\n    \"Key edge cases include scenarios where one or more flower counts are zero, which means no mixing bouquets can be made. Also, the case where one color count is substantially lower than others will limit the number of mixing bouquets.\",\n    \"One approach is to start by making as many mixing bouquets as possible, limited by the minimum number of flowers, and then use the remaining flowers for single-color bouquets. Alternatively, several cases can be computed with 0, 1, or 2 mixing bouquets initially and then maximize the remaining flowers into same color bouquets.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
