The goal is to implement a `Cashier` class that calculates the bill for a customer, applying a discount if the customer is the nth customer.\\n- Data Structures: A dictionary should be used to store products and their prices for quick lookup. The cashier also needs to track the number of customers to determine when to apply the discount.\\n- Algorithm for getBill: Increment the customer count. Calculate the subtotal by multiplying the price of each product by the quantity ordered and summing them up. If the current customer count is equal to n, apply the discount and reset the counter. Return the final bill amount.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What data structures are suitable for storing product IDs and their corresponding prices, and what are the trade-offs?\",\n    \"How do you manage the customer count to ensure the discount is applied correctly to every nth customer?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the total bill amount for a customer, including handling the discount when applicable?\",\n    \"What edge cases or constraints should be considered during the implementation?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A dictionary (hash map) is suitable because it provides O(1) average time complexity for looking up prices by product ID. Alternatively, you could use a list of tuples or two separate lists for products and prices, but lookups would be less efficient (O(n) time complexity).\",\n    \"Maintain a counter that increments each time `getBill` is called. When the counter reaches n, apply the discount, reset the counter to 0. Modulo operator could be used to keep the counter within range.\",\n    \"Iterate through the list of products and amounts. For each product, multiply its price by its amount and add it to the subtotal. If the current customer is the nth customer, apply the discount by subtracting (discount * subtotal / 100) from the subtotal. Finally, return the subtotal.\",\n    \"Consider the case when the input lists `products` and `prices` are empty. Ensure that the product IDs in the `product` list are valid (i.e., they exist in the initial `products` list). Also, handle potential division by zero errors, though the problem constraints likely prevent this. Be mindful of the floating-point precision for the bill amount to meet the specified tolerance.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
