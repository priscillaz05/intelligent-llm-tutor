A Disarium number is one where the sum of its digits, each raised to the power of its position in the number, equals the number itself.\\n- Breaking Down the Number: The number N needs to be processed digit by digit. Converting N to a string will allow easy iteration and extraction of individual digits.\\n- Calculating the Sum: Iterate through each digit in the string representation of N. Convert each digit back to an integer. Calculate the digit raised to the power of its position. Add the result to an accumulator variable (summ).\\n- Comparing the Sum: After calculating the sum of powered digits, compare this sum with the original number N. If they are equal, the number is Disarium; otherwise, it is not.\\n- Implementing the Solution: Write the code to perform these steps. Be mindful of the starting position for calculating the power (starting from 1, not 0).\\n\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for a number to be a Disarium number, and what steps are needed to check if a given number is Disarium?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently access each digit of the number to compute the sum of digits raised to their respective positions?\",\n    \"How do you manage the index (position) of each digit while calculating the power, considering the position starts from 1, not 0?\",\n    \"What edge cases might be relevant, and how should they be handled in the solution?\",\n    \"What considerations are important to keep the space complexity at O(1)?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A number is Disarium if the sum of its digits raised to their respective positions equals the number itself. We need to extract each digit, calculate its power according to its position, sum these powers, and compare the sum with the original number.\",\n    \"Converting the number to a string allows easy iteration through its digits using a loop. Each character in the string can then be converted back to an integer.\",\n    \"The index (position) can be tracked using a counter variable that starts at 1 and increments with each digit.
