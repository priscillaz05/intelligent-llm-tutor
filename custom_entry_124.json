Note that K must be at least 1.\\n- Defining Primality Check: Determine an efficient approach to test whether a given number is prime. This typically involves checking for divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.\\n- Algorithmic Approach: Start with K = 1 and iteratively increment K until A + B + K results in either 1 or a prime number.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Although 1 is a possibility as the sum, ensure that the primality test handles the number 1 correctly (it should not be considered prime). Also, consider that A + B + K cannot be less than 3 since A and B both are atleast 1 and K is atleast 1.\\n- Efficiency Considerations: While the problem suggests an O(n log n) complexity, the constraints (A, B <= 1000) mean that a simpler primality check can be sufficient.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What exactly is the task trying to achieve, and what constraints must be met?\",\n    \"How can you determine if a number is prime, and what is the most efficient approach to check this within the given constraints?\",\n    \"Given that the third pile must have at least one pen, what is the starting value you should consider, and how will you increment it?\",\n    \"How should the primality test handle the number 1, given that the problem description allows for sum of all three piles equals to unity?\",\n    \"How can you optimize the search to stop as soon as the first valid value for K is found?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The task is to find the minimum number of pens (K) for the third pile, such that the total number of pens (A + B + K) is either equal to 1 or a prime number.
