The process should repeat until the operator is '?'.\\n- Handling Input: The input consists of multiple lines, each containing two integers and an operator separated by spaces. The input ends when the operator is '?'.\\n- Performing Operations: Based on the operator, perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, or integer division. Ensure integer division truncates any fractional part.\\n- Looping and Termination: Read and process input until the operator is '?'. Then, terminate the program.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How should the program handle the input format, and what steps are necessary to extract the numbers and the operator?\",\n    \"What data types are suitable for storing the input values, and how should they be converted if necessary?\",\n    \"How should the program determine which operation to perform based on the operator?\",\n    \"What specific operation should be performed for each operator ('+', '-', '*', '/')?\",\n    \"How should the program terminate the input loop when the operator is '?'?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The program should read each line, split it by spaces to separate the two numbers and the operator. It should store these values into appropriate variables.\",\n    \"Integers (int) are suitable for storing the input numbers. The input values, initially strings, must be converted to integers.\",\n    \"The program should use conditional statements (if/else if/else or switch case) to check the value of the operator and determine which operation to perform.\",\n    \"'+' should trigger addition, '-' should trigger subtraction, '*' should trigger multiplication, and '/' should trigger integer division (truncating any fractional part).\",\n    \"The program should use a 'break' statement to exit the input loop when the operator is equal to '?'.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
