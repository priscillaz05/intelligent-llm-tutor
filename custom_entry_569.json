For each number, find the count of its divisors. If the divisor count equals N, increment the result counter.\\n- Optimization: The time complexity is optimized by only iterating up to the square root of the number when finding divisors.

We should handle the edge case where N might be equal to 1 if A and B are 1, as 1 has only one divisor. If A or B is negative, we should specify to consider absolute values as number of divisors is not defined for negative integers.\",\n    \"Since the maximum value of B is 10^4, precomputing the number of divisors for each number from 1 to 10^4 can reduce the time complexity for divisor calculation from O(sqrt(B)) to O(1) for each number within the range [A, B].
