If $N = 4$, the divisors are $1, 2, $ and $4$.

The final sum should be calculated modulo 10^9 + 7.\\n- Identifying Core Concepts: The key is to efficiently determine all possible values of N after K operations and ensure that duplicate values are only counted once. Prime factorization and divisor calculation are fundamental.\\n- Choosing a Data Structure: A set can be used to store the distinct values of N to avoid duplicates.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: An iterative or recursive approach can be employed. In each iteration, calculate the divisors of the current N, multiply N by these divisors, and add the resulting values to the set. Repeat K times.\\n- Modulo Arithmetic: It is important to apply the modulo operation after each multiplication to prevent overflow and adhere to the constraints.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the initial approach to determine the divisors of N efficiently, given the large constraint on N?\",\n    \"How do you effectively use the prime factorization to avoid redundant calculations and ensure accurate divisor generation?\",\n    \"How should the K operations be simulated to ensure that the set contains only distinct numbers while adhering to the modulo constraint?\",\n    \"When calculating the power in the function calc, how can you make sure that the inverse modulo operation works correctly and does not return the wrong value?\",\n    \"How would you optimize the given code to improve runtime or handle edge cases?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Given N can be as large as 10^7, precomputing divisors or using prime factorization techniques like sieve of Eratosthenes can improve efficiency. Start by iterating from 2 to the square root of N to find divisors, and update prime factors in a dict/map.\",\n    \"By only using distinct values in our prime factorization, we can avoid many redundant computations for divisors, since each prime factor will only add divisors up to its power in the factorization, not arbitrarily higher values.

Starting from initial value N, on the first operation compute N*d for all divisors d of N, and store those values in a set. Then do the same on the second operation but starting from all the values in the set computed from previous steps. After K operations, we're left with a set of distinct numbers.
