It is guaranteed that there is only one second most frequent string.\\n- Counting String Frequencies: Use a dictionary (or hash map) to store the frequency of each string in the array. This involves iterating through the array and updating the count for each string in the dictionary.\\n- Identifying the Second Most Frequent String: Sort the dictionary items (string-frequency pairs) based on their frequencies.
