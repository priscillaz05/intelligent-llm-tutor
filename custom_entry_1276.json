Each shop was having one exclusive stone of value s[i] , where 1<=i<=n.  If number of stones collected are more than 1, then total value will be product of values of all the stones he collected. Ripul wants to have maximum value of stones he collected. Help Ripul in picking up the subarray which leads to maximum value of stones he collected.\\n\\n-----Input:-----\\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases.

If there are multiple such subarrays, we need to pick the one with the largest starting index. If starting indices are the same, choose the one with the largest ending index.\\n- Edge Cases and Constraints: The numbers in the array can be negative, zero, or positive. The size of the array can be up to 10^5, so we need to avoid inefficient solutions like O(n^3). The product can be large, so a 64-bit integer should be sufficient to store it. We also should handle edge cases like an empty array.\\n- Choosing an Algorithm Strategy: A brute force approach to check all subarrays would be O(n^2). We iterate through all possible starting indices i from 0 to n-1. For each i, we iterate through all possible ending indices j from i to n-1. Calculate the product of the subarray [i...j] and maintain the maximum product found so far, along with its indices.  Since we want to pick the subarray with largest starting index if there are duplicate values, so keep updating the result if the maximum value is the same, with condition that starting index is greater. If starting index is the same, keep updating the result if the ending index is greater.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What should be the approach if the array contains both positive and negative numbers?\",\n    \"How do you handle zero values in the array, and how do they affect the maximum product?\",\n    \"If multiple subarrays have the same maximum product, how do you select the correct subarray based on the problem requirements?\",\n    \"What is the time complexity of the brute force approach, and how can this affect the solution when the array size is large (up to 10^5)?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"If the array contains both positive and negative numbers, it's important to consider that multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive number. The maximum product could be formed by multiplying a sequence of negative numbers. We need to keep track of the minimum and maximum product ending at each index.\",\n    \"If the array contains a zero, the product of any subarray containing that zero will be zero.  We need to consider that a subarray containing a zero could potentially reset the current product, possibly leading to a new maximum product in another part of the array. A zero element effectively divides the array into subproblems.\",\n    \"If multiple subarrays have the same maximum product, the problem specifies that you should select the subarray with the greatest starting index. If those are the same, the correct subarray should have the greatest ending index. Therefore, during the traversal, we will check if we find the same maximum and update the selected subarray indexes by checking these conditions in the specified order.\",\n    \"The time complexity of the brute force approach is O(n^2) because we iterate through all possible subarrays. This can be inefficient for large arrays (up to 10^5), leading to a 'Time Limit Exceeded' error. We might be able to optimize it if we keep track of the positive and negative numbers.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
