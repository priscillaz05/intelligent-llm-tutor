Given X and Y, we need to find pairs (a, b) such that X/a + Y/b = 1.\\n- Algebraic Manipulation: Rearrange the equation to isolate one of the variables. For instance, Y/b = 1 - X/a, which simplifies to Y/b = (a - X) / a, and then b = (Ya) / (a - X).  Since b must be a positive integer, Ya must be divisible by (a - X) and (a - X) must be positive, implying a > X. Also, b must be positive so Ya/(a-X) > 0. Since Y and a are both positive, this means a - X > 0, so a > X.\\n- Transformation: Rewrite the expression for `b` in a more manageable form: `b = (Ya) / (a - X) = (Y(a - X) + YX) / (a - X) = Y + (YX) / (a - X)`. This implies that `(a - X)` must be a divisor of `YX`. The problem then reduces to finding the number of divisors of `YX` that are greater than 0, as `a = (YX) / divisor + X` needs to be solved for positive integers.\\n- Algorithmic Approach: Calculate the product `YX`. Then, iterate through the divisors of `YX`. Count the number of divisors `d` such that `a = X + d` results in integer `b`, i.e. b = Y + YX / d is also an integer.\\n- Optimizations: Instead of iterating up to YX, iterate up to the square root of YX, which improves efficiency, especially considering the large constraint values. Handle the cases where YX is a perfect square.\\n- Special Cases and Edge Conditions: Since we need integer intercepts, ensure that b is also an integer and positive.

We only need to iterate to the square root to find all divisors; and if YX is a perfect square, we must include the square root as well.\",\n    \"a > X, and a must be of the form a = d + X where d is a divisor of YX.
