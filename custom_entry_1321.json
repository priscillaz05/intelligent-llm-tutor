The rows are numbered from $1$ to $n$, the columns are numbered from $1$ to $m$.\\n\\nSeveral operations were performed on the picture (possibly, zero), each of one of the two kinds:\\n\\nchoose a cell such that it's not on the border (neither row $1$ or $n$, nor column $1$ or $m$) and it's surrounded by four cells of the opposite color (four zeros if it's a one and vice versa) and paint it the opposite color itself;\\n\\nmake a copy of the current picture.\\n\\nNote that the order of operations could be arbitrary, they were not necessarily alternating.\\n\\nYou are presented with the outcome: all $k$ copies that were made. Additionally, you are given the initial picture. However, all $k+1$ pictures are shuffled.\\n\\nRestore the sequence of the operations. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. The tests are constructed from the real sequence of operations, i. e. at least one answer always exists.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains three integers $n, m$ and $k$ ($3 \\\\le n, m \\\\le 30$; $0 \\\\le k \\\\le 100$) \u2014 the number of rows and columns of the pictures and the number of copies made, respectively.\\n\\nThen $k+1$ pictures follow \u2014 $k$ copies and the initial picture. Their order is arbitrary.\\n\\nEach picture consists of $n$ lines, each consisting of $m$ characters, each character is either $0$ or $1$. There is an empty line before each picture.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nIn the first line, print a single integer \u2014 the index of the initial picture. The pictures are numbered from $1$ to $k+1$ in the order they appear in the input.\\n\\nIn the second line, print a single integer $q$ \u2014 the number of operations.\\n\\nEach of the next $q$ lines should contain an operation. The operations should be listed in order they were applied. Each operation is one of two types:\\n\\n$1$ $x$ $y$ \u2014 recolor a cell $(x, y)$ (the $y$-th cell in the $x$-th row, it should not be on the border and it should be surrounded by four cells of opposite color to itself);\\n\\n$2$ $i$ \u2014 make a copy of the current picture and assign it index $i$ (picture with index the $i$ should be equal to the current picture).\\n\\nEach index from $1$ to $k+1$ should appear in the output exactly once \u2014 one of them is the index of the initial picture, the remaining $k$ are arguments of the operations of the second kind.\\n\\nIf there are multiple answers, print any of them.

These operations consist of flipping a cell surrounded by opposite colored cells and creating copies of the picture. The task is to restore the sequence of these operations given the initial picture and the copies, which are shuffled.\\n- Identifying the Initial State: Determine a method to identify which of the provided pictures is the initial picture. A possible method could be to analyze the number of surrounded cells that can be flipped (holes) and assuming the initial state has the most such locations.\\n- Formulating the Solution Strategy: Create a sequence of operations to transform the initial picture into the other pictures. These operations involve flipping specific cells and making copies, ensuring to match the final given picture states.\\n- Handling Multiple Solutions: Acknowledge that there might be multiple valid solutions and any of them can be printed.\\n- Algorithm to Identify Operations: Compare picture states to determine necessary flip operations. Store these along with copy operations.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can the initial picture be identified from the shuffled set of pictures?\",\n    \"What method can be used to compare two pictures and determine the operations needed to transform one into the other?\",\n    \"How do you represent the operations and ensure they are executed in the correct order?\",\n    \"How do you handle edge cases where there might be multiple valid sequences of operations?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The initial picture can be identified by analyzing the number of potentially flippable cells (holes). The picture with the highest number of holes is likely to be the initial state.\",\n    \"By iterating through the cells of two pictures and identifying the differences. Each difference corresponds to a flip operation that needs to be performed.\",\n    \"Operations can be represented as tuples: (1, x, y) for flip operations and (2, i) for copy operations. The order is determined by transforming the initial state to each given final state one by one.\",\n    \"Since any valid solution is acceptable, choosing the shortest sequence of operations or the one that follows the order of picture generation could be considered. There is no specific requirement to find all possible solutions.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
