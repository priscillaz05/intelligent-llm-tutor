A falling path must choose one element from each row such that no two elements chosen in adjacent rows are in the same column.\\n- Identifying Constraints: The key constraint is that elements in adjacent rows cannot be in the same column. This prevents a simple minimum path sum as in standard DP problems.\\n- Choosing an Algorithm: Dynamic programming is a suitable approach. We can build up the solution row by row, considering the constraint of non-zero shifts. For each cell, we need to add the minimum value from the previous row, excluding the cell directly above it.\\n- Optimizing Space: Instead of creating a separate DP table, the problem can be solved by modifying the input array in-place to store intermediate minimum sums for each row.\\n- Edge Case Handling: Consider cases with small grid sizes (e.g., a 1x1 grid). Ensure that the initialization handles the base cases correctly.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does \\\"falling path with non-zero shifts\\\" mean in the context of the problem, and how does it constrain the selection of elements?\",\n    \"Given the constraint that elements in adjacent rows cannot be in the same column, how can you formulate the dynamic programming state transition?\",\n    \"Can you outline the steps to modify the array in-place to store the minimum falling path sums up to each cell?\",\n    \"How do you handle the edge case where the grid is small (e.g., a 1x1 grid), or when certain rows might have duplicate minimum values?\",\n    \"In the in-place modification approach, what are the space complexity implications, and how does it compare to using an explicit DP table?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A \\\"falling path with non-zero shifts\\\" means selecting one element from each row such that the column index of each selected element is different from the column index of the element selected in the previous row. This prevents selecting elements in the same column in adjacent rows.\",\n    \"For each cell (i, j), the minimum falling path sum would be the value of arr[i][j] plus the minimum falling path sum from the previous row (i-1), excluding the element directly above it (i-1, j).  You essentially want min(arr[i-1][k]) for all k != j.\",\n    \"Iterate through the rows starting from the second row. For each cell (i, j), find the minimum value in the previous row excluding the element at column j. Add this minimum value to arr[i][j].

If there are duplicate minimum values, you need to consider the second smallest number, ensuring the column is different.\",\n    \"The in-place modification approach has a space complexity of O(1) (excluding the input array itself), as it does not use any additional data structures proportional to the input size. This is more space-efficient than using an explicit DP table, which would have a space complexity of O(n), where n is the width/height of the square grid.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
