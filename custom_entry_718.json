The modulo operator is essential to handle rotations larger than the number of columns.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: Create a new matrix to store the rotated elements. Iterate through each element of the original matrix, calculate its new column index using the modulo operator, and place the element into the new matrix at the calculated index.\\n- Implementation Details: Ensure the new matrix is initialized with the correct dimensions. Iterate through the rows and columns of the input matrix and place the elements in the correct positions in the new matrix.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean to 'left rotate' a matrix, specifically each row?\",\n    \"What is the most efficient way to calculate the new column index after rotating each element K positions to the left?\",\n    \"How do you deal with K being larger than the number of columns (M) in the matrix?\",\n    \"What is the purpose of the modulo operator in this context, and how does it simplify the calculation of the new column index?\",\n    \"What would be the time and space complexity of the proposed solution?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Left rotating a matrix means shifting each element in each row K positions to the left. Elements that are shifted off the left edge of the row wrap around to the right edge.\",\n    \"The most efficient way is to use the formula `(col - K) % num_cols`, where `col` is the original column index, `K` is the number of rotations, and `num_cols` is the number of columns in the matrix.\",\n    \"If K is larger than the number of columns, we can take K modulo the number of columns. This is because rotating by a number of times equivalent to the number of columns brings the matrix back to its original configuration. Therefore, only the remainder matters.\",\n    \"The modulo operator ensures that the new column index stays within the bounds of the matrix (0 to M-1). It handles the wrap-around effect when elements are shifted off the left edge.  `col - K` can be negative; the modulo operator handles this by wrapping around from the end.\",\n    \"The time complexity is O(N*M) because we iterate through each element of the matrix once. The space complexity is O(N*M) because we create a new matrix of the same dimensions as the input.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
