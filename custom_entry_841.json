Sounds easy, doesn't it?\\n\\nWell Here's the Twist. The inputs will gradually decrease with their index as parameter to the function.\\n\\n```python\\n  add(3,4,6) #returns (3/1)+(4/2)+(6/3)=7\\n```\\n\\nRemember the function will return 0 if no arguments are passed and it must round the result if sum is a float.\\n\\nExample\\n```python\\n  add() #=> 0\\n  add(1,2,3) #=> 3\\n  add(1,4,-6,20) #=> 6\\n```\\n\\nCheck my another kata here!! http://www.codewars.com/kata/555b73a81a6285b6ce000047\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def add(*args):\\n\\treturn int(round(sum((float(a) / i for (i, a) in enumerate(args, 1)))))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The task is to write a function `add` that takes a variable number of arguments and returns their sum, but each argument is divided by its index (starting from 1) before being added. The final result must be rounded to the nearest integer.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: When no arguments are passed, the function should return 0. The result of the sum should be rounded, meaning that a float result should be converted to an integer.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Use `*args` to handle a variable number of arguments. Use `enumerate` to pair each argument with its index, starting from 1. Use a generator expression to calculate the division for each argument. Use `sum` to add the results. Use `round` to round the result to the nearest integer and `int` to convert to an integer type.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Ensure correct indexing and handling of floating-point division. Use `float(a)` to ensure float division occurs if integers are passed as arguments.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you handle a variable number of arguments passed to a function in Python?\",\n    \"How can you associate each argument with its index in a function with variable arguments?\",\n    \"How do you ensure that the division is performed as floating-point division even when integer arguments are provided?\",\n    \"How do you round a floating-point number to the nearest integer in Python?\",\n    \"What is the expected return value when no arguments are passed to the `add` function?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"You can use `*args` in the function definition to collect all positional arguments into a tuple.\",\n    \"You can use the `enumerate` function with a starting index of 1 to iterate through the arguments and get their corresponding indices.\",\n    \"You can cast the numerator to a float using `float(a)` to ensure that the division results in a floating-point number.\",\n    \"You can use the `round` function to round the floating-point number to the nearest integer and then cast to integer using `int()`.\",\n    \"The function should return 0 when no arguments are passed.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
