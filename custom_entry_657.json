To be a good programmer you not only need to solve a problem, but also need to solve it as quickly as possible. \\n\\nYou are participating in this \\\"Week02 Contest\\\" and want to win it. You are sure that you will be able to solve all the questions in this contest, but to become Rank 1, you need to solve every problem in least amount of time with least number of wrong attempts.\\n\\nThe person solving maximum # of problems with least amount of time penalty wins the contest.So before solving any harder problem in the contest, you want to be prepared with a program which calculates time penalty for you. \\n\\nYou know that you start the contest at exactly 1/7/14 00:00 and end the contest at D/7/14 HH:MM with W #number of wrong attempts. [One wrong attempt adds 20 minutes to your time penalty] \\n\\nYou have to output the final time penalty.\\n\\nNote: For simplicity we assume we have only one problem to solve during the contest\\n\\nINPUT FORMAT:\\n\\nLine 1: 4 Integers D H M W\\n\\nCONSTRAINTS:\\n\\n1 \u2264 D \u2264 5\\n\\n0 \u2264 H \u2264 23\\n\\n0 \u2264 M \u2264 59\\n\\n0 \u2264 W \u2264 10^8\\n\\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\\n\\nLine 1: Time Penalty in Minutes\\n\\nSAMPLE INPUT\\n5 0 0 100000000\\n\\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\\n2000005760\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"D,H,M,W=input().split()\\nD,H,M,W=int(D),int(H),int(M),int(W)\\n\\nif __name__=='__main__':\\n\\tprint((D-1)*24*60+(20*W)+(H*60)+M)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem asks us to calculate the total time penalty given the day (D), hour (H), minute (M) of submission and the number of wrong attempts (W). The contest starts on day 1, so the time elapsed is (D-1) days, H hours, and M minutes.\\n- Identifying Key Factors: Each wrong attempt adds 20 minutes to the time penalty. The total time penalty is the sum of the time elapsed since the start of the contest and the penalty from wrong attempts.\\n- Selecting Calculation Strategy: Convert the days and hours to minutes.  Add the minutes, and finally add the penalty from wrong attempts (20 * W).\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you calculate the number of minutes elapsed from the start of the contest to the submission time?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the total penalty added by the wrong attempts?\",\n    \"What is the formula to calculate the final time penalty, combining the time elapsed and the penalty for wrong attempts?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Minutes elapsed = (D - 1) * 24 * 60 + H * 60 + M.\",\n    \"Penalty from wrong attempts = W * 20.\",\n    \"Final time penalty = (D - 1) * 24 * 60 + H * 60 + M + W * 20.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
