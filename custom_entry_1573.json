Chef wants to prepare a delicious cake for Gordon to impress him, but he does not know that Gordon Ramsay is not easy to impress.\\n\\nGordon cut Chef's cake into $N$ small slices (numbered $1$ through $N$), placed in a row in such a way that for each valid $i$, slices $i$ and $i+1$ are adjacent. Note that slices $N$ and $1$ are not adjacent. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th slice has *taste* $A_{i}$. Gordon wants to put special toppings on some slices and then ask Chef to group all slices into $K$ clusters in such a way that the slices in each cluster form a contiguous sequence and the *sweetness* of the cake is maximum possible.\\n\\nFor each valid $i$, let's denote the topping on the $i$-th slice by $t_{i}$ ($t_{i} = 0$ if there is no topping on this slice); the *sweetness* of this slice is $t_{i} \\\\cdot A_{i}$, so the sweetness of a slice without any special topping is $0$.\\n\\nThe sweetness of a cluster is the total (summed up) sweetness of all slices in this cluster. Let's denote the sweetnesses of all clusters by $S_{1}, S_{2}, \\\\ldots, S_{K}$. The sweetness of the whole cake is computed as $S_{1} * S_{2} * \\\\ldots * S_{K}$, where the operation $*$ is defined in the following way: for any non-negative integers $x$ and $y$ such that $x \\\\geq y$,\\n$$x * y = y * x = \\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\lfloor\\\\log_{2}(x)\\\\rfloor} 2^{n}(\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\\\rfloor \\\\bmod 2)(\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{y}{2^{n}}\\\\rfloor \\\\bmod 2) \\,.$$\\nIt can be proven that this operation is associative, i.e. $(x * y) * z = x * (y * z)$.\\n\\nYou should answer $Q$ queries. In each query, you are given the toppings on all slices and the number of clusters $K$.

Clusters must be contiguous. Need to handle multiple queries.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Use dynamic programming to find the maximum sweetness. The bitwise operation requires extracting bit patterns, which are most efficiently handled using bit manipulation.\\n- Implementation Details: Use prefix sums to efficiently compute cluster sweetnesses.
