Everyone decides to give them a punishment.\\nThey are going to be made to paint all the rooms of the ground floor of the hostel. \\n\\nThere are a total of N rooms on the ground floor arranged in a single row side by side numbered from 1 to N. HELL has to paint all the rooms with room numbers 1 to K (both inclusive) and Printf{} has to paint all the rooms with room numbers K+1 to N (both inclusive).\\n\\nBoth are given a total of 10 paints of distinct colours, 1 of them being White colour. They have to paint all the rooms such that atleast one of the rooms painted by each one of them is not White in colour so that the hostel ground floor has a minimum of two colourful (non-White) rooms. \\n\\nGiven N and K, you have to report the total number of different possible appearances of the hostel ground floor ie. , total number of different ways in which all the rooms of the ground floor can be painted. Assume that there is infinite amount of paint of each colour made available to both of them.\\n\\nInput :\\n\\nThe first line comprises of T denoting the number of test cases.

HELL paints rooms 1 to K, and Printf{} paints rooms K+1 to N.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints: Recognize that there are 10 colors available, one of which is white. Both HELL and Printf{} must paint at least one room a non-white color.\\n- Calculating Total Combinations: Calculate the total possible ways to paint the rooms without any restrictions. Then, subtract the cases where either HELL or Printf{} (or both) paint all their rooms white.\\n- Deriving the Formula: The total number of ways to paint the rooms is 10^N. The number of ways HELL paints all rooms white is 1^K, and the number of ways Printf{} paints all rooms white is 1^(N-K). Cases where both paint white rooms are equal to one.\\n- Simplify the expression: Total painting possibilities equal: 10^K * 10^(N-K) - 10^K - 10^(N-K) + 1, where each sub-expression represents the scenarios as specified above.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does 'at least one of the rooms painted by each one of them is not White' mean in terms of combinations to exclude?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the total number of ways to paint all rooms without any restrictions?\",\n    \"If HELL paints all rooms white and Printf{} also paints all rooms white, how should this overlap be handled?\",\n    \"Can you explain the mathematical reasoning behind subtracting the cases where all rooms are painted white by each person?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"It means that you should exclude cases where HELL paints rooms 1 to K entirely white, and also exclude the cases where Printf{} paints rooms K+1 to N entirely white.\",\n    \"Each room has 10 choices of color, so for N rooms, it's 10^N. However, because the groups painted by HELL and Printf are distinct, we can use 10^K * 10^(N-K)\",\n    \"When both HELL and Printf{} paint all their respective rooms white, this scenario has been subtracted twice, so it must be added back once using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\",\n    \"We subtract the cases where either HELL or Printf{} paints all their rooms white. By the principle of inclusion-exclusion, if both HELL and Printf{} independently paint rooms white, this configuration has been subtracted twice and therefore need to add it back once, which it equals to one since there's only one way that both can paint all their respective rooms white.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
