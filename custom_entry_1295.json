It takes A_i minutes to eat the i-th dish, whose deliciousness is B_i.\\nThe restaurant has the following rules:\\n - You can only order one dish at a time. The dish ordered will be immediately served and ready to eat.\\n - You cannot order the same kind of dish more than once.\\n - Until you finish eating the dish already served, you cannot order a new dish.\\n - After T-0.5 minutes from the first order, you can no longer place a new order, but you can continue eating the dish already served.\\nLet Takahashi's happiness be the sum of the deliciousness of the dishes he eats in this restaurant.\\nWhat is the maximum possible happiness achieved by making optimal choices?\\n\\n-----Constraints-----\\n - 2 \\\\leq N \\\\leq 3000\\n - 1 \\\\leq T \\\\leq 3000\\n - 1 \\\\leq A_i \\\\leq 3000\\n - 1 \\\\leq B_i \\\\leq 3000\\n - All values in input are integers.\\n\\n-----Input-----\\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\\nN T\\nA_1 B_1\\n:\\nA_N B_N\\n\\n-----Output-----\\nPrint the maximum possible happiness Takahashi can achieve.\\n\\n-----Sample Input-----\\n2 60\\n10 10\\n100 100\\n\\n-----Sample Output-----\\n110\\n\\nBy ordering the first and second dishes in this order, Takahashi's happiness will be 110.\\nNote that, if we manage to order a dish in time, we can spend any amount of time to eat it.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import sys\\nimport numpy as np\\ninput = sys.stdin.readline\\n(n, t) = map(int, input().split())\\nab = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]\\nab.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))\\ndp = np.array([0] * t)\\nans = 0\\nfor (a, b) in ab:\\n\\tans = max(ans, dp[-1] + b)\\n\\tdp[a:] = np.maximum(dp[:-a] + b, dp[a:])\\nprint(max(ans, dp[-1]))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem is a variation of the knapsack problem where you want to maximize happiness (total deliciousness) within a time constraint (T). You cannot order the same dish twice, and the time to order ends slightly before T.\\n- Identifying Core Constraints: Recognize that you can't order more dishes after T-0.5. Note that you can keep eating a dish that has already been served, even if the total time exceeds T.\\n- Algorithm Selection and Design: Consider using dynamic programming (DP) to keep track of the maximum happiness achievable at each time step. The DP array will represent happiness, indexed by time. Iterate through each dish and update the DP array based on whether including the dish increases happiness within the time limit.\\n- Implementation Details: Initialize the DP array. Sort the dishes by time taken. For each dish, iterate through the DP array, and if you can include the dish (time left >= time to eat), update the DP array with the new maximum happiness (happiness at time left - time to eat + deliciousness of the dish). Also consider the case of adding a dish at the end and just eating it.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Can you explain the relationship between the time limit T and the time required to eat a dish, and how it impacts the selection strategy?\",\n    \"How does the fact that you can continue eating a dish even after the ordering time limit is reached affect the optimal solution?\",\n    \"What dynamic programming approach would be suitable for this problem, and what would the DP state represent?\",\n    \"How would you handle the constraint that each dish can only be ordered once?\",\n    \"How would you initialize the DP table, and how would you iterate through the dishes to update the DP values efficiently?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The time limit T-0.5 means you cannot initiate a new order after that time. Therefore, the sum of the times of the chosen dishes must be less than or equal to T. You need to strategically choose dishes such that you maximize the total deliciousness without exceeding this combined time limit.\",\n    \"The fact that you can continue eating after the ordering time means if you order a dish just before T-0.5, you get the full deliciousness. This suggests a greedy-like approach near the end or considering the most delicious dishes that barely fit within the time limit.\",\n    \"A suitable DP approach would be to create a DP array dp[t] that represents the maximum happiness achievable at time t. This is a 1D knapsack type problem where the knapsack capacity is the time T.\",\n    \"Since each dish can only be ordered once, we can iterate through the dishes only once in the outer loop and decide whether to include it or not for each time step.\",\n    \"The DP table should be initialized with 0s, representing that no happiness is achieved if no dishes are eaten. Iterate through each dish. For each dish (a, b), iterate through the dp table in reverse order from T-1 down to a. If dp[t-a] + b > dp[t], then update dp[t] = dp[t-a] + b.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
