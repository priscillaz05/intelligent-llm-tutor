He is now investigating the case of vandalism at the exhibition of contemporary art.\\n\\nThe main exhibit is a construction of n matryoshka dolls that can be nested one into another. The matryoshka dolls are numbered from 1 to n. A matryoshka with a smaller number can be nested in a matryoshka with a higher number, two matryoshkas can not be directly nested in the same doll, but there may be chain nestings, for example, 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 4 \u2192 5. \\n\\nIn one second, you can perform one of the two following operations:  Having a matryoshka a that isn't nested in any other matryoshka and a matryoshka b, such that b doesn't contain any other matryoshka and is not nested in any other matryoshka, you may put a in b;  Having a matryoshka a directly contained in matryoshka b, such that b is not nested in any other matryoshka, you may get a out of b. \\n\\nAccording to the modern aesthetic norms the matryoshka dolls on display were assembled in a specific configuration, i.e. as several separate chains of nested matryoshkas, but the criminal, following the mysterious plan, took out all the dolls and assembled them into a single large chain (1 \u2192 2 \u2192 ... \u2192 n). In order to continue the investigation Andrewid needs to know in what minimum time it is possible to perform this action.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains integers n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of matryoshkas and matryoshka chains in the initial configuration.\\n\\nThe next k lines contain the descriptions of the chains: the i-th line first contains number m_{i} (1 \u2264 m_{i} \u2264 n), and then m_{i} numbers a_{i}1, a_{i}2, ..., a_{im}_{i} \u2014 the numbers of matryoshkas in the chain (matryoshka a_{i}1 is nested into matryoshka a_{i}2, that is nested into matryoshka a_{i}3, and so on till the matryoshka a_{im}_{i} that isn't nested into any other matryoshka).\\n\\nIt is guaranteed that m_1 + m_2 + ... + m_{k} = n, the numbers of matryoshkas in all the chains are distinct, in each chain the numbers of matryoshkas follow in the ascending order.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nIn the single line print the minimum number of seconds needed to assemble one large chain from the initial configuration.\\n\\n\\n-----Examples-----\\nInput\\n3 2\\n2 1 2\\n1 3\\n\\nOutput\\n1\\n\\nInput\\n7 3\\n3 1 3 7\\n2 2 5\\n2 4 6\\n\\nOutput\\n10\\n\\n\\n-----Note-----\\n\\nIn the first sample test there are two chains: 1 \u2192 2 and 3. In one second you can nest the first chain into the second one and get 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 3.\\n\\nIn the second sample test you need to disassemble all the three chains into individual matryoshkas in 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 seconds and then assemble one big chain in 6 seconds.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"(n, k) = map(int, input().split())\\np = [0 for i in range(n + 1)]\\nd = p.copy()\\nfor i in range(k):\\n\\ta = list(map(int, input().split()))\\n\\tl = len(a)\\n\\tfor j in range(1, l - 1):\\n\\t\\tp[a[j]] = a[j + 1]\\n\\t\\td[a[j + 1]] = 1\\nc = 1\\nwhile p[c] == c + 1:\\n\\tc = p[c]\\nans = 0\\nfor i in range(c + 1, n + 1):\\n\\tans += 1 + d[i]\\nprint(ans)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires finding the minimum time to convert k chains of nested matryoshka dolls into a single chain (1 -> 2 -> ... -> n). Each nesting or un-nesting operation takes 1 second.\\n- Identifying Key Operations: We need to determine which chains need to be disassembled and reassembled. The initial portion of the target chain (1 -> 2 -> ... -> c) may already exist in the initial configuration.\\n- Defining the Cost: The cost is calculated as the number of disassembly operations plus the number of assembly operations required to form the complete chain from 1 to n.\\n- Finding the Existing Chain: Determine the length of the existing chain starting from 1 (1 -> 2 -> ... -> c) that is already correctly nested.\\n- Calculating Disassembly Cost: For each of the remaining chains (excluding the existing one), count the number of matryoshkas minus 1 to determine how many disassembly operations are required. Then sum up these operations for all chains.\\n- Calculating Assembly Cost: The assembly cost can be calculated based on remaining dolls after removing the initial chain from 1 to c.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do we determine the length of the initial chain (1 -> 2 -> ... -> c) that is already correctly nested?\",\n    \"How do we calculate the number of disassembly operations needed for the remaining chains?\",\n    \"How many assembly operations are required to form the final chain (1 -> 2 -> ... -> n)?\",\n    \"How do we combine the costs of disassembly and assembly operations to determine the minimum time?\",\n    \"What data structures can be used to efficiently represent and manipulate the nested chains?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"We can iterate from matryoshka 1, checking if each matryoshka 'i' is nested in matryoshka 'i+1'.  We continue until we find a matryoshka that is not nested in the next one. The number of correctly nested matryoshkas is 'c'.\",\n    \"For each chain, the number of disassembly operations is the number of matryoshkas in the chain minus 1.  We sum up the disassembly operations required for all the chains that are not part of the initial chain 1 -> 2 -> ... -> c.\",\n    \"The assembly operations will be equal to n - c - number of chains that has been fully disassembled i.e all nodes from these chains has to be used to make chain from 1 to n. It is equivalent to number of nodes from all other chains that do not start from node 1 and number of nodes from the other chains after those chains have been disassembled.\",\n    \"The minimum time is the sum of the disassembly costs and the assembly costs.\",\n    \"A parent array 'p' can be used to represent the nested relationships, where p[i] stores the matryoshka that contains matryoshka i.  A boolean array 'd' can be used to indicate whether each matryoshka is nested in another.  A loop will be use to make sure elements are assembled and diassembled accordingly.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
