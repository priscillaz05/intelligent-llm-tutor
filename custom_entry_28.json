First, he thinks of some set of circles on a plane, and then tries to choose a beautiful set of points, such that there is at least one point from the set inside or on the border of each of the imagined circles.\\n\\nYesterday Ruslan tried to solve this problem for the case when the set of points is considered beautiful if it is given as (xt = f(t), yt = g(t)), where argument t takes all integer values from 0 to 50. Moreover, f(t) and g(t) should be correct functions.\\n\\nAssume that w(t) and h(t) are some correct functions, and c is an integer ranging from 0 to 50. The function s(t) is correct if it's obtained by one of the following rules: \\n\\n  1. s(t) = abs(w(t)), where abs(x) means taking the absolute value of a number x, i.e. |x|;\\n  2. s(t) = (w(t) + h(t));\\n  3. s(t) = (w(t) - h(t));\\n  4. s(t) = (w(t) * h(t)), where  *  means multiplication, i.e. (w(t)\u00b7h(t));\\n  5. s(t) = c;\\n  6. s(t) = t;\\n\\n\\n\\nYesterday Ruslan thought on and on, but he could not cope with the task. Now he asks you to write a program that computes the appropriate f(t) and g(t) for any set of at most 50 circles.\\n\\nIn each of the functions f(t) and g(t) you are allowed to use no more than 50 multiplications. The length of any function should not exceed 100\u00b7n characters. The function should not contain spaces.\\n\\nRuslan can't keep big numbers in his memory, so you should choose f(t) and g(t), such that for all integer t from 0 to 50 value of f(t) and g(t) and all the intermediate calculations won't exceed 109 by their absolute value.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line of the input contains number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 50) \u2014 the number of circles Ruslan thinks of. Next follow n lines, each of them containing three integers xi, yi and ri (0 \u2264 xi, yi \u2264 50, 2 \u2264 ri \u2264 50) \u2014 the coordinates of the center and the raduis of the i-th circle.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nIn the first line print a correct function f(t). In the second line print a correct function g(t). The set of the points (xt = f(t), yt = g(t)) (0 \u2264 t \u2264 50) must satisfy the condition, that there is at least one point inside or on the border of each of the circles, Ruslan thinks of at the beginning.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nInput\\n\\n3\\n0 10 4\\n10 0 4\\n20 10 4\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nt \\nabs((t-10))\\n\\nNote\\n\\nCorrect functions:\\n\\n  1. 10\\n  2.

The functions must adhere to specific construction rules, limit the number of multiplications, stay within a character limit, and avoid exceeding the numerical limit of 10^9.\\n- Identifying a Suitable Strategy: A possible strategy involves iterating through the circles and, for each circle, finding a value of t that satisfies the condition. We can simplify the function generation by creating functions that generate points close to the center of each circle.\\n- Implementing Function Generation: Develop f(t) and g(t) using the allowed operations, ensuring the multiplication limit is adhered to and the magnitude of values stay within bounds. Consider a simple approach where f(t) can represent the x coordinate and g(t) represents the y coordinate for different values of t, and choosing these to be the coordinates of the circle centres when t corresponds to circle index.\\n- Validation and Testing: Ensure that f(t) and g(t) meet the required format. For each circle, loop through t from 0 to 50, verifying if any point (f(t), g(t)) is inside or on the boundary of the circle. Optimize if initial functions fail the constraint.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How can you create f(t) and g(t) functions such that they generate points close to the center of each circle for some t?\",\n    \"How can we ensure the number of multiplications in both f(t) and g(t) do not exceed 50?\",\n    \"What is the approach to ensure that the values of f(t) and g(t) and all the intermediate calculations are within the specified range of -10^9 to 10^9?\",\n    \"What approach can be used to reduce the number of multiplications to fit into the limit?\",\n    \"How can the complexity of f(t) and g(t) be controlled to adhere to the maximum character length limitation?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"One way is to design f(t) and g(t) such that f(i) approximates the x-coordinate and g(i) approximates the y-coordinate of the i-th circle, where i is the circle index, and t can range from 0 to 50.\",\n    \"Ensure each function uses minimal multiplication. For instance, avoid chained multiplication unless necessary. If it helps, look for alternative formulations with only addition, subtraction, and absolute values.\",\n    \"Carefully choose the constants and intermediate results to avoid large values during calculation. If multiplication is involved, ensure that the operands are reasonably small so the product does not exceed 10^9.\",\n    \"Where possible, try to use addition and subtraction over multiplication, as the problem doesn't limit the number of additions, only multiplications. Also, make heavy use of constants rather than t where possible.\",\n    \"Keep the structure of the function simple. Avoid deeply nested expressions, and reduce redundancies. For instance, if f(t) contains a sub-expression, try to reuse it in g(t) if logically possible to share the character length.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
