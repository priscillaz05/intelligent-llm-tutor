A number x is said to be Deficient Number if sum of all the divisors of the number denoted by divisorsSum(x) is less than twice the value of the number x. And the difference between these two values is called the deficiency.\\nMathematically, if below condition holds the number is said to be Deficient:\\ndivisorsSum(x) < 2*x\\ndeficiency = (2*x) - divisorsSum(x)\\nExample 1:\\nInput: x = 21\\nOutput: YES \\nExplanation: Divisors are 1, 3, 7 and\\n21.Sum of divisors is 32. \\nThis sum is less than 2*21 or 42.\\nExample 2:\\nInput: x = 12\\nOutput: NO\\nExplanation: Divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4,\\n6 and 12.Sum of divisors is 28.\\nThis sum is not less than 2*12 or 24.\\nYour Task:  \\nYou dont need to read input or print anything.

Instead, iterate up to the square root of x, and for each divisor found, account for both divisors (i and x/i).\\n- Handling Perfect Squares: Consider edge cases, such as perfect squares, where one divisor would be counted twice if simply adding i and x/i. Ensure these are handled correctly to avoid overcounting.\\n- Edge Cases and Constraint Considerations: Understand that the input constraint is 1 <= x <= 10000000, which influences the choice of data types and algorithms. No special handling for 1 is needed as the algorithm will correctly identify divisors.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does it mean for a number to be 'deficient,' and how is it mathematically defined?\",\n    \"How can you compute the sum of divisors of a number x efficiently, aiming for O(sqrt(x)) time complexity?\",\n    \"When calculating divisor pairs up to the square root of x, what specific case must you handle to avoid incorrect sums, and how do you handle it?\",\n    \"What edge cases should be considered when calculating the sum of divisors for the provided constraints, and how should they be handled?\",\n    \"Given the problem constraints, do you anticipate any potential memory issues or overflow issues when dealing with large input values?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A number is deficient if the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself) is less than the number itself.

If i is a divisor (x % i == 0), then i and x/i are both divisors. Add both to the sum.\",\n    \"When i * i equals x (i.e., x is a perfect square), i is counted as a divisor twice. Therefore, only add i to the sum once in this case.\",\n    \"The constraint 1 <= x <= 10000000 suggests that there is a need to consider the lower bound 1 and upper bound 10000000, but there is no special handling of 1 needed as the algorithm will correctly identify divisors.
