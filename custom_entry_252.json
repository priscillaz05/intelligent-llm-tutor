The substrings are defined by pairs of indices (i, j) where 1 <= i <= j <= |s|.\\n- Identifying the core task:  The core task is to iterate through all possible pairs of (i, j) and check if the substring s[i:j+1] contains 'bear'.\\n- Optimizing the search for \\\"bear\\\": Instead of repeatedly searching for \\\"bear\\\" in every substring, find each index where \u201cbear\u201d appears in the string, then for each of these indexes calculate the number of substrings which contain it, this leads to the formula (index - i + 1) * (n - index -3).\\n- Handling edge cases: consider empty string or no \\\"bear\\\" in the string.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you iterate through all possible substrings defined by indices i and j?\",\n    \"How do you check if a given substring contains the string \\\"bear\\\"?\",\n    \"Can you describe a more efficient approach than brute-force to solve this problem?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases for this problem, and how do you handle them?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the number of substrings which contain a certain \\\"bear\\\" starting index?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"You can iterate through all possible substrings by using nested loops. The outer loop iterates from i = 1 to |s|, and the inner loop iterates from j = i to |s|.\",\n    \"You can check if a substring contains \\\"bear\\\" by using the 'find' method or by iterating through the substring and checking for consecutive characters 'b', 'e', 'a', 'r'.\",\n    \"Instead of checking all substrings, find all indexes where the substring 'bear' starts.
