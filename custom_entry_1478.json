(You may search for it and complete it if you have not done it)\\n\\n\\nIn this kata, we have an unsorted sequence of consecutive numbers from  ```a``` to ```b```, such that ```a < b``` always (remember ```a```, is the minimum, and ```b``` the maximum value).\\n\\nThey were introduced an unknown amount of duplicates in this sequence and we know that there is an only missing value such that all the duplicate values and the missing value are between ```a``` and ```b```, but never coincide with them.\\n\\nFind the missing number with the duplicate numbers (duplicates should be output in a sorted array).\\n\\nLet's see an example:\\n\\n```arr = [10,9,8,9,6,1,2,4,3,2,5,5,3]```\\n\\n```find_dups_miss([10,9,8,9,6,1,2,4,3,2,5,5,3]) == [7,[2,3,5,9]]```\\n\\nThe code should be fast to process long arrays (maximum length aprox. = 1.000.000).\\nThe values for the randon tests:\\n```\\n500 <= a <= 50000\\na + k <= b and 100 <= k <= 1000000\\namount of duplicates variable, according to the length of the array\\n```\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"from collections import Counter\\n\\ndef find_dups_miss(arr):\\n\\t(mi, ma, c) = (min(arr), max(arr), Counter(arr))\\n\\tduplicates = sorted((n for n in c if c[n] > 1))\\n\\treturn [ma * (ma + 1) // 2 - mi * (mi - 1) // 2 - sum(c), duplicates]\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires identifying a single missing number and all duplicate numbers within an unsorted sequence of consecutive numbers from `a` to `b`. The missing number and duplicates are guaranteed to be within the range (a, b) exclusive.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: An efficient way to find the missing number and duplicates is to use a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each number in the array. The duplicates can be identified by checking which numbers have a count greater than 1. The missing number can be found by calculating the expected sum of the numbers from `a` to `b` and subtracting the actual sum of the numbers in the array. The difference will give the missing number.\\n- Data Structures: A `Counter` from the `collections` module is used to efficiently count the occurrences of each number. A sorted list is used to store the duplicate numbers.\\n- Implementation Details: Find the minimum and maximum values in the array using `min` and `max` functions, respectively. Count the occurrences of each number using `Counter`. Iterate through the counter to find duplicates. Calculate the expected sum using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `n*(n+1)//2`. Calculate the difference between the expected sum and the actual sum to find the missing number.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you handle large arrays efficiently to avoid exceeding time limits?\",\n    \"What is the mathematical formula to calculate the sum of consecutive numbers from a to b?\",\n    \"How would you ensure that duplicates are stored in sorted order?\",\n    \"What edge cases should be considered when determining the minimum and maximum values in the array?\",\n    \"How does using a `Counter` help in optimizing the solution's performance?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Using a `Counter` to count occurrences allows for O(n) time complexity, which is more efficient than nested loops or sorting-based approaches for finding duplicates. Calculating the missing value by summing expected vs actual avoids needing to iterate over all possible numbers.\",\n    \"The sum of consecutive numbers from `a` to `b` can be calculated as `b*(b+1)//2 - (a-1)*a//2` or  `ma * (ma + 1) // 2 - mi * (mi - 1) // 2` where `ma` is maximum element and `mi` is minimum element in the input array.\",\n    \"The `sorted()` function can be used on the list of duplicates to ensure they are stored in ascending order.\",\n    \"If the input array is empty, you could return `None` or a predefined error message. In other cases, `min` and `max` built-in functions will work as expected even if the input has duplicate `min` or `max` values.\",\n    \"Using a `Counter` avoids nested loops, making the duplicate detection O(n) where n is the length of the array, drastically reducing computation time for larger arrays.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
