The remaining time needs to be calculated for both standard and triple recording modes and outputted in a specific format (HH:MM:SS), with leading zeros.\\n- Input Handling: The input consists of hours, minutes, and seconds (T, H, S). The input loop terminates when T, H, and S are all -1.  The provided time must be within the 120 minute (7200 second) limit.\\n- Calculation of Remaining Time: The remaining time in standard mode is calculated by subtracting the current time (in seconds) from the total tape length (120 minutes = 7200 seconds). The remaining time in triple mode is three times the remaining time in standard mode.\\n- Conversion to HH:MM:SS Format: Convert the remaining time (in seconds) into hours, minutes, and seconds.  Ensure the output includes leading zeros for values less than 10.\\n- Output Formatting: Output the calculated times in the specified HH:MM:SS format.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you convert hours, minutes, and seconds into total seconds?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the remaining time in standard recording mode given the total tape length and the current time?\",\n    \"How do you calculate the remaining time in triple recording mode?\",\n    \"How do you convert total seconds back into hours, minutes, and seconds?\",\n    \"How do you ensure the output format is always HH:MM:SS with leading zeros?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Multiply hours by 3600, minutes by 60, and add seconds:  total_seconds = hours * 3600 + minutes * 60 + seconds.\",\n    \"Subtract the current time in seconds from the total tape length (7200 seconds): remaining_time = 7200 - current_time.\",\n    \"Multiply the remaining time in standard mode by 3: remaining_time_triple = remaining_time * 3.\",\n    \"Hours = total_seconds // 3600.
