These sections are connected by a chain: the 1-st section is adjacent only to the 2-nd one, the 2-nd one \u2014 to the 1-st and the 3-rd ones, the 3-rd one \u2014 only to the 2-nd one. The transitions are possible only between the adjacent sections.\\n\\nThe spacecraft team consists of n aliens. Each of them is given a rank \u2014 an integer from 1 to n. The ranks of all astronauts are distinct. The rules established on the Saucer, state that an alien may move from section a to section b only if it is senior in rank to all aliens who are in the segments a and b (besides, the segments a and b are of course required to be adjacent). Any alien requires exactly 1 minute to make a move. Besides, safety regulations require that no more than one alien moved at the same minute along the ship.\\n\\nAlien A is senior in rank to alien B, if the number indicating rank A, is more than the corresponding number for B.\\n\\nAt the moment the whole saucer team is in the 3-rd segment. They all need to move to the 1-st segment. One member of the crew, the alien with the identification number CFR-140, decided to calculate the minimum time (in minutes) they will need to perform this task.\\n\\nHelp CFR-140, figure out the minimum time (in minutes) that all the astronauts will need to move from the 3-rd segment to the 1-st one. Since this number can be rather large, count it modulo m.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers: n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 109) \u2014 the number of aliens on the saucer and the number, modulo which you should print the answer, correspondingly.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nPrint a single number \u2014 the answer to the problem modulo m.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nInput\\n\\n1 10\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\nInput\\n\\n3 8\\n\\n\\nOutput\\n\\n2\\n\\nNote\\n\\nIn the first sample the only crew member moves from segment 3 to segment 2, and then from segment 2 to segment 1 without any problems. Thus, the whole moving will take two minutes.\\n\\nTo briefly describe the movements in the second sample we will use value <image>, which would correspond to an alien with rank i moving from the segment in which it is at the moment, to the segment number j. Using these values, we will describe the movements between the segments in the second sample: <image>, <image>, <image>, <image>, <image>, <image>, <image>, <image>, <image>, <image>, <image>, <image>, <image>, <image>, <image>, <image>, <image>, <image>, <image>, <image>, <image>, <image>, <image>, <image>, <image>, <image>; In total: the aliens need 26 moves. The remainder after dividing 26 by 8 equals 2, so the answer to this test is 2.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"(n, m) = map(int, input().split())\\n\\ndef fast_power(base, exp):\\n\\tres = 1\\n\\twhile exp > 0:\\n\\t\\tif exp % 2 == 1:\\n\\t\\t\\tres = res * base % m\\n\\t\\tbase = base * base % m\\n\\t\\texp //= 2\\n\\treturn res\\nprint((fast_power(3, n) - 1 + m) % m)\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding Problem Requirements: Recognize that all 'n' aliens need to move from section 3 to section 1. They can only move to adjacent sections. The move is permitted only if the alien moving is senior to all aliens in both the source and destination sections.\\n- Identifying the Key Insight: The problem's core lies in determining the minimum number of moves. The key to this is understanding that each alien needs to move twice (3->2, 2->1). A deeper insight is needed to relate n to the total number of moves and expressing the answer efficiently, potentially using exponentiation.\\n- Choosing an Algorithmic Strategy: Since we need to calculate moves modulo m, and the number of aliens is n, and the aliens have to move between sections, we can derive a closed-form expression and use fast exponentiation to compute it efficiently. The total number of moves can be expressed as 3^n - 1. Then, this result can be taken modulo m.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Efficiently calculating 3^n modulo m is crucial, given that n can be up to 10^9. The use of fast exponentiation can improve the time complexity.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the constraints on alien movements between sections, and how do those constraints affect the solution approach?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently calculate the total number of moves required for 'n' aliens to move from section 3 to section 1, considering the modulo 'm'?\",\n    \"What mathematical approach would be best to compute the result without iterating through all aliens individually?\",\n    \"Given the constraints that n and m can be as large as 10^9, what are the time complexity concerns, and how can you optimize your algorithm to address them?\",\n    \"How does the ranking of the aliens affect the minimum number of moves?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Aliens can only move to adjacent sections and only if they are senior to all aliens in both sections. The ranking of the aliens imposes a hierarchy for movement. This implies a structured approach to solve this problem.\",\n    \"The total number of moves required can be derived as 3^n - 1, and then the modulo m needs to be computed.\",\n    \"A closed-form mathematical expression, specifically fast exponentiation is more efficient.\",\n    \"With n and m up to 10^9, direct iteration would be too slow. Fast exponentiation achieves the result in logarithmic time, which is efficient enough.\",\n    \"All aliens have to move, hence all ranks are involved. The ranking determines the move precedence but doesn't affect the total number of moves as all aliens must ultimately move from sector 3 to sector 1.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
