If function is called without arguments it should return false.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def only_one(*args):\\n\\treturn sum(args) == 1\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem Requirements: The function must accept any number of boolean arguments. It should return True if exactly one argument is True, and all others are False. If no arguments are provided, it should return False.\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: The function must correctly handle the case with no arguments. It needs to efficiently check for exactly one True value without iterating excessively.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Consider using the `sum()` function to count the number of True values, as True is treated as 1 and False as 0 in Python. Check if the sum is equal to 1.\\n- Implementation Considerations: Use `*args` to allow for any number of arguments. Use `sum(args)` as a concise way to count True values. Return False if no arguments are provided (the `args` tuple will be empty).\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the behavior of `sum()` when applied to a tuple of boolean values, and how does this help simplify the problem?\",\n    \"How should the function behave when no arguments are passed, and why is this case important to handle?\",\n    \"Can you explain how the function correctly identifies if exactly one argument is True while all others are False?\",\n    \"What are some alternative approaches to solving this problem, and what are their trade-offs compared to the `sum()` approach?\",\n    \"Are there any edge cases or specific input combinations that might cause unexpected behavior, and how can those be prevented?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The `sum()` function treats True as 1 and False as 0, so summing a tuple of boolean values effectively counts the number of True values. This simplifies the problem by allowing us to directly check if the sum is equal to 1.\",\n    \"The function should return False when no arguments are passed, as the problem specifies that the function should return False in that scenario. This case needs to be handled to meet the problem's requirements.\",\n    \"The function uses `sum(args) == 1` to check if exactly one argument is True. If the sum is 1, it means there's one True (represented as 1) and the rest are False (represented as 0).\",\n    \"Alternative approaches could involve iterating through the arguments and counting the True values, but the `sum()` approach is more concise and efficient. Another approach could involve using the XOR operation on the boolean values.\",\n    \"If non-boolean arguments are passed, they could lead to incorrect behavior with the sum function. One might explicitly check the types of the arguments to ensure that they are boolean values, or cast them to booleans.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
