If the second string is a rotated version of the first, the function should return the number of shifts. If not, it should return -1 (or nil in Swift).\\n- Validating Inputs: Check if the strings are of the same length. If they aren't, the second string cannot be a rotation of the first, so return -1 (or nil in Swift).\\n- Finding the Shift: Concatenate the second string with itself. Then, search for the first string within the concatenated string. If found, the index of the first string in the concatenated string is the number of shifts.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Consider cases where the strings are identical (shift of 0), or where the first string is not found in the doubled second string (invalid rotation).\\n- Returning the Result: Return the shift value if the first string is found within the doubled second string; otherwise, return -1 (or nil in Swift).\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the primary condition that must be met before determining the shift, and why is it crucial?\",\n    \"How does concatenating the second string with itself help in finding the shift?\",\n    \"If the first string is found within the doubled second string, what does the index of the first occurrence represent?\",\n    \"What should the function return if the lengths of the two strings are different?\",\n    \"What should be returned when the first string is not found in the concatenated second string?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The two strings must be of the same length. If they aren't, the second string cannot be a rotation of the first.\",\n    \"Concatenating the second string with itself creates all possible rotations of the second string, making it easier to check if the first string is a rotation of the second.\",\n    \"The index represents the number of shifts needed to rotate the first string to match the second string.\",\n    \"The function should return -1 (or nil in Swift) because the second string cannot be a rotation of the first string if the lengths differ.\",\n    \"The function should return -1 (or nil in Swift), as it indicates that the second string is not a valid rotation of the first.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
