"```json\n{\n  \"Coding Problem\": \"Chef recently saw the movie Matrix. He loved the movie overall but he didn't agree with some things in it. Particularly he didn't agree with the bald boy when he declared - There is no spoon. Being a chef, he understands the importance of the spoon and realizes that the universe can't survive without it. Furthermore, he is sure there is a spoon; he saw it in his kitchen this morning. So he has set out to prove the bald boy is wrong and find a spoon in the matrix. He has even obtained a digital map already. Can you help him?\\n\\nFormally you're given a matrix of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. Your job is to find out if the word \\\"Spoon\\\" occurs somewhere in the matrix or not. A word is said to be occurred in the matrix if it is presented in some row from left to right or in some column from top to bottom. Note that match performed has to be case insensitive. \\n\\n------ Input ------ \\n\\nThe first line of input contains a positive integer T, the number of test cases. After that T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers R and C, the number of rows and the number of columns of the matrix M respectively. Thereafter R lines follow each containing C characters, the actual digital map itself.\\n\\n------ Output ------ \\n\\nFor each test case print one line. If a \\\"Spoon\\\" is found in Matrix, output \\\"There is a spoon!\\\" else output \\\"There is indeed no spoon!\\\" (Quotes only for clarity).\\n\\n------ Constraints ------ \\n\\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\\n\\n1 \u2264 R, C \u2264 100\\n\\n----- Sample Input 1 ------ \\n3\\n3 6\\nabDefb\\nbSpoon\\nNIKHil\\n6 6\\naaaaaa\\nssssss\\nxuisdP\\noooooo\\nioowoo\\nbdylan\\n6 5\\nbdfhj\\ncacac\\nopqrs\\nddddd\\nindia\\nyucky\\n----- Sample Output 1 ------ \\nThere is a spoon!\\nThere is a spoon!\\nThere is indeed no spoon!\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"for i in range(int(input())):\\n\\t(n, m) = map(int, input().split())\\n\\tl = []\\n\\tfor i in range(n):\\n\\t\\tl.append(input().lower())\\n\\tf = 0\\n\\tfor i in l:\\n\\t\\tif 'spoon' in i:\\n\\t\\t\\tf = 1\\n\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\tif f == 0:\\n\\t\\tfor j in range(m):\\n\\t\\t\\tfor i in range(n - 4):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif l[i][j] == 's' and l[i + 1][j] == 'p' and (l[i + 2][j] == 'o') and (l[i + 3][j] == 'o') and (l[i + 4][j] == 'n'):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tf = 1\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbreak\\n\\tif f == 1:\\n\\t\\tprint('There is a spoon!')\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tprint('There is indeed no spoon!')\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The task is to search for the word \\\"Spoon\\\" (case-insensitive) in a given matrix, either row-wise or column-wise.\\n- Input Processing: Read the number of test cases, dimensions of the matrix (R and C), and the matrix itself.\\n- Case-Insensitive Search: Convert the input to lowercase to perform a case-insensitive search.\\n- Row-wise Search: Iterate through each row and check if \\\"spoon\\\" is a substring of the row.\\n- Column-wise Search: If no spoon is found in any row, iterate through each column and check if \\\"spoon\\\" can be formed vertically.\\n- Output: Print \\\"There is a spoon!\\\" if found, otherwise print \\\"There is indeed no spoon!\\\".\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the most efficient way to perform a case-insensitive search for a substring within a string?\",\n    \"How should the input matrix be stored to facilitate both row-wise and column-wise searching?\",\n    \"How can we optimize the column-wise search to avoid unnecessary iterations?\",\n    \"What are the edge cases or constraints that could affect the correctness or efficiency of the algorithm?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Converting both the string and the substring to lowercase is an efficient way to perform a case-insensitive search.\",\n    \"A list of strings where each string represents a row of the matrix allows for easy row-wise access. For column-wise access, we can iterate over the columns using indexing.\",\n    \"The column-wise search can be optimized by only checking if the characters form the word \\\"spoon\\\" starting from each possible position. The inner loop for checking the columns will break immediately if a spoon is found.\",\n    \"The code must handle empty rows and columns correctly and it should deal with cases where the matrix has either very few rows or very few columns. Also, an empty matrix needs to be considered as well. Also the search can short circuit as soon as a spoon is found either row wise or column wise.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
