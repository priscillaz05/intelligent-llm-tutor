Ross is punctual and gets ready on time.\\n\\nHowever, Joey and Chandler are behaving like children and fighting over everything. On getting a firm shouting from Ross, both of them decide to get dressed but they are still angry at each other. Chandler decides to have the final laugh by stealing Joey\u2019s underwear. This makes Joey mad and he decides to wear all the pants owned by Chandler. \\n\\nThis infuriates Ross even more. There is a time crunch and he wants Joey to wear pants of a single color.\\n\\nJoey has N pants. Given a string S of length N, where S_{i} represents the colour of i^{th} pant. Joey is allowed to make up to K moves. To make a move, Joey has to do the following:\\n \\nPick a prefix (possibly empty or complete), say P from the string S.\\nDiscard a suffix (possibly empty or complete) from P.\\nAdd P back to the string.\\n\\nFor example, Let the pants be denoted by the string S = AABAD. In one move Joey can, pick a prefix P = AABA, discard the suffix ABA from P and finally, add P = A back to the string S. The final string becomes AD. \\n\\nAfter making up to K moves, Joey decides to wear the pants denoted by the final string, if all of them are of the same colour.\\n\\nFind the maximum number of pants that Joey can wear such that all of them are of the same colour, after making at most K moves. If it is impossible to wear pants of the same colour even after K moves, print -1. \\n\\n------ Input Format ------ \\n\\n- First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\\n- For each testcase first line of input contains two integers N, K, the number of pants and the maximum number of moves.\\n- Second line of each testcase contains a string S consisting of uppercase english letters. i^{th} character from the beginning denotes the colour of the i^{th} layer of pants from top.\\n\\n------ Output Format ------ \\n\\nFor each testcase, output in a single line the maximum number of pants of the same colour that Joey can wear using atmost K moves.

Now the string $S$ is $AACA$. For the second move, Joey can pick the prefix with 3 pants i.e. $AAC$, discard the prefix $C$ and add remaining prefix $AA$ back to string.\\nFinally, the string looks like $AAA$, i.e. $3$ pants of colour $A$.\\n\\nTest case 2:  For the first and only move, Joey can pick the prefix $ABAB$, i.e. the entire string and discard the suffix $BAB$, and add the remaining prefix i.e. $A$ back to the string.\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"import heapq\\nt = int(input())\\n\\ndef f(arr, n, k, c):\\n\\tans = 0\\n\\ti = 0\\n\\twhile arr[i] == c and i < n:\\n\\t\\tans += 1\\n\\t\\ti += 1\\n\\tif i >= n:\\n\\t\\treturn n\\n\\tj = n - 1\\n\\twhile arr[j] == c:\\n\\t\\tans += 1\\n\\t\\tj -= 1\\n\\tif k == 0 and ans != n:\\n\\t\\treturn -1\\n\\tif k == 1:\\n\\t\\treturn ans\\n\\th = []\\n\\theapq.heapify(h)\\n\\tindex = i\\n\\ttemp = 0\\n\\tfor m in range(i, j + 1):\\n\\t\\tif arr[m] == c:\\n\\t\\t\\ttemp += 1\\n\\t\\telse:\\n\\t\\t\\tif temp > 0:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\theapq.heappush(h, -1 * temp)\\n\\t\\t\\ttemp = 0\\n\\twhile k > 1 and len(h) > 0:\\n\\t\\tans += -1 * heapq.heappop(h)\\n\\t\\tk -= 1\\n\\tif ans == 0:\\n\\t\\treturn -1\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\treturn ans\\nfor i in range(t):\\n\\t(n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().strip().split()]\\n\\tarr = input().strip()\\n\\tif arr == arr[0] * n:\\n\\t\\tprint(n)\\n\\t\\tcontinue\\n\\tif k == 0:\\n\\t\\tprint(-1)\\n\\t\\tcontinue\\n\\tprint(max([f(arr, n, k, chr(j)) for j in range(ord('A'), ord('Z') + 1)]))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The problem requires determining the maximum number of pants of the same color Joey can wear after at most K moves. A move consists of picking a prefix, discarding a suffix, and adding the remaining part of the prefix back to the string. If it is impossible to have all pants of the same color after K moves, return -1.\\n- Devising a Strategy: The key is to iterate through each possible color and check if it's possible to achieve the maximum length for that color. Optimizations include checking if all pants are of the same color initially and returning N if so. If K is 0, return -1 if the array has different colors.\\n- Optimizing Moves: With each move, a portion of the pants can be made into a single color. The strategy involves making segments of the same color, such that a large number of pants are of the same color, and with each operation joining smaller segments with existing pants of the same color present at the front or at the end.\\n- Edge Cases: Handling edge cases such as when the input string is already of one color, or when K is zero.\\n- Combining all ideas and implement the algorithm and account for edge cases.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the maximum possible number of pants Joey can wear, and how does this relate to the value that should be outputted if all pants are of the same color?\",\n    \"How can each 'move' influence the overall state of the string, and what does picking a prefix, discarding a suffix, and re-adding mean?\",\n    \"How does the value of K influence the solution, and how should the code handle cases where K is zero?\",\n    \"What data structure can be helpful in tracking the lengths of the segments after the first K moves?\",\n    \"What edge cases should you consider, and what would the expected output be in each of these cases?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"If all pants are of the same color, the maximum number of pants Joey can wear is N, and this value should be outputted directly.\",\n    \"A move changes the string by picking a prefix P, discarding a suffix from P to get a shorter prefix P', and appending P' to the beginning. This effectively replaces a portion of the original string with a new prefix.\",\n    \"K represents the maximum number of moves Joey can make. If K is zero and the array is not initially all of one color, the function should return -1, indicating it's impossible to achieve the desired configuration.\",\n    \"A heap can be useful. To keep track of segments that should be combined. The biggest gaps are chosen first.\",\n    \"Edge cases include when the input string is already of one color (output N), when K is zero (output -1 if not all of one color), and when the string is empty (output 0 or -1, depending on the problem's precise requirements).\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
