One of such dormitories has a a \u00d7 b square meter wonder room. The caretaker wants to accommodate exactly n students there. But the law says that there must be at least 6 square meters per student in a room (that is, the room for n students must have the area of at least 6n square meters). The caretaker can enlarge any (possibly both) side of the room by an arbitrary positive integer of meters. Help him change the room so as all n students could live in it and the total area of the room was as small as possible.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains three space-separated integers n, a and b (1 \u2264 n, a, b \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of students and the sizes of the room.\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nPrint three integers s, a_1 and b_1 (a \u2264 a_1;\u00a0b \u2264 b_1) \u2014 the final area of the room and its sizes.

The dimensions of the room, a and b, can be increased.\\n- Calculating Minimum Required Area: Calculate the minimum area required for n students (6 * n).\\n- Handling Existing Room Area: Check if the current room area (a * b) is already sufficient. If it is, the current dimensions are the solution.\\n- Finding Optimal Dimensions: If the current area is insufficient, determine how much each dimension needs to be increased such that the resultant area is minimal. This is approached by incrementing from the smaller of the initial dimensions, and calculating the other dimension by dividing the minimum required area.\\n- Ensuring Valid Output: Make sure that the resulting dimensions are greater than or equal to the original dimensions, and output in the required format.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the minimum required area for n students, and how do you calculate it?\",\n    \"If the initial area is already sufficient, what should the output be?\",\n    \"How can you find optimal dimensions when the initial area is insufficient?\",\n    \"What constraints must the new dimensions meet relative to the original dimensions?\",\n    \"How do you find the minimal area given the constraints?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The minimum required area is 6 * n, where n is the number of students.\",\n    \"If the initial area (a * b) is greater than or equal to 6 * n, the output should be a * b, a, b.\",\n    \"When the initial area is insufficient, try all possible values between min(a,b) and the ceiling of the square root of (6*n).
