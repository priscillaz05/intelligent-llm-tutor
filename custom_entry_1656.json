Given n passengers and the coordinates $b_i$ and $d_i$ for each of the $ith$ passenger at which they board and leave from the train respectively. Due to current COVID-19 crisis, the train is monitored at each mile/coordinate. The infection degree of the train at each mile is equal to the total passengers present in the train at that mile/coordinate. The train stops its journey if no more passengers are there to board the train. The term infection severity of the journey is defined as the sum of infection degrees noted at each mile. Find the Infection severity of the journey.

The infection degree at each mile is the number of passengers on the train at that mile. Passengers are counted at both boarding and departure miles. The answer needs to be modulo (10^9 + 7).\\n- Identifying Potential Pitfalls: The input range for boarding and departure coordinates is quite large (-500000 to 500000). The problem description specifies x travels from negative infinity, but the train only stops when there are no passengers to board, so we only need to consider the range of the given inputs. The large potential answer size requires using modulo arithmetic to prevent overflow.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Iterate through the input, accumulating the sum of |departure mile - boarding mile| + 1 for each passenger, and taking the modulo after the sum is computed.  We can efficiently compute the required sum directly from the input data without needing to simulate the train journey step by step.\\n- Implementing Modulo Arithmetic: Make sure the final result is taken modulo (10^9 + 7) to avoid integer overflow.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you determine the range of miles to consider for calculating infection severity?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: Determine the minimum boarding coordinate and the maximum departure coordinate from all passengers.  The infection severity sum needs to be calculated from the minimum boarding to the maximum departure coordinate (inclusive)\",\n    \"Why is it important to use modulo arithmetic, and when should it be applied?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: Modulo arithmetic is crucial to prevent integer overflow, since the infection severity can be very large. Modulo should be applied at the end of the computation or during intermediate summations, provided that it doesn't affect the correctness of the algorithm.\",\n    \"How would you calculate the number of passengers present at each mile between a passenger's boarding and departure points, inclusive?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: The number of miles between the boarding and departure points, inclusive, is abs(departure mile - boarding mile) + 1.\",\n    \"What are the edge cases or constraints you should consider while implementing the solution?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: The number of passengers can be 0, and the boarding and departure points can be negative or zero. The range of the boarding and departure points should also be considered.\",\n    \"Given that the calculation requires summing over a large range and applying modulo, how can you simplify the approach for efficiency?\",\n    \"Expected Answer:  Instead of iterating through each mile, we can directly calculate the total infection severity by summing |departure - boarding| + 1 for each passenger and taking the modulo after accumulating the sum. This avoids explicit iteration over the miles.\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Determine the minimum boarding coordinate and the maximum departure coordinate from all passengers.
