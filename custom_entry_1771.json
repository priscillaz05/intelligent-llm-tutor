Once exhausted by long political struggles and catastrophes, the city has decided to leave the fate of all candidates to the lottery in order to choose all candidates fairly and to make those born under the lucky star the mayor. I did. It is a lottery later called Amidakuji.\\n\\nThe election is held as follows. The same number of long vertical lines as the number of candidates will be drawn, and some horizontal lines will be drawn there. Horizontal lines are drawn so as to connect the middle of adjacent vertical lines. Below one of the vertical lines is written \\\"Winning\\\". Which vertical line is the winner is hidden from the candidates. Each candidate selects one vertical line. Once all candidates have been selected, each candidate follows the line from top to bottom. However, if a horizontal line is found during the movement, it moves to the vertical line on the opposite side to which the horizontal line is connected, and then traces downward. When you reach the bottom of the vertical line, the person who says \\\"winning\\\" will be elected and become the next mayor.\\n\\nThis method worked. Under the lucky mayor, a peaceful era with few conflicts and disasters continued. However, in recent years, due to population growth, the limits of this method have become apparent. As the number of candidates increased, the Amidakuji became large-scale, and manual tabulation took a lot of time. Therefore, the city asked you, the programmer of the city hall, to computerize the Midakuji.\\n\\nYour job is to write a program that finds the structure of the Amidakuji and which vertical line you will eventually reach given the position of the selected vertical line.\\n\\nThe figure below shows the contents of the input and output given as a sample.\\n\\n<image>\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe input consists of multiple datasets.

Each dataset describes the Amidakuji structure with n vertical lines, m horizontal lines, and the starting vertical line 'a' chosen by the candidate. The horizontal lines are defined by their height 'h' and the two adjacent vertical lines 'p' and 'q' they connect.\\n- Data Structure Choice: A list of horizontal lines can be used to represent the Amidakuji structure. Sorting the horizontal lines by height can help in simulating the traversal.\\n- Algorithm Design: Start at the initial vertical line 'a'. Iterate through the horizontal lines in descending order of height (from top to bottom). If the current vertical line is connected to a horizontal line, switch to the other vertical line connected by that horizontal line. Continue until all horizontal lines have been processed.\\n- Termination Condition: The input ends when n, m, and a are all 0.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How should I represent the Amidakuji structure to efficiently simulate the path?\",\n    \"How do I determine if a candidate on a particular vertical line encounters a horizontal line?\",\n    \"What should be the order in which I process the horizontal lines?\",\n    \"How do I handle multiple datasets in the input?\",\n    \"How do I know when to stop processing datasets?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A list of tuples or lists, where each item represents a horizontal line with its height and the two connected vertical lines, is a suitable representation.\",\n    \"Check if the current vertical line matches either of the vertical lines connected by the horizontal line. If it matches, then the candidate encounters a horizontal line.\",\n    \"Process the horizontal lines in the order the candidate would encounter them, which is from top to bottom (descending order of height).\",\n    \"Read and process each dataset within a loop until the termination condition is met.\",\n    \"The input ends when n, m, and a are all 0.
