Aim for an O(N) time complexity and O(N) space complexity in the worst case.\\n- Algorithmic Strategy: Iterate through the string, and for each character, check if it has been seen before. If not, add it to the result string and mark it as seen. This ensures both the removal of duplicates and the preservation of order.\\n- Handling Case Sensitivity: Understand that the problem requires distinguishing between uppercase and lowercase characters, meaning 'A' and 'a' should be treated as distinct characters.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the significance of preserving the original order of characters in the string?\",\n    \"What data structure is most suitable for efficient checking of duplicate characters, considering the constraints?\",\n    \"How would you handle both uppercase and lowercase characters to ensure they are treated as distinct entities?\",\n    \"How can you guarantee that the time complexity remains O(N) even when checking for duplicates?\",\n    \"What is the expected output if the input string is empty?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Preserving the original order ensures that the output string reflects the original sequence of characters, excluding duplicates.
