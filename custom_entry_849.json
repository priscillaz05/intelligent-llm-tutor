With so many passengers wanting to get aboard his bus, he sometimes has to face the problem of not enough space left on the bus! He wants you to write a simple program telling him if he will be able to fit all the passengers.\\n\\n### Task Overview:\\n\\nYou have to write a function that accepts three parameters: \\n* `cap` is the amount of people the bus can hold excluding the driver.\\n* `on` is the number of people on the bus.\\n* `wait` is the number of people waiting to get on to the bus. \\n\\nIf there is enough space, return 0, and if there isn't, return the number of passengers he can't take.\\n\\n### Usage Examples:\\n\\n```python\\nenough(10, 5, 5)\\n0 # He can fit all 5 passengers\\nenough(100, 60, 50)\\n10 # He can't fit 10 out of 50 waiting\\n```\\n\\n```if:csharp\\nDocumentation:\\nKata.Enough Method (Int32, Int32, Int32)\\n\\nReturns the number of passengers the bus cannot fit, or 0 if the bus can fit every passenger.\\n\\nSyntax\\n\\n\\npublic\\nstatic\\nint Enough(\\nint cap,\\n  \\u00a0\\u00a0int on,\\nint wait\\n  \\u00a0\\u00a0)\\n  \\n\\n\\nParameters\\n\\ncap\\n\\nType: System.Int32\\nThe amount of people that can fit on the bus excluding the driver.\\n\\non\\n\\nType: System.Int32\\nThe amount of people on the bus excluding the driver.\\n\\nwait\\n\\nType: System.Int32\\nThe amount of people waiting to enter the bus.\\n\\nReturn Value\\n\\nType: System.Int32\\n  An integer representing how many passengers cannot fit on the bus, or 0 if every passenger can fit on the bus.\\n\\n```\",\n  \"Ground Truth Solution\": \"def enough(cap, on, wait):\\n\\treturn max(0, wait - (cap - on))\",\n  \"LLM CoT Steps Breakdown\": \"- Understanding the Problem: The goal is to determine if the bus has enough capacity for all waiting passengers, given the bus's capacity, the number of passengers already on board, and the number of waiting passengers.\\n- Calculating Available Space: Calculate the remaining space on the bus by subtracting the number of passengers currently on the bus from the bus's total capacity.\\n- Determining if There is Enough Space: Compare the number of waiting passengers to the available space on the bus.\\n- Returning the Appropriate Result: If there is enough space (or exactly enough space), return 0. If there isn't enough space, return the number of passengers that cannot be accommodated.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you calculate the available space on the bus given its capacity and the number of passengers already on board?\",\n    \"How do you determine if the bus has enough space for all waiting passengers?\",\n    \"What should the function return if there is enough space on the bus?\",\n    \"What should the function return if there isn't enough space on the bus?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Subtract the number of passengers already on the bus (`on`) from the bus's total capacity (`cap`).\",\n    \"Compare the number of waiting passengers (`wait`) to the available space (calculated as `cap - on`). If `wait` is less than or equal to `cap - on`, there is enough space.\",\n    \"Return 0, indicating that all waiting passengers can be accommodated.\",\n    \"Return the difference between the number of waiting passengers and the available space, which represents the number of passengers that cannot be accommodated. This value should be `wait - (cap - on)`.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
