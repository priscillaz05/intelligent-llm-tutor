The only allowed operation is rearranging a subarray whose first and last elements have differing polarities. The task is to find the minimum number of such operations to sort the array.\\n- Identifying Key Constraints: The polarity of each element must remain unchanged. The operation involves rearranging a subarray, and the subarray must have different polarities at its boundaries.\\n- Devising a Strategy: First, check if the array is already sorted. If so, no operations are needed. If not, determine if the array can be sorted using the given operations. To do this, identify the first and last positions where the sorted array differs from the original array. Then, check if there are both North and South polarities available within that range.\\n- Edge Cases and Impossible Scenarios: Consider the case where the array is already sorted (0 operations). Also, consider the case where the array can never be sorted because all elements have the same polarity, and the sorted version requires different polarities in the array.\\n- Implementation Details: Store the polarities as a string. Find the indices where the sorted array differs from the original. Use the polarity string to determine if a valid operation (subarray with different polarities at ends) can be performed to sort the array. If the entire array needs to be sorted and both polarities exist, a single operation suffices. Otherwise, it might take two operations. If no operations can be performed because of a lack of mixed polarities, return -1.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the possible polarities of the array elements, and how do they affect the sorting operations?\",\n    \"What conditions must be met to perform a valid rearrangement operation on a subarray?\",\n    \"If the array isn't sorted initially, how can you determine the minimum number of rearrangement operations required, and when is it impossible to sort the array?\",\n    \"How do you handle the edge case where the input array is already sorted?\",\n    \"How do you determine whether two operations are required?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The array elements can have either North or South polarity. A rearrangement operation is only valid on a subarray if the first and last elements have different polarities. This constraint directly affects which subarrays can be used to sort the array.\",\n    \"To perform a valid rearrangement operation, the first and last elements of the chosen subarray must have different polarities.\",\n    \"First, sort a copy of the array. If the sorted array differs from the original array, identify the start and end indices of the differing sections. If both North and South polarities are available within the range of the differing indices, one or two operations might be sufficient. If the entire array requires sorting and a mix of polarities exists, then one operation can achieve the sorted array. If no mixed polarities exist, the array cannot be sorted (-1).\",\n    \"If the input array is already sorted, the minimum number of operations required is 0.\",\n    \"Two operations are required if both North and South polarities exist in the array, but a single subarray rearrangement cannot directly sort the entire array that needs to be sorted. This generally happens when the differing elements are scattered and require multiple distinct subarray operations, or when a single subarray operation can't span the entirety of the incorrect elements. If the array contains both North and South polarities, two operations may be necessary to reorder segments effectively. The conditions include both polarities existing within the unsorted ranges but no single operation suffices. \"\n  ]\n}\n```"
