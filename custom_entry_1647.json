Notice that LCM(a, b) / a = b / GCD(a, b).\\n- Simplifying the Expression: The expression b / GCD(a, b) can only take on certain values. Specifically, GCD(a, b) must be a divisor of b. Let d = GCD(a, b). Then the expression becomes b / d. Since d is a divisor of b, b / d will also be a divisor of b. The possible values of b / GCD(a, b) are the divisors of b.\\n- Finding the Number of Divisors: The problem now reduces to finding the number of divisors of b.\\n- Implementation Strategy: Iterate through numbers from 1 up to the square root of b. If i is a divisor, then b/i is also a divisor. Take care to handle perfect squares to avoid counting the same divisor twice.\\n\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the mathematical relationship between LCM(a, b), a, b, and GCD(a, b)?\",\n    \"How does the expression LCM(a, b) / a simplify, and what does this simplification reveal about the possible values?\",\n    \"Given the simplified expression, what are the constraints on the values it can take?\",\n    \"How does finding the number of distinct values relate to finding the divisors of b?\",\n    \"What is an efficient approach for counting the number of divisors of a given number, and how should edge cases like perfect squares be handled?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"LCM(a, b) * GCD(a, b) = a * b\",\n    \"LCM(a, b) / a = b / GCD(a, b).
