The developers made a new function GAZ-GIZ, which infinitely fills an infinite table to the right and down from the upper left corner as follows:\\n\\n [Image]  The cell with coordinates $(x, y)$ is at the intersection of $x$-th row and $y$-th column. Upper left cell $(1,1)$ contains an integer $1$.\\n\\nThe developers of the SUM function don't sleep either. Because of the boredom, they teamed up with the developers of the RAND function, so they added the ability to calculate the sum on an arbitrary path from one cell to another, moving down or right. Formally, from the cell $(x,y)$ in one step you can move to the cell $(x+1, y)$ or $(x, y+1)$. \\n\\nAfter another Dinwows update, Levian started to study \\\"Celex-2021\\\" (because he wants to be an accountant!). After filling in the table with the GAZ-GIZ function, he asked you to calculate the quantity of possible different amounts on the path from a given cell $(x_1, y_1)$ to another given cell $(x_2, y_2$), if you can only move one cell down or right.\\n\\nFormally, consider all the paths from the cell $(x_1, y_1)$ to cell $(x_2, y_2)$ such that each next cell in the path is located either to the down or to the right of the previous one.

We can only move down or right.\\n- Identifying the pattern: The value in cell (x, y) can be seen as the sum of x and y -1. More formally, the number in the cell (x,y) is the sum of row and column number minus one. Each path from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) consists of (x2-x1) downward moves and (y2-y1) rightward moves. The problem is equivalent to finding how many different sums can be generated while traversing from the starting cell to end cell in all possible paths.\\n- Deriving the formula:  The minimum sum is obtained by going all the way down first and then all the way right. The maximum sum is obtained by going all the way right first and then all the way down. Each time we switch a down move with a right move, we get a different path and a different sum. Let's analyze the range of different sums possible. As we move down or right, the value of the new cell increases.  The key observation here is that the difference between the maximum possible sum and minimum possible sum is (x2 - x1) * (y2 - y1). And the sums increase consecutively. Therefore the total possible sums would be the difference + 1, i.e., (x2 - x1) * (y2 - y1) + 1.\\n- Considering edge cases: If (x1, y1) is the same as (x2, y2), there is only one path and the number of different sums is 1. This condition is implicitly taken care of by the formula.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"Can you explain the constraints on movements from one cell to another?\",\n    \"How is the value in each cell of the infinite table determined?\",\n    \"What is the minimum number of steps required to move from cell (x1, y1) to cell (x2, y2)?\",\n    \"How can we efficiently calculate the number of different possible sums without explicitly calculating all possible paths?\",\n    \"Are there any edge cases where the result might be trivially determined, such as when the starting and ending cells are identical?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"You can only move to the cell directly below (x+1, y) or the cell directly to the right (x, y+1).\",\n    \"The value in the cell (x, y) can be seen as x+y-1.\",\n    \"The minimum number of steps to move from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) is (x2 - x1) + (y2 - y1).\",\n    \"The number of different sums is equal to `(x2 - x1) * (y2 - y1) + 1`.\",\n    \"Yes, if (x1, y1) is equal to (x2, y2), then there is only one path and the result is 1.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
