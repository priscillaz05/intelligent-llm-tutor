If no such permutation exists, output -1.\\n- Identifying Constraints and Edge Cases: The given integers are constrained as $1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le n$ and $1 \\\\le s \\\\le \\\\frac{n (n+1)}{2}$.  The permutation must contain each number from 1 to n exactly once. The sum 's' has to be attainable using 'r-l+1' numbers from 1 to n. If the minimal possible sum (1+2+...+ (r-l+1)) is greater than s or maximal possible sum (n + (n-1) +...+ (n-(r-l))) is less than s, then it's impossible.\\n- Developing an Algorithm: First, check if it is possible to form such permutation. The minimum sum is $\\\\frac{(r-l+1)(1+(r-l+1))}{2}$ and maximum sum is $\\\\frac{(r-l+1)(2n - (r-l))}{2}$.\\nIf it's possible, build subarray that satisfies the given condition. Start filling from the largest possible values from range $1...n$. Remaining elements fill with available elements. \\n- Handling Duplicates: We need to make sure there are no duplicates in the final array. While filling the array we mark elements that already exists.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What are the constraints on n, l, r, and s?\",\n    \"How do you determine if a valid permutation exists for the given n, l, r, and s?\",\n    \"How do you generate a candidate subarray that satisfies the sum condition?\",\n    \"How do you ensure the final output is a permutation, avoiding duplicates?\",\n    \"How would you approach constructing the permutation around the subarray that sums up to 's'?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The problem states the following constraints: $1 \\\\le l \\\\le r \\\\le n$ and $1 \\\\le s \\\\le \\\\frac{n (n+1)}{2}$.\",\n    \"To check the existence, calculate the minimum and maximum possible sum of (r-l+1) distinct numbers from 1 to n.
