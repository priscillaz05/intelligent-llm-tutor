If no such number exists within the first K numbers of the sequence, return -1.\\n- Identifying Constraints and Edge Cases: Note that K is between 1 and 10^6. If K is even, no multiple of K can be formed since all numbers in the sequence are odd. This optimization is crucial.\\n- Developing an Algorithm: Start with 7. In each step, multiply the current number by 10 and add 7. Check if the result is divisible by K. If it is, return the current step number. To avoid large numbers, take the modulo K in each step.\\n- Optimizing for Efficiency: The maximum number of iterations is K, since if there is no multiple of K within K numbers, there won't be any. Applying modulo operation makes the computation efficient.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What is the core task of the problem, and what output is expected?\",\n    \"What constraints are given for the input K, and are there any specific edge cases we should consider based on these constraints?\",\n    \"How can the sequence 7, 77, 777, ... be efficiently generated and tested for divisibility by K?\",\n    \"If K is an even number, can we make an early decision about the output?\",\n    \"How many numbers of the sequence need to be checked at most before concluding that there is no multiple of K?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"The task is to find the smallest number in the sequence 7, 77, 777, ... that is a multiple of K, and the expected output is the position of the first such number.
