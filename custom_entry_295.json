This means that if a bit is set in $n$, the corresponding bit in $x$ must be 0.\\n- Identifying Key Conditions: Understand that the number of possible values for $x$ depends on the number of zero bits in $n$. For each zero bit in $n$, the corresponding bit in $x$ can be either 0 or 1, doubling the possible number of $x$ values.\\n- Counting Zero Bits: Develop an efficient method to count the number of zero bits in the binary representation of $n$.\\n- Handling Constraints: Account for the constraint $0 \\\\le x \\\\le n$. In scenarios where $n+x = n \\\\oplus x$, this contraint is automatically satisfied if all bits set in x are not set in n and $x <= n$. Specifically, $x$ will be valid if all bits in $x$ are zero at the same position where $n$ has its bits set to $1$.\\n- Edge cases: Consider edge case of $n=0$.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"What does the condition $n + x = n \\\\oplus x$ imply about the binary representations of $n$ and $x$?\",\n    \"How does the number of zero bits in the binary representation of $n$ affect the number of possible values for $x$?\",\n    \"Can you describe an algorithm to efficiently count the number of zero bits in the binary representation of a number?\",\n    \"How would you handle the constraint $0 \\\\le x \\\\le n$ while ensuring $n+x=n \\\\oplus x$?\",\n    \"What should be the returned value when $n=0$?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"It implies that there are no carry bits when adding $n$ and $x$.
