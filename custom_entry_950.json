Each day has a specific rule determining if a number is scary.\\n- Data Structures: A dictionary can efficiently map days to their corresponding rules.\\n- Implementing the Logic: Extract the day of the week from the input, use it as the key to a dictionary of rules, and evaluate the input number against that rule. The function returns True if the number is 'scary' and False otherwise.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How would you represent the association between days of the week and their corresponding scary number rules?\",\n    \"What's the best way to handle the different rules for each day (equality, greater than, divisibility, or)\",\n    \"How can you implement the function to efficiently check the rules and return a boolean value?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"A dictionary with the days of the week as keys and the corresponding scary number rules (as boolean conditions) as values.\",\n    \"I can use conditional statements or boolean expressions within the dictionary values to implement each day's rule.\",\n    \"The function should take the day and number as input, retrieve the rule from the dictionary using the day, evaluate the number against the rule, and return the boolean result of that evaluation.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
