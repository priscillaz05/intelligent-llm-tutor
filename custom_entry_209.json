If multiple such indices exist, return the leftmost one; otherwise, return -1.\\n- Identifying Edge Cases: Consider cases where the array is empty or has only one element, or when no such pivot index exists.\\n- Algorithm Selection: Use a method involving calculating the total sum of the array and iterating through the array to check for the pivot index by maintaining left and right sums.\\n- Optimization and Efficiency: Minimize redundant calculations by updating sums incrementally instead of recalculating them for each index.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do you handle the case where the array is empty or contains a single element?\",\n    \"What initial values should be assigned to the left and right sums before iterating through the array?\",\n    \"How can you efficiently update the left and right sums as you iterate through the array to check for the pivot index?\",\n    \"What should you return if no pivot index is found after traversing the entire array?\",\n    \"How can you ensure that your solution returns the leftmost pivot index if multiple pivots exist?\"\n  ],\n  \"Expected Answers to LLM Questions\": [\n    \"If the array is empty, return -1. If it contains a single element, the pivot index is 0 because both the left and right sums are 0.\",\n    \"Initially, the left sum should be 0, and the right sum should be the total sum of all elements in the array.\",\n    \"As you iterate through the array, subtract the current element from the right sum and add it to the left sum. Then check if left == right.\",\n    \"If the loop completes without finding a pivot index, return -1.\",\n    \"The algorithm returns the index during the first instance when left == right, because iteration happens from left to right, it naturally returns the leftmost pivot index.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
