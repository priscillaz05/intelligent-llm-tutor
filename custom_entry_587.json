The preorder traversal gives the root, the inorder traversal gives the left and right subtrees, and the postorder traversal ends with the root.\\n- Relating Traversal Orders: Understand that for the traversals to represent the same tree, the root node found in preorder must match the root node found in postorder. Inorder traversal helps determine the structure of left and right subtrees relative to the root.\\n- Recursive Verification Strategy: Plan a recursive approach to break down the problem into smaller subproblems. Use the root from the preorder traversal to split the inorder traversal into left and right subtrees. Verify recursively that the left and right subtrees also satisfy the traversal properties. Ensure that the indices are correctly adjusted.\\n- Handling Edge Cases: Account for edge cases such as an empty tree (or subtree), which should return true. Consider cases where the root element is not found in the inorder traversal, which would indicate the traversals are inconsistent and should return false.\",\n  \"LLM Questions\": [\n    \"How do the properties of preorder, inorder, and postorder traversals relate to the structure of a binary tree, and how can this inform our validation process?\",\n    \"Expected Answer: Preorder gives the root first, inorder gives the left subtree then root, and postorder gives the root last.
