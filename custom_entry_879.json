One day his naughtiness lead him to a demon Kali(THE COBRA COMMANDER) who trapped him into a triangular magic cell. Handi Bhaiya parents want their kid back and asks for your help.\\n\\nACT II\\nYou knew that the entire humanity will hate you but then also you decided to rescue Handi Bhaiya (don't ask why). You went to Kali and asked to release Handi Bhiaya. Kali being good by heart decided to free him but you have to solve a puzzle first.\\n\\nPuzzle\\nKali asks to write you a program that will tell whether Handi Bhaiya can be inside the given cell or not, for T(1 \u2264 T \u2264 10^6) test cases. For each test case you will be given a cell(not necessarily closed and bounded) that will have 3 integral sides- a, b and c representing the sides of cell. You have to tell whether Handi can be inside that cell or not. Remember that the cell was triangular in which he was trapped.\\nIf the cell is triangular then also print the type of triangle - isosceles, equilateral or scalene.

Also, ensure to compare the sides correctly to determine the type of triangle.\\n- Selecting an Algorithmic Strategy: Read the number of test cases T. For each test case, read the three side lengths. Check if the triangle inequality holds for all combinations of sides. If it does, determine the type of triangle based on the equality of the sides, and print corresponding output. If the triangle inequality does not hold, output \\\"NO\\\".\\n- Implementation Considerations: Efficiently handle multiple test cases within the time limit. Ensure accurate type determination based on side length comparisons.
